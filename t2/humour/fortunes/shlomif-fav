Personally, I'd have a far better time writing scripts if I had some more
creative shells to script in...

ASMsh: The Assembly shell. Commands include MOV, SHL, SHR, JNE, etc.

shellTM: Turing machine shell. Only four commands. Read, write, move left,
move right. Capable of producing any programming language imaginable, given
enough time and nerves of steel.

GeneSH: Four commands. G, A, T, C. Need I say more?

Qsh: Only uses one environment variable, which contains all possible values
simultaneously. Method of scripting: isolate the universe in which the
desired result is already accomplished, and intersect with it.

Of course, I never said they'd be easy to use. But then, if these shells
existed, and I knew a sysadmin who used any of them, you can believe
Sysadmin Day would be a far more celebrated holiday.

In fact, I think Linus's [= Linus Torvalds'] cleverest and most consequential

invention of the Linux development model.  When I expressed this
opinion in his presence once, he smiled and quietly repeated something
he has often said: "I'm basically a very lazy person who likes to get

And we should all digitally sign every single object too, and we should
use 4096-bit PGP keys and unguessable passphrases that are at least 20
words in length. And we should then build a bunker 5 miles underground,

The dictionary definition of capitalism is: An economic system characterized
by private ownership of capital goods and by investments that are determined
by private decision rather than by state control. Prices, production and
distribution of goods are determined by a free market. 

...

But most writers and commentators put dishonest altruistic-platonistic
connotations on the meaning of capitalism: A system of exploitation of the
weak by the strong -- devoid of love and good will. A system in which
unwanted goods and services are pushed onto consumers through clever,
deceptive advertising for the sole purpose of profits and greed. Capitalism
dominates most Western governments. Capitalism, big business, and fascism
are synonymous.

Yet, acting on fully integrated honesty (Neo-Tech), not reason itself, is
the basic moral act. When Genghis Khan, for example, chose to use reasoning
for a specific military move, then in an out-of-context sense, he chose to
act morally by protecting himself and his troops (thus filling human
biological needs). But in the larger sense of fully integrated honesty,
Khan's total actions were grossly immoral in choosing to use aggressive
force in becoming a mass murderer (thus negating human biological needs).
The highly destructive, irrational immorality of Genghis Khan's overall
dictatorial military actions far outweighed any narrow, out-of-context
"moral" actions. ...Genghis Khan was enormously evil as were Stalin, Hitler,
Mao, Castro, Pol Pot.

Why are there so many unmaintainable applications written in PHP and Perl?
Because PHP and Perl let undisciplined, inexperienced programmers write
useful code. So does Ruby -- but give it the popularity and longevity of PHP
and Perl (at least in English-speaking circles) and I bet you'll see plenty
of bad code written in Ruby too.

This seems like a variant of the Hackers and Painters fallacy. (Paul Graham
is rich. Paul Graham writes Lisp. Therefore everyone who writes Lisp will
get rich.) "All of the good, smart programmers I know are using Ruby. They
write good code. Therefore you can't write bad code in Ruby!"

It feels like there's another fallacy in there somewhere. I want to call it
the Pre-Post-Java Blindspot, where Java was the beginning of Serious
Programming Languages and only its successor will unseat it. (Like any good
fallacy, you have to ignore history, such as the fact that Ruby's between 10
and 12 years old.)

(I mean, if you really just can't read regular expressions, why not admit
it? You could start a twelve-step program or something.)

Much of the relative simplicity of Java is - like for most new languages -
partly an illusion and partly a function of its incompleteness. As time
passes, Java will grow significantly in size and complexity. It will double
or triple in size and grow implementation-dependent extensions or libraries.
That is the way every commercially successful language has developed. Just
look at any language you consider successful on a large scale. I know of no
exceptions, and there are good reasons for this phenomenon. [I wrote this
before 2000; now see a preview of Java 1.5 - http://xrl.us/kb3a ]
