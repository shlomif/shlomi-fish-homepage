<p>
In this fan episode of the Television show
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine"><i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</i></a>,
we discover the true essence of the Q Continuum, and meet
some “living dead”: conscious beings (including humans) who reportedly died,
but actually were saved and still live a prosperous life some place
else in the universe, as well as “vampires”: individuals who never died and
have instead remained alive since they were born.
</p>

<p>
A Star Trek episode to end all Star Trek episodes, (and, more
generally - story to end all stories).
