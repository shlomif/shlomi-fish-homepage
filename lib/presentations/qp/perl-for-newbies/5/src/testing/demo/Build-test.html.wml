<p>
Standard CPAN and CPAN-like Perl packages contain their tests as a group
of <tt>*.t</tt> under the sub-directory <tt>t/</tt>, and allow running them
by invoking the <tt>make test</tt> or <tt>./Build test</tt> commands.
</p>

<p>
Using the CPAN package
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Starter/">Module-Starter</a>
one can generate a skeleton for one’s own CPAN-like package, which
can also afterwards contain tests. Keeping your code organised in such packages,
allows one to make use of a convenient build-system
such as <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Build/">Module-Build</a>.
It also allows one to package it as operating-system-wide packages, which can
be removed easily using the system's package manager. Finally, these packages
can later be uploaded to CPAN for sharing with other users and developers.

Here’s an example of testing a CPAN distribution from CPAN using
<tt>./Build test</tt>:
