<p>
The first thing we should do is change the directory to the directory that
Module-Starter created and run <code>perl Build.PL</code>. We get some
output like the following:
</p>

<quadpres_code_file filename="src/module-build-and-starter/perl-Build-PL-1-output.txt" />

<p>
What the <code>perl Build.PL</code> command does is generate the <code>Build</code>
script in the current directory that can be used to perform such operations
as building, testing, packaging, and installing of the distribution. Sometimes
we need to re-run <code>perl Build.PL</code> if we modified the configuration.
</p>

<p>
Now let's run <code>./Build</code> and <code>./Build test</code>.
</p>

<quadpres_code_file filename="src/module-build-and-starter/perl-Build-and-Build-test-1.txt" />

<p>
What happens is that <code>./Build</code> copies the files under <code>blib/</code>
, builds the documentation, and in case we had
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XS_%28Perl%29">XS (= "External Subroutine" - perl routines written in a low-level language)</a> it
would also build the extensions. This allows us to run tests against the
built code, either automated or manual by using the
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/blib.html">blib module</a>.
</p>

<p>
After we had ran <code>./Build</code>, we ran <code>./Build test</code> to run the
automated tests that Module-Starter generated for us. As you can see
the line says that all tests successful. If they were not, we should fix
either the code or the tests, depending on what is wrong.
</p>

<p>
Now let's move on.
