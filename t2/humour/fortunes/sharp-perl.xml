          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: I found out that my project compiles really quickly.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: under 5 or 10 minutes on a P4-2.4GHz with 1 GB of RAM.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: maybe KDE is making g++ look bad.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">rindolf: yeah, i'm not a big KDE fan</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: actually I'm using KDE-3.5.8 here.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: I was talking about the compilation speed of KDE apps and KDE itself.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: possibly because each file has half-a-gazillion headers.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">My C++ code is a server one, so we don't have too many deps.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">yeah, isn't there a way to cache header files? ie. in their "compiled" form?</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">or is that something I'm remembering from some other programming language that purported to build on top of C?</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: MSVC has that.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">ahh, nods</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: no, Visual C++ has precompiled headers.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: I remember that I kept deleting them.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">yeah, couldn't remember</saying>

          <saying who="rindolf">Pascal compiles very quickly.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">That's one of the things I enjoyed in Delphi.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">ugh, the app i'm been maintaining in Java was originally a fat client/server desktop app, written in Delphi</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: ah.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">i remember booting up the old app for the first time, and being amazed at how slow it was</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">eventually, i had to duplicate a feature in the Java code and i wasn't sure how it was implemented before</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: you mean the Java app is faster? :S</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">so being as i had no Delphi experience, and the newer Delphi environments made NO sense to me at all, i just opened up the SQL Server query analyzer</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">rindolf: yes, but only b/c the Delphi programmer was an idiot, issuing queries over and over again needlessly</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">rindolf: if you could've seen the MSSQL Performance Analyzer or whatever, it was basically just.. Query1, Query2, Query3, Query1, Query2, Query3, repeat.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">it was probably the worst ive ever seen in my life.. belongs on www.thedailywtf.com </saying>

<saying who="ne2k__">yrlnry: not that it has anything to do with perl, but the &lt;input&gt; tag in HTML has both &quot;name&quot; and &quot;value&quot; attributes. the value is what gets shown in the browser typically.</saying>

<saying who="perlygatekeeper">rindolf was that someone pretending to be me?</saying>
<saying who="perlygatekeeper">I never said those things</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlygatekeeper: it&#39;s a fictitious story.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlygatekeeper: relax.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">perlygatekeeper: or you could be the imposter right now... or maybe just schizophrenic.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: MPDed not schizophrenic.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: schizophrenia is not Multi-Persona-Disordered.</saying>
<saying who="b0at">perlygatekeeper: It&#39;s fan fiction from your fan!</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">rindolf: what&#39;s the difference?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: MPD is when there are several personalities living inside your brain.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: in schizophrenia, you have one I-ness, but hear voices, hallucinate and stuff.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">rindolf: Ah. Why is it considered a disorder? MPD could be quite useful... One would have different perspectives on a subject.</saying>
<saying who="perlygatekeeper">where&#39;s beth, she&#39;ll know it&#39;s me</saying>
<saying who="integral">But how will we know it&#39;s beth?!</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">rindolf: Oh, I have MPD then, not schizophrenia. I don&#39;t hallucinate.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">integral: WE DON&#39;T!</saying>
<saying who="b0at">I don&#39;t hallucinate, but my other personality does.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">How do I know all of you exist? Am I just a figment of my own imagination?</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">b0at: Interesting...</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: Julian Jaynes describes schizophrenia very well in his &quot;The Origins of Consciousness during the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind book&quot;.</saying>

<saying who="dabreegster">Wait, I do have the Voices. Maybe I have MPD _and_ schizophrenia.</saying>
<saying who="b0at">Ah, but the question is: do the Voices have voices?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Consciousness_in_the_Breakdown_of_the_Bicameral_Mind</saying>
<saying who="b0at">And if so, is it your own voice?</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">b0at: And do the voices of the voices have voices?</saying>
<saying who="b0at">That&#39;s just going too far.</saying>
<saying who="dkr">don&#39;t worry, those are angels, invest in tarot cards and you will be able to understand them</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">b0at: and if it&#39;s not, then could it be the voice of........ integral? rindolf? or.... buu!</saying>
<saying who="b0at">buu has other plans for our empty skulls</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">b0at: and if they do, then what do the voices of the voices of the voices of the Voices sound like?</saying>
<saying who="integral">*sob* it&#39;s the cabbages.   The cabbages keep telling me to do things</saying>

<saying who="dabreegster">The lawn gnomes tell me to stay away from Life. They force me to write poetry.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">markl_: there are plenty of other web-devel frameworks.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlbot: web frameworks</saying>
<saying who="perlbot">rindolf: CGI-Application (and Titanium), CGI-Application-Plus, CGI-Builder, CGI-Prototype, Jifty, Catalyst (and Reaction), Mojo, SweetPea, Dancer, Gantry, AxKit, WebGUI</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">markl_: yeah.</saying>
<saying who="markl_">what are the easiest ones for people good with perl but not HTML/CSS/AJAX experts ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">markl_: not that Ruby or PHP have fewer.</saying>
<saying who="markl_">or the most widely adopted one ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">markl_: the most popular appears to be Catalyst.</saying>
<saying who="markl_">catalyst seems to at least have a book :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">markl_: it has several books.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">markl_: I worked a bit with Mojolicious, and it wasn&#39;t too bad, but it reinvents a lot of wheels.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Due to its philosophy.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">markl_: I also did some Catalyst projects.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">mst: I think that&#39;s the case, no need to preach to mutewit about it.</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">mutewit: I did, and figured out the soln. when switching windows.</saying>
<saying who="mst">mutewit: aye. I&#39;m just trying to explain how to get the most learning out of us as well as the most working code.</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">sometimes thinks we spend much more IRC volume discussing netiquette than actually suffering from the bad netiquette.</me_is>
<saying who="mutewit">But by the time I came back to the channel there was a whole page of &quot;preaching&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">I was using a split method with array indexing and it felt too much like a C-approach.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: oh, you split the string into chars?</saying>
<saying who="mst">yeah, by the time you&#39;ve done map, join, split, ...</saying>
<saying who="mst">you&#39;ve basically just reimplemented substr badly :)</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">rindolf: That&#39;s what I was doing, but the map/substr approach is a lot cleaner.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: yeah/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: split into chars sometimes has some uses.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: but this reminds me too much of SICP.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlbot: sicp</saying>
<saying who="perlbot">rindolf: http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/ - &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot; - A Classical Text on Programming</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: see - http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Too-Many-Ways/slides/slide13.html</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: this is how an SICP programmer will implement a simple text processing task.</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">SICP, love the book.</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">and all the OCaml work this year has given rise to a functional bent of mind</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">which is kinda screwing around with my perl code.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: yeah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Too-Many-Ways/slides/slide12.html - this is the fastest Perl solution.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">At least in speed.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">It can be a little shorter with a regex lookahead, but it&#39;s less elegant and slower.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Too-Many-Ways/slides/slide9.html - there you go.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: did you know how to program before reading SICP?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I think it&#39;s not a good introductory book.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">MIT are going to ditch it in favour of some Python/Robotics curriculum.</saying>
<saying who="mst">I think it&#39;s only a good introductory book if you know some math and have the brain to follow it</saying>
<saying who="mst">it teaches a lot of hard concepts very quickly</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">mst: from a &quot;I&#39;m from the humanities department&quot; point of view it&#39;s managable. it&#39;s not easy, but everyone can work with it.</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">eval: $_ = &quot;0123456789abcdefgh&quot;; [ /(?=(.{5}))/g ]</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: ah. Using what?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">tybalt89++ # Up for the challenge.</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">and yes, MIT ditched SICP in favor of a Python-based intro course.</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">rindolf: I was off in other windows :(</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">mutewit: ^^  for 5 char slices</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: don&#39;t use it if you want future generations to understand it.</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">slaps tybalt89 with mst&#39;s slipper for golfing mutewit&#39;s solution and telling him it&#39;s a good idea.</me_is>
<saying who="tybalt89">rindolf: that&#39;s not golfing, just common simple regex :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">tybalt89: sigh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">tybalt89: simple.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">irregular regular expression.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Maybe use Regexp::Common</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">I added in tybalt89&#39;s code but commented it for future reference.</saying>
<saying who="mst">I&#39;d definitely use the substr approach for real code</saying>
<saying who="mst">tybalt89&#39;s code is cleverness to prove it can be done; I don&#39;t believe he was recommending it</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">mst: sigh, yes, I am recommending it.  It&#39;s the clearest solution.</saying>
<saying who="mst">tybalt89: I respectfully disagree.</saying>
<saying who="mst">I find the substr approach far more obvious</saying>
<saying who="Chazz">rindolf, ty. :)</saying>
<saying who="mst">but then, I mostly write applications perl rather than scripts, so I only engage in regexp cleverness when actively useful</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">tybalt89: look-aheads and look-behinds are dark corners of the Perl not-so-reg-regexes</saying>
<saying who="Yaakov">In the context of this particular problem, it&#39;s pretty straightforward, but, knowledge of the development/maintenance team(s) would push my choce one way or another.</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">mst: note it took rindolf three tries, and even then he got it wrong.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">tybalt89: well, I&#39;m not focused now.</saying>
<saying who="mst">tybalt89: map substr($str, $_, 5), 0 .. length($str)-5; ?</saying>
<saying who="mst">maybe -6</saying>
<me_is who="tybalt89">turns the lens, trying to focus rindolf </me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">mst: -5</saying>
<saying who="mst">but it&#39;s hardly difficult; rindolf&#39;s just having a day of silly mistakes</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Unit tests!</saying>
<saying who="mst">I&#39;d expect him to get it right first time when on form too :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Some clear code is hard to get right.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Doesn&#39;t make it less clear.</saying>
<saying who="mst">yeah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Most people will not write a correct binary search at first try.</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">&quot;maybe -6&quot; is proof of unclearness :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">But the correct binary search is easy to digest.</saying>
<saying who="mst">tybalt89: no, it&#39;s proof it&#39;s 8pm on a sunday and I&#39;m not particularly awake either</saying>
<saying who="mst">but your code just made me go &quot;hang on, WHAT?!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="mst">then I had to stop and dissect it</saying>
<saying who="mst">-then- I saw what you were doing</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mst++</saying>
<saying who="mst">also, the substr approach displays the semantics and the reasoning</saying>
<saying who="mst">whereas the regex approach displays, well, line noise, frankly</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mst: why don&#39;t we agree to disagree with tybalt89 ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mst: so how&#39;s the weather? ;-)</saying>

<saying who="rcsheets">that&#39;s... that&#39;s... horrid</saying>
<saying who="rcsheets">maybe they were off their medication</saying>
<saying who="pcard">heh</saying>
<saying who="Mimisbrunnr">that&#39;s like asking to port a GUI to an adding machine</saying>
<saying who="BinGOs">I am so glad all the drugs, alcohol and therapy have managed to destroy all my memories of COBOL</saying>
<saying who="rcsheets">i need to implement a restful web app on my abacus</saying>
<saying who="pcard">Mimisbrunnr: lol</saying>
<saying who="Mimisbrunnr">rcsheets: it could be done - but we will need a lot of booze</saying>
<saying who="Mimisbrunnr">get me drunk enough, I&#39;ll program on anything</saying>
<saying who="Mimisbrunnr">including your cat</saying>
<saying who="rcsheets">Mimisbrunnr: can we do the booze part without the cobol/abacus/etc?</saying>
<saying who="pcard">BinGOs: indeed.... I did Cobol way back, and it&#39;s not something I care to go back to</saying>
<saying who="BinGOs">Though I do still shudder subconsciously whilst watching BSG</saying>
<saying who="pcard">BinGOs: the original or the newer one?</saying>
<saying who="Mimisbrunnr">rcsheets - deal</saying>
<saying who="BinGOs">Whenever they go on about the Gods of COBOL.</saying>
<saying who="Mimisbrunnr">Ya R’lyeh! COBOL fhtagn!</saying>
<saying who="ZadYree">Huh? what does @array[$arg] mean in p5?</saying>
<saying who="pcard">it&#39;s an array slice</saying>
<saying who="pcard">or a slice of pie</saying>
<saying who="pcard">one of those</saying>
<saying who="rcsheets">mmm</saying>
<saying who="anno">a warnable offence</saying>
<saying who="rcsheets">array slice, a la mode</saying>
<saying who="pcard">for pie?</saying>
<saying who="pcard">warn if pie; ?</saying>
<saying who="ZadYree">heh</saying>
<saying who="pcard">oh I see</saying>
<saying who="pcard">warn &quot;Pie&#39;s done!&quot; if defined $pie;</saying>
<saying who="Mimisbrunnr">pcard: never warn if pie; rejoice if pie</saying>
<saying who="pcard">ah</saying>
<saying who="szr">say &quot;mmmmm, pie!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rcsheets">well, warning when it&#39;s done could make sense, inasmuch as you don&#39;t want to burn it</saying>
<saying who="pcard">rcsheets: yeah, like bell/beeper on an oven</saying>
<saying who="rcsheets">yes</saying>
<saying who="rcsheets">then the rejoice would be triggered when it&#39;s cool enough to eat</saying>
<saying who="Mimisbrunnr">sleep until ( $pie eq &#39;done&#39; );</saying>
<saying who="pcard">it&#39;s still up to the baker to actually turn off the oven and remove the pie</saying>
<saying who="Mimisbrunnr">hrmm, wait no, I would never wake up</saying>
<saying who="pcard">Mimisbrunnr: there you go</saying>
<saying who="pcard">aww</saying>
