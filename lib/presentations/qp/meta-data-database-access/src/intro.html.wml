Meta-Data Database Access (or MDDA for short) is a name which I gave to a
methodology that facilitates the maintenance of code that interacts with
databases.
</li>
<li>
With MDDA, one enumerates the fields inside the database with an array
of Perl 5 data-structures that describes them.
</li>
<li>
That way adding or modifying the fields of a table will many times involve
only one or two modification to the code, instead of completely going all
over it.
