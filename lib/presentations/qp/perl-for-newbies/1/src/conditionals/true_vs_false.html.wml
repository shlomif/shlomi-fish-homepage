<p>
In Perl every expression is considered true except for the following three
cases:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
The number <tt>0</tt>.
</li>
<li>
The empty string (<tt>""</tt>).
</li>
<li>
A special value called <tt>undef</tt>. This is the default value of every
variable that was not initialized before it was accessed.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
One of the most convenient ways of cancelling code is to wrap it in an 
<tt>if (0) { ... }</tt> block. It usually is faster than adding comments to
the beginning of each line. Of course, you should not distribute code that 
way, but it is useful for testing conjectures.
