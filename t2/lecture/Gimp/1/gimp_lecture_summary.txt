Introduction:
-------------

History of the GIMP:

http://www.gimp.org/~sjburges/gimp-history.html (Summarize)

Features: (with demos):
-----------------------

* Supports RGB, Grayscale and Indexed images.
    - Can convert between them, but converting a gray-scaled image to
    RGB will not add colours to it.

    - Demonstrate converting lena_color.jpg to grayscale and back
    to colour. (<Image> -> Image -> Mode)

    - Note: The <Image> menu is accessible by clicking the right mouse button
    or the arrow in the upper-left corner of the image.

    - Some effects are not avialable in all modes.

* Supports 8-bit per color value RGB and Grayscale image

    - Demonstrate with the colour picker.

    - There's a patch available at http://film.gimp.org that adds 16-bit
    precision to it. It will be integrated into the main source tree in
    Gimp 2.0.

* Supports RGB and HSV modes.

    - Demonstrate with the colour selector of the active colour.

    - Some explanation about what RGB and HSV is.

        - RGB: Red-Green-Black: Additive Colour components added to the graph.

        - HSV: Hue (A unit that specifies the "colour" of the colour),
        Saturation which specifies how much black, white or gray is mixed with
        it, and Value which corresponds to its brightness.

    - CMYK support will be added in GIMP 1.4.x or 2.0.x, but is not available
    at the moment.

        - CMYK stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and blacK and is a
          substractive method for specifying colours which in a similar
          manner to mixing paint colours.

* Several Basic effects can be performed using the Toolbox.

    Demonstrate:

    1. Create a new image (<Toolbox> -> File -> "New ...")

    2. Draw with the pencil, the paintbrush, the pattern painter.

    3. Create a Text caption.

* Effects and filters are implemented using Plug-ins. Plug-ins are separate
programs that communicate with the main program using pipes. Plug-ins use
libgimp to interact with the GIMP, and since libgimp is LGPLed, they can be
properietary.

There are also Script-Fu (= Scheme), Perl and Python extensions to the GIMP
which enables one to write filters and scripts in those languages.

    - Demonstrate on some image with the Blur filter.

Selection and its usage:
------------------------

(Demonstrate on tiger_sitting.jpg)

We can normally paint everywhere in the image but if we do a selection with
any one of the selection tools, we can only operate there. In a similar way,
filters only operate on the current selection.

Gimp Selections can be any subset of pixels. One can use the selection tools
in combination with the Ctrl, Shift and Alt keys to shape them.

Furthermore, by pressing the Red-Square Button at the bottom one can use
the standard painting tools to "paint" the selection.

The <Image> -> Select menu is handy in doing various common operations on
selections.

Layers:
-------

A gimp image is composed of layers. They can be viewed and manipulated
using the Layers Dialog (<Image> -> Layers -> "Layers, Channels and
Paths..."). These layers can be duplicated, deleted, moved, etc.

    Alpha:
    ------

    Every layer contains a special layer called the "alpha layer" that
    specifies its opacity. This layer is treated as a black and white bitmap
    that can be manipulated with all the normal tools, and in which black is
    considered full transparency (zero opacity) and white is full opacity
    between this layer and the layer below it.

    The Resultant pixel of the two layers is calculated using the formula:

    Result = (1-alpha) * Pixel(Below) + alpha * Pixel(Above)

        Demonstration:
        --------------

        1. Generate an image with:

        <Toolbox> -> Xtns -> Script-Fu -> Patterns -> "3D Truchet"

        2. Duplicate the layer using <Layers> -> Duplicate Layer

        3. Render a nice gradient on the lower layer.

        3. Generate an alpha by using <Layers> -> "Add Layer Mask..."
            (Set it to full opacity)

        4. Select the paintbrush tool and paint black strokes on the alpha
            of the above layer.

        5. Switch to a grey colour and paint grey strokes.

        6. Finalize the Layer's Mask using (<Layers> -> "Apply Layer Mask")

We can also use gradients as layer masks to create all kinds of fading
effects.

        Demo 2:
        -------

        1. Open lena.png

        2. Create a new layer and make it black. (using the new button)

        3. Place it below the lena image.

        4. Add a layer mask

        5. Switch the colours to white as foreground and black as background.

        6. Draw a foreground to background RGB gradient around lena's face.

            Note:
            -----

            My partner for "Image Processing & Analysis" and I worked for
            quite some time to create a similar effect in Matlab.

            (X .^ 2 + Y .^ 2) .^ (2.5) anyone?

Most filters affect only the active layer, so if you wish them to have
a commulative effect on a combination of layers you'll need to merge them
first (<Layers> -> "Merge Visible Layers..." or <Layers> -> "Flatten Image")

    Layer Modes:
    ------------

    Layers can be merged using other methods beside their Alpha. These are
    available in the "Mode" combo-box of the layers dialog.

        Demonstration:
        --------------

        1. Delete the Layer's Mask of the upper layer using "Delete Layer".

        2. Switch its Mode to Screen.

        3. Draw another gradient in a different direction in the upper layer.

        4. Switch the mode to Addition and then to Subtract and to other
        modes.

    The algorithms that are used to merge the various layers are described
    in the Gimp User's Manual.

Gradients:
----------

* Gradients can be drawn in various forms - linear, radial, conical, etc.

    Demonstrate

* A basic gradient can be created from the foreground colour to the
    background colour with either RGB or HSV interpolation.

* More complex gradients can be constructed using the Gradient Editor. To
    access it select <Toolbox> -> File -> Dialogs -> Gradients and then
    pressing the Edit button.

    - Demonstrate some basic gradient editting techniques.

LUT (Look-Up Tables) Effects:
=============================

Explanation: LUTs are transformations that act on every pixel based on his
value alone and not on the values of neighbouring pixels.

Brightness and Contrast:
------------------------

- Question: How can we increase/decrease the brightness and contrast of an
    image?

- Show the lookup table graph.

    Demonstrate:
    ------------

    1. Open lena.png

    2. Show its histogram (<Image> -> Image -> "Histogram...")

    3. Close the histogram.

    4. Access the Brightness and Contrast dialog
        (<Image> -> Image -> Colors -> "Brightness-Contrast...")

    5. Modify the Brightness and Contrast in some way.

        Note: the entire modified image is displayed in real-time because
        Brightness and Contrast changes are so easy to calculate.

    6. Open the Histogram dialog again to show its affects.

    7. Repeat if needed.

Gamma Correction:
-----------------

Q: How can we brighten or darken an image causing colour values
    to overflow?

    Concept:
    --------

    If we assume that the maximal colour value is 1 and the minimal is 0,
    then by applying a function of x ** (1/gamma) to every pixel we will
    modify the histogram while not overflowing from the image boundaries
    (which cannot be said on brightness and contrast manipulations).

    The more positive the gamme is the brighter the resultant image will be.

    - Show the graphs on the board.

    Demonstrate:
    ------------

    1. Open the "A-Little-Exercise-3.jpg" image.

    2. Run <Image> -> Image -> Colors -> "Levels...".

    3. Raise the value of the middle input box of "Input", and show the
    difference.

    4. Try to set the brightness/contrast on the original image and see
    that it doesn't work well.

Equalize:
---------

The "Equalize" operation constructs an appopriate Look-Up Table so that
the histogram of the resultant image will be more or less a constant
function.

Low colour values will remain lower than higher ones, but the spread of
them will change.

    Demonstrate:
    ------------

    1. Open the "Fiftenn-Cent-Ramen-1.jpg" picture

    2. Show its histogram.

    3. Equalize it using <Image> -> Image -> Colors -> Auto -> Equalize

    4. Looks Better, doesn't it?

    5. Show its histogram.

Color Map Rotation:
-------------------

So far we have seen LUTs from the V value to the V value. But there can also
be RGB -> RGB LUTs. An example of it is the Color Map Rotation which enables
us to swap a range of colours in other colours in the Hue spectrum.

    Demonstrate: (on tiger_sitting.jpg)
    ------------

    1. <Image> -> Image -> Colors -> "Colormap Rotation..."

    2. Replace the shades of brown and yellow with purple.

    3. Et voila: The Pink Panther.

    4. Undo.

    5. Convert the shades of green to browns and we get a tiger in the
    desert.

Color Balance:
--------------

Another Useful LUT is the Color Balance. It enables one to increase or
decrease the individual components of Red, Green and Blue for either
shadows, midtones or highlights.

    Demonstration:
    --------------

    1. Open lena_color.jpg

    2. Invoke the colour balance dialog by selecting
    <Image> -> Image -> Colors -> "Color Balance..."

    3. Play with the settings while trying to cancel the over-colouring
    of the picture as much as possible.

Note: there are more LUTs present in the GIMP. And if that's not enough
you may wish to play with the Gimp::Pixel PDL bindings. (which is the
GIMP's answer to the Image Toolbox of Matlab).

Basic Areal Effects:
====================

Blur:
-----

Q: How can one Blur?

    Demonstrate a simple Blur:
    --------------------------

    1. Open lena.png.

    2. <Image> -> Filters -> Generic -> "Convolution Matrix..."

    3. Set the 9 middle squares to 1 and the rest to 0 and the divisor to 9.

    4. Press the OK Button.

    5. Repeat several times with Alt+F
        (or <Image> -> Filters -> "Repeat Last")
        to strengthen the effect.

Gaussian blur is a blur with a two-dimensional Gaussian kernel as the kernel.
(not necessarily a symettrical Guassian). The GIMP sports two implementations
of Gaussian Blur: RLE Guassian Blur and IIR Guassian Blur. The two produce
more-or-less identical results but each one could be faster in some cases.

    (Show the Guassian Kernel on board)

    - RLE G. B. : I think it stands for Run-Length Encoding, but there's only
        a hint to it in the source code. This blur operates best on
        computer-generated images or those with large areas of constant
        intensity.

    - IIR G. B. : I think it stands for Infinite Impulse Responce (which is
        one of the methods to construct a digital filter), but again there's
        nothing in the documentation or the code to explain the initials. This
        blurring works best for large radius values and for images which are
        not computer generated.

    Demonstrate:
    ------------

    1. Open lena.png.

    2. Select <Image> -> Filters -> Blur -> "Gaussian Blur (IIR)...".

    3. Select radii of x = 5 and y = 5.

    4. Apply.

    5. Optionally select different images or radiuses and play with it.

    Demo 2:
    -------

    1. Create a blank white image.

    2. Place a black text caption on it using the text tool.

    2. Apply RLE Guassian Blur to it.

Sharpen:
--------

Q: How do we sharpen?

    Demo:
    -----

    1. Open lena_color.jpg

    2. Select <Image> -> Filters -> Enhance -> "Sharpen..."

    3. Show the results for various levels of Sharpen.

    4. A woodcut can be created using a sharpen level of 98.

Motion Blur:
------------

Q: How can one implement a motion blur?

    Demo:
    -----

    1. Open tiger_sitting.jpg

    2. Select <Image> -> Filters -> "Motion Blur..."

    3. Apply.

    4. Undo and play with the current settings.

Basic Areal Transformations:
============================

Scaling an Image:
-----------------

- Use the <Image> -> Image -> "Scale Image..." to scale an image.

- Demo on tiger_sitting.jpg

- When enlarging a picture, Gimp interpolates between the pixels (Q: How?)
so the picture does not look blocky, but not as good as the original either.

The Rotate/Scale/Perspective Tool:
----------------------------------

When having an active selection one can use the Transform tool to transform it
in several different ways.

    Demo:
    -----

    1. Do it on a real-life image and on a one containing a
        simple text message.

    2. Double Click the Transform tool to specify what kind of transformation
        you want.

    3. Use the mouse to control the transformation.

Some Cool Effects:
==================

Gradient Map:
-------------

Gradient map is in fact another LUT, which maps the V element of every pixel
to an RGB triad based on a gradient. The gradient is samples at 256 points and
the sample at each point is placed inside the image according to its
brightness.

    Demo:
    -----

    1. Open g_anwar1.jpg

    2. Select the German Flag Gradient.

    3. Select <Image> -> Filters -> Colors -> Map -> Gradient Map
        (That's the GIMP's record for menu depth)

    4. Undo

    5. Go to the Gradient Editor, create a copy of German Flag, and flip it.

    6. Select this copy.

    7. Apply a Gradient Map again.

    8. Experience with other gradients and possibly other pictures.


    Demo 2:
    -------

    1. Create a text caption.

    2. Blur it.

    3. Select a gradient.

    4. Apply a gradient map.

Fractal Explorer:
-----------------

The fractal explorer is a GIMP plug-in that can be used to render some
fractals.

    Demo:
    -----

    1. Create an empty image.

    2. Invoke the Fractal Explorer with
        <Image> -> Filters -> Render -> Pattern -> "Fractal Explorer..."

    3. Play with it. (the upper-left preview is zoomable)

Turning a photograph into a painting:
=====================================

One can use the GIMP to convert a photograph into something that resembles a
painting. If you have a special printer that will draw it for you on canvas,
you can use it to sell your "original" artworks and become filthy rich.

Well, not exactly, but there are still some very nice effects available.

Oilify:
-------

1. Open g_anwar1.jpg

2. Select <Image> -> Filters -> Artistic -> "Oilify..."

3. Select a mask size and press the OK Button.

4. Undo and Play with various settings.

Gimpressionist:
---------------

1. Open g_anwar1.jpg

2. Select <Image> -> Filters -> Artistic -> "Gimpressionist..."

3. Select a preset. and press the Apply button

4. Play with the settings in the different tabs if you don't like the preview.

5. Press the OK Button.

6. Undo and do it with other images and/or settings.



Scripting the GIMP:
===================

The GIMP has an extensive support for scripting, due to the fact that it
was designed from the ground up to be modular and extensible. There are
several components available to the one that wish to script it and they will
be covered in the next slides.

The GIMP's programmability can be used to repeat repetetive tasks and to
implement your own effects. Thus, for example, one can generate web-page
themes.

The Gimp's Procedural Database (PDB):
-------------------------------------

Gimp contains a database of named procedures. The name of each procedure can
contain alphanumeric characters as well as underscores (which are translated
to minus signs in Scheme). The list is flat so care must be taken to maintain
namespace integrity.

One can see the current list of available procedures by accessing
<Toolbox> -> Xtns -> "DB Browser...". As is apparent by browsing it there are
several classes of functions:

1. Those that are implmented internally inside the GIMP.

2. Those that were registered by the plug-ins and implemented by them. By
writing your own plug-ins (in C) you can create such functions
of your own.

3. Those that are written in Scheme (begin with script-fu).

4. Those that are written in Perl (those can possibly be unavailable).

Script-Fu (Scheme) Scripting:
-----------------------------

Script-Fu is a GIMP extension that enables to write PDB functions and
implement menu entries in Scheme. The Scheme scripts reside in
~/.gimp-1.2/scripts and whenever changed they need to be refreshed by
selecting <Toolbox> -> Xtns -> Script-Fu -> Refresh.

Beside that, GIMP sports an interactive Script-Fu Console. It can be invoked
by selecting <Toolbox> -> Xtns -> Script-Fu -> Console.

    Demo:
    -----

    1. Invoke the console.

    2. Close all the images.

    3. Create a new image with the background as its filling.

    4. At the commmand prompt of the console, type (gimp-image-list) and
        press enter and record the index of the image. (It's inside
        the inner parenthesis).

    5. Type (gimp-image-active-drawable $image) and record the drawable number.
        (In the GIMP internals, a drawable is a base class for layers and such)

    6. Type (gimp-rect-select $image 10 10 50 80 ADD 0 0)

    7. Type (gimp-rect-select $image 40 70 50 80 ADD 0 0)

    8. Type (gimp-bucket-fill $drawable FG-BUCKET-FILL NORMAL 100 0 0 0 0)

        Note: consult the database browser for information regarding what every
        function here does.

Now let's see some of the Scheme scripts in action:

1. Select <Toolbox> -> Xtns -> Script-Fu -> Logos -> "Bovination..."

2. Press the button next to "Font:" in the dialog that appears and select a
nice scalable font.

3. Press OK.

4. And you have a full-fledged logo.

One can see the source code for this script in
/usr/share/gimp/1.2/scripts/bovinated-logo.scm (replace /usr with your
GIMP installation path and 1.2 with your gimp's major version). You can view
it with gvim or something similar to display it nicely.

* As can be seen the script is mostly linear and it performs
    various operations one after the other. Don't ask me what's going on
    there and how the effect is made exactly (I didn't write that script),
    but if one is experienced enough he or she should be able to create
    similar effects and place them inside such scripts.

You can play with the other scripts in the Xtns -> Script-Fu -> Logos menu
and view their source code. (my personal favourite is Frosty, which is quite
heavy on CPU and time).

An important problem with Script-Fu is debugging. While one can write and
execute entire scripts as a whole, and execute individual commands on the
command-line, there isn't an interactive debugger for Script-Fu. Also,
Script-Fu uses a reduced version of SIOD as its Scheme back-end, which makes
the standard "printf()ing" approach problematic too, as it is quite limited in
functionality.

Gimp-Perl Scripting
-------------------

Gimp-Perl scripts are treated as plug-ins by the GIMP and are placed in the
plug-ins directory. They work by using libgimp to communicate with the GIMP.
Gimp-Perl (a.k.a Perl-Fu) also sports a TCP/IP server that can be used to run
and debug such scripts from a shell prompt. And naturally, since this is
perl, one can do everything perl does (from files to sockets to fork()ing).

Gimp-Perl has the disadvantage of being less portable as it depends on
Perl/Gtk+ being present. And Perl/Gtk+, at the time of writing, is not
available for Win32.

Gimp-Perl scripts are similar in spirit to their Scheme equivalents except for
the standard nuances of the different syntax. (note that where one would write
"(gimp-foo-function myvar othervar)" in Script-Fu, he should
write "gimp_foo_function($myvar, $othervar);" in perl.)

Gimp-Perl has an optional extension called Gimp::Pixel that enables to pass
data to and from PDL. PDL stands for the Perl Data Language and is a
Matlab-like extension to perl. By using PDL one can manipulate GIMP
images using mathematical tools in a manner that is usually much faster
to write than C, and equally as fast to execute.

Furthermore, because Gimp-Perl uses Perl/Gtk+ those scripts can present
interactive GUI dialogs to the user.

Note that not all Gimp installations support Perl/Gtk+ in order to not make
it dependant on Perl and Perl/Gtk+. Thus, it is possible that you'll need to
recompile the GIMP to enable it.

    Demo (?)

Plug-ins and other options:
---------------------------

If all else fail, you can write a C plug-in to the GIMP. There's some
documentation on the web for it:

http://gimp-plug-ins.sourceforge.net/

Because Plug-Ins are given access to the GIMP's PDB, Plug-ins can invoke
other plug-ins, so don't worry about modularity.

Except for that, it seems that there is also Gimp-Python, Gimp-Guile and
Gimp-Tcl.
None of them seems too much alive, but one can try using them at his own
risk.

Finale:
=======

This lecture only covered the tip of the iceberg of what can be done with the
GIMP. To see more, you'll need to consult the resources I linked to, or
experience on your own with the GIMP.

I hope you enjoyed the lecture. If you have any other questions or comments
, then please address me in person or send a message to the Club's mailing list.

Happy Gimping and may the Wilber (that's the GIMP's maskot) be with you!
