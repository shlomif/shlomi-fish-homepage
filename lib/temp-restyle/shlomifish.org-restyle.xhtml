<h1>Shlomi Fish's Humorous Creations</h1>
<p>
I very much enjoy humorous things and like to laugh or be amused a lot.
Since I was 19 years old, I've also been creating my own funny pieces,
and decided to put them on this web-site for everybody to see. I hope
you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoyed writing them, and still
enjoy thinking about them.
And if you're someone who likes to play <a
href="http://www.pokerstars.com/">poker</a> a lot, I hope you can still spend
some time with these funny pieces. Who knows? You might get a kick out of it
too.
</p>
<h2 id="large-scale">Large-scale Creations</h2>
<h3 id="the-enemy-series">"The Enemy" Series</h3>
<div style="margin-left : 3em">
<p>
This is a series of stories telling the whereabouts of the ex-Member of the
Organization.
</p>
<h4 id="the-enemy"><a href="./TheEnemy/">The Enemy and How I Helped to Fight it</a></h4>
<p>
A political satire about the situation that prevailed in the Israeli-Lebanese
border. Lots of exits about mathematical logic, and a general critique of the
irrationality guiding political bodies.
</p>
<h4 id="road-to-heaven"><a href="./RoadToHeaven/">The Road to Heaven is Paved with Bad Intentions</a></h4>
<p>
The sequel to "The Enemy". The ex-Member travels back in time and tries to
prevent World War II.
</p>
</div>
<h3 id="one-with-fountainhead"><a href="./TOWTF/">The One with the Fountainhead</a></h3>
<p>
A two-part episode of Friends that parodies the book "The Fountainhead" by
Ayn Rand. Note that I received input from one person who is not familiar with
the show, yet enjoyed this work very much.
</p>
<h3 id="pope-died-on-sunday"><a href="./Pope/">The Pope Died on Sunday</a></h3>
<p>
A description of an insane week in the life of a female American
graphic artist. A typical Holywoodian story with not so Hoywoodian elements.
Work under progress, and available only in Hebrew for the time being.
</p>
<h3 id="humanity"><a href="./humanity/">Humanity</a></h3>
<p>
A parody about humanity and modern life in particular. Humanity describes
a day in the life of a Semitic city circa 500 B.C. Work under progress.
</p>
<h3 id="human-hacking-field-guide"><a href="./human-hacking/">The Human Hacking Field Guide</a></h3>
<p>
A teen-story (sort-of), but one that will appeal to grown-ups as well. Also
may serve as propaganda for getting more youngsters involved in programming
and engineering.
</p>
<h3 id="we-the-living-dead"><a href="./Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">Star Trek: "We the Living
Dead"</a></h3>
<p>
My own invented episode of the new crop of Star Trek series. In this episode
we discover the true essence of the Q Continuum, and some "Living Dead":
conscious beings (including humans) who reportedly died, but actually
were saved and still live a prosperous life elsewhere.
</p>
<h2 id="small-scale">Small-scale Creations</h2>
<h3 id="quotes-collection"><a href="../humour.html">Collection of My Quotes and Aphorisms</a></h3>

throughout the years.

<p>
A collection of files for the UNIX fortune program (that can also be read with
a naked eye) that consist of several collections of funny or enlightening
quotes.
</p>
<h3 id="way-to-do-it"><a href="ways_to_do_it.html">Ways to Do It According to the Programming Languages of the World</a></h3>
<p>
Take the Perl motto ("There's more than one way to do it") and extrapolate it
to the other programming languages out there.

    <h2>About this site</h2>
    <div class="inner">
<p>
This is the personal site of <a href="personal.html"><b>Shlomi Fish</b></a>. I
am an Israeli software developer, and writer of stories, articles, essays and
presentations.
</p>
<p>
You can explore the site using the <a href="#navbar"><b>navigation bar</b></a>
to the
left. Alternatively, you can traverse it page by page using the <b>arrows at
the top</b>. Alternatively see <a href="#news">this site's <b>news feed</b></a>
for what's new here.
</p>
<p>
Here are some of the things you can find here:
</p>
<h3 id="humour"><a href="humour/">Humour</a></h3>
<p>
I enjoy writing <a href="./humour/stories">large-scope humorous
stories</a> (novellas). My first and favourite one was
<a href="./humour/TheEnemy/">"The Enemy"</a>, which is a political
satire, inspired by mid-eastern politics, but with a more universal
message. I also wrote <a href="./humour/TOWTF/">"The One with the
Fountainhead"</a>, which is my funniest piece yet, and
<a href="./humour/human-hacking/">"The Human
Hacking Field Guide"</a>, which is a not-so-realistic realism about
open-source enthuisastic teenagers, but with many jokes.
</p>
<p>
I have other unfinished stories.
</p>
<p>
I have also written many <a href="humour/bits/">shorter bits</a> and
maintain
<a href="humour/fortunes/">a large collection of fortune cookies</a> by
myself and others.
</p>
<h3 id="philosophy"><a href="philosophy/">Articles and Essays</a></h3>
<p>
I am <a href="philosophy/politics/define-zionism/">a Jew and an Israeli</a>
by nationality, an atheist by faith, and <a
href="philosophy/philosophy/guide-to-neo-tech/">a "Neo-Tech"
Objectivist</a> by ideology. (Objectivism
<a href="./humour/fortunes/shlomif-fav.html#neo-tech-selfishness">does
not imply selfishness</a>, by the way, but rather "Rational Self-Growth".)
My expertise as a software developer (in many fields), and my interest
in philosophy, history, software management, and other fields also contribute
to my essays and articles.
</p>
<h3 id="open-source"><a href="open-source/">Open Source Software</a></h3>
<p>
Links to software I wrote, and some resources with links to other software.
Knock yourself out!
</p>
<h3 id="presentations"><a href="lecture/">Presentations</a></h3>
<p>
I prepared several technical presentations. Especially recommended is the
<a href="lecture/Perl/Newbies/">"Perl for Newbies" series</a>
introducing <a href="http://perl-begin.org/">the Perl programming
language</a> to absolute beginners.
</p>
<h3 id="links"><a href="links.html">Links</a></h3>
<p>
There are many links on the site, but I also concentrated many of them in
one place. Who doesn't like links?
</p>
<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
<p>
I hope you enjoy my web-site. If you do, please
<a href="./meta/how-to-help/">link here</a> or recommend
it to your friends.
