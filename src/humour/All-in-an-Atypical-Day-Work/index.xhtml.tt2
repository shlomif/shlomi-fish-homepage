<p>
<b>Update:</b> I have now written <a href="https://pypi.org/project/rebookmaker/">rebookmaker</a>
which is a mostly compatible reimplementation of ebookmaker, and which is under
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT / Expat licence</a>
since ebookmaker lacks an explicit licence, and am using it instead of ebookmaker.
<a href="https://github.com/shlomif/screenplays-common">Git repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
Ebookmaker is a Python 3 script that allows one to generate an EPUB and was
used for preparing <a href="#ebook">the Selina Mandrake E-book</a>. While
not perfect, it proved extremely useful and
<a href="http://github.com/setanta">the author</a> (= Marcelo Lira
a.k.a “setanta”) also promptly
merged <a href="https://github.com/setanta/ebookmaker/pull/1">a
pull request</a> I sent him. Thanks, Marcelo, for your great work!
