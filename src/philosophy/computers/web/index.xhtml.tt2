Revision 2, published in 2009, with many updates, and corrections:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It’s amazing how much has changed since I’ve published this article
a few years ago. The most important trend was probably that personal blogs
seem to have become much more prevalent than personal web-sites up to
the point that some people referred to www.shlomifish.org as a blog. I have
been annoyed at this to some extent, and even wrote
<a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/computers/web/homepage-vs-blog/">an entire
essay about the distinction between a home page and a blog</a> and why
this homepage is not a blog.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, as <a href="[% base_path %]me/blogs/">an
active blogger</a>, it’s not that I hate blogs or try to underrate them -
it’s just that I think that I invest more effort and rigour in writing
articles or essays on my home page, than I do on the various random stuff
I post to my blogs. (Or to other similar public channels, such as mailing
lists, web forums, comments on other people’s blogs, etc.). I also feel that
it is easier to find posts on my personal web-site than on most people’s
blogs.
