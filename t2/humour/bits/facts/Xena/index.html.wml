<h2 id="facts">The Facts</h2>

<ul>

<li>
Xena can meet King David for breakfast and Julius Caesar for lunch. Without
time travel.
</li>

<li>
Xena beat a Goliath that was taller, and more agile than the one in the Bible.
It’s not only Hollywood exaggeration.
</li>

<li>
No one calls Xena the warrior princess “Zeena” to her face and survives.
Luckily for you she hasn’t visited modern-day U.S. yet.
</li>

<li>
Xena can throw a boomerang-like weapon thingy in the opposite direction and
it will still hit the mark while neutralising 10 of her enemies.
</li>

<li>
Xena the Warrior Princess has not met Chuck Norris yet, or otherwise he
would have been badly and permanently injured.
