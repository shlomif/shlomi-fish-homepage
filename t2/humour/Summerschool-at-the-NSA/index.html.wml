<latemp_subject "Summerschool at the NSA - A Screenplay" />
<latemp_meta_desc "Two Hollywood actresses conspire to kick the ass of the NSA, using special warfare that is completely non-violent and non-destructive, bringing an old Internet meme to life. Set in the Spring of 2013." />

<summerschool_at_the_nsa_common_top_elems />

<p>
This informal screenplay (which was not produced or filmed yet) is surrealist
realism, and takes place in the spring-summer of 2013. It is far-fetched, but
could actually happen.

I also consider <i>Summerschool at the NSA</i> to be a 2013 modernisation of
<i>Atlas Shrugged</i>.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> while considering myself a mostly Objectivist, and while I enjoyed
reading <i>The Fountainhead</i> and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>, I reject
Classical Randianism as unfitting for 2013 and forward, and
<a href="$(ROOT)/humour/stories/">my other stories</a> and more serious
