<saying who="joeyadams">lol.  Zuu&#39;s probabilistic, so maybe he can solve you.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">but i guess i have now</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Formal definition of Turing hard:  blah blah blah hard blah blah Turing blah.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">Hahahaha :D</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Wikipedia:   Given a set X in P(N), a set A in N is called Turing hard for X if X &lt;=_T A for all X in X. If additionally A is in X, then A is called Turing complete for X.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Does that clarify?</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_reduction for the actual math symbols)</saying>
<me_is who="joeyadams">assumes you get the point</me_is>
<saying who="Zuu">yeah, i think i&#39;ll have to put significant time into that, for me to comprehend it :)</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">but maybe i will, some day :P</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">My point is that people like to use mumbo jumbo to describe more concise mumbo jumbo.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">E.g. A problem is NP-hard if it is at least as hard as all the problems in NP.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">i understand enough of it, to be fairly confident that rindolf being turing hard, will not say much about his ability to be solved</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">I&#39;m guessing Turing-hard means you can&#39;t solve a problem with a Turing machine (e.g. the halting problem)</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">(substitute Turing machine with &quot;your computer&quot; :) )</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">no, turing hard has something to do with expressiveness</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">okay, Zuu &gt; joeyadams, so I can&#39;t help you :)</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">tickles joeyadams ^^</me_is>
<saying who="joeyadams">A delicious apple is any fruit ∈ apple that is at least as tasty as any other fruit ∈ apple.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">In other words, apples are in the set of recursively nommable fruits.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">joeyadams: what&#39;s up?</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">I&#39;m babbling.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">joeyadams: Apple is one of my least favourite fruits.</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">watches a number of apples that recursively NOM&#39;s each other</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">It tends to be too commonplace.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Or simpleton.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">whoops, my logic is incorrect</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Only delicious apples are ∈ the nommable fruits.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">(recursively is just a word you throw in to sound smart)</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">NOMs joeyadams :&gt;</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">joeyadams: a friend of one of my sisters said that Apple is his favourite fruit.</saying>

<me_is who="joeyadams">has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection nommed by peer))</me_is>
<saying who="Zuu">yeah, unfortunately a lot of people throw with a lot of words to sound smart :/</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">my favourite fruit is a recursive banana!</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">although it certainly helps to use complex terminology to solve complex problems.  As Aristophanes said, &quot;High thoughts must have high language.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">.. along with immutable polymorphic pears</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Zuu&gt; I guess you have to peel it indefinitely?</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">lol</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">Hahah, yeah :P</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">I tend to eat bananas in deterministic polynomial time.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">i eat them in linear time, but uses exponential space</saying>

<saying who="Zuu">Hi rindolf :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Hi Zuu </saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: I&#39;ve been thinking that maybe you can find some corresponding Zuus of the appropriate sex in a different dimension.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">hmmm... interesting!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: are you a heterosexual Zuu or a homosexual one?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">I'm not sure what sex I am.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">:P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: you can look.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: in the mirror or something.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: don&#39;t you have obligatory genders in Danish/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Like in German, French, etc.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Or Hebrew and Arabic.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">obligatory genders?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">you mean, the genders in linguistics?</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">never understood those</me_is>
<saying who="Zuu">but Danish have two i believe, and if i remember correctly there is female and &#39;none&#39;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: yes, genders in linguistics.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">i don't remember what which is which though :P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Like in Hebrew &quot;Haben Halakh lagan&quot; - the boy went to the garden. &quot;Habath Halkha lagan&quot; - &quot;The girl went to the garden&quot;</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">That almost sounds like allah akbar</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">rindolf, no we don't distinct between the genders of the subject in the danish language</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">our nouns have genders though</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">zuu-nina?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">like &#39;house&#39; is one gender and &#39;car&#39; is another</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: of course the question is - what language do Zuus speak natively?</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">rindolf: Of course, Zuu speaks Zuu!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuuish?</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">The Zulu population also does not speak Zuluish, just Zulu.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">so if you want to say &#39;the house&#39; its &#39;huse_t_&#39; and if you want to say &#39;the car&#39; its &#39;bile_n_&#39;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">c_sphere: Arnavoth (sounds like an Aztec god) is &quot;Hares&quot; (the Rabbit-like mammal) in Hebrew.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: can you understand Swedish?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">rindolf, some :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">swedish branched from danish AFAIK</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">same with norwegian</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">yes, Zuu&#39;s speak Zuuish natively :P</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">is listening to Hans Zimmer - Jack Sparrow</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">Zuuish has few words, all of which is based on words about cake from other languages :P</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">c_sphere, are you by any chance related to s_cube ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: ah, what do you use the Hebrew word &quot;עוגיה&quot; (= `ugiyah, cookie) for?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">&quot;Chocolate chip pie crust marmalade marzipan cookie yum yum!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">i use it for cookies baked from a hebrew recipe :P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">What does it mean in Zuuish?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">it&#39;s hard to really say something in Zuuish... al you can really do is say something equivalent to &quot;COOKIES!!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">or &quot;YAY CAKE!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">basically, you can only express excitement over different kinds of cakes :P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: do Zuus eat anything except cakes or cookies?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">There was this one time...</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">wait.. no. That was someone else.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Chekov: he seems to imply you should wait until computers are fast enough.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Problem is people don&#39;t want to upgrade and if a competing program (maybe a fork ) is much faster, then some of them will switch.</saying>

<saying who="oilio">yeah, I read about it in the wikipedia</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">oilio: and you can lookup a value based on a key efficiently.</saying>
<saying who="arubin">Linear search is good enough for everyone.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">marzy: Emacs is not a better vim. They are very different.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">marzy: I could never get used to Emacs, but have used Vim for many years.</saying>
<saying who="marzy">rindolf Emacs + Evil mode makes a better vim</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">marzy: does it support all Vim extensions?</saying>
<saying who="marzy">no, that&#39;s why its better. it doesn&#39;t come with retarded scripting language!!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">marzy: well, it&#39;s still not 100% compatible with vim.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">marzy: and Evil is an awful name. Sorry.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">&quot;The only thing more evil than XSLT is XSLT edited with Emacs Evil mode.&quot; ;-)</saying>
<saying who="marzy">i think it&#39;s a good name considering emacs and vi(m) rivalry</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">marzy: of course, I&#39;ve heard worse - coq and coccinelle.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And then there&#39;s this guy here who called his programming language Flua which reminds me of Flu and Influenza.</saying>
<saying who="Reactionary">rindolf: lol</saying>
<saying who="dardevelin">rindolf, flua IDE is not that bad to be fair (at least the little i tried )</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dardevelin: didn&#39;t say *it* was bad - I said the name was bad.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dardevelin: and I could never get it running here. Problems with Py3 and PyQt.</saying>
<saying who="dardevelin">rindolf, oh that sucks... :/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dardevelin: yes.</saying>
<saying who="dardevelin">rindolf, yeah i know you didn&#39;t said it was bad, just as gave you my opinion on it as a side note. sorry i should have made it more explicit :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Of course, Evil is not as bad a name as SLIME, which is another Emacs mode.</saying>
<saying who="dardevelin">rindolf, i had troubles with SLIME once and boy i got tired of fighting with it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Reportedly it was also the nickname of an internal Microsoft version control system called SLM (that is now largely discontinued).</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">codescience: it stands against the open source definition.</saying>
<saying who="ssta">codescience: that would violate the spirit of what most people understand &quot;open source&quot; to mean</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">codescience: people can sell copies of open source software or services related to it.</saying>
<saying who="codescience">hmmm, i understand</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">codescience: see http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html</saying>
<saying who="ssta">I can legally sell you this copy of the Linux kernel...I can charge whatever you are willing to pay.  Nothing in the license prevents this</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: will you sell it to me for 5,000 USD?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">;-)</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: sure</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: how about for 3,000 USD?</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: tell you what, for $10,000 I&#39;ll throw in a free copy of FreeBSD</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: wow, sounds like a good deal.</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: hmm, 3000 is a bit low, I don&#39;t think I could go that cheap</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: how much are you selling the source code of Apache 2.4 for?</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: oh, you can have that for free</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: really?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Sucker!</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: sure...but the build scripts you have to pay for</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: would you be willing to exchange the source of the Linux kernel for three copies of jQuery? I will even throw in a few free Dojo plugins.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: he already told us.</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: hmm, not sure I want jQuery</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: would you happen to have code for a halfway decent RDBMS?  I think I could swap for that</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: I have the source code for MySQL. Not sure if it&#39;s half-decent.</saying>
<saying who="codescience">i run a mysql server. runs good enough for me</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: I use MySQL in production quite a lot.  It has its flaws, but my use cases never seem to hit them</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: so will you exchange its source code for the Linux kernel?</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: sure</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: sounds good.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: you can find the source code of MySQL here - http://www.mysql.com/</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Jude: quite encouraging.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">why</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: what is encouraging?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I mean that some television producers are having a clue about piracy.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I think the MPAA is likely going to follow the lead of the RIAA and endorse the Internet.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: well, there&#39;s still a long way to go with even music online.</saying>
<saying who="cheeseduck">rindolf: &quot;How to win friends and...&quot;</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">One episode involved a lot of songs, which I disliked.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: heh, LOL.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude++</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: it&#39;s directed at little girls.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: so it&#39;s a pretty clean show.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">yeah I know</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I was kidding</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: if you want incest and violence, then look no further than the Jewish bible.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">there are a lot of dubbing sections of the show to go with metal songs or violent scripts etc</saying>
<saying who="Jude">rindolf, I&#39;m jewish</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: reportedly, it was quite realism then (the Bible I mean).</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: ah, nice. So am I.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">and I couldn&#39;t agree more</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I have to go watch game of thrones</saying>

<saying who="Jude">I know</saying>
<saying who="Jude">there are plenty of them</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: ah, that&#39;s great.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I take them to uni on a daily basis</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I live right by Rabin sq.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: so you study in TAU?</saying>
<saying who="Jude">yeah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: TAU has tons of hot chicks.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">there are some</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: there aren&#39;t a lot of people on the streets of Gimmel.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: so you study CS?</saying>
<saying who="Jude">no way</saying>
<saying who="Jude">maths</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: ah, I see.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: maths...</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I know one or two nice looking girls, but I usually get put off by their personalities</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I think maths is taught wrong in several aspects.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I&#39;ve only been attracted to one specimen of the female sex ever</saying>
<saying who="Jude">in my entire life</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: ah, really?</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I dunno, I agree when you speak of high school maths</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I like university maths so far</saying>
<saying who="Jude">my professors are really nice</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: well, there are a lot of girls studying more humane stuff.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: http://blogs.perl.org/users/shlomi_fish/2013/03/ann-my-transition-from-software-developer-to-writerentertaineramateur-philosopherinternet-celebrity.html</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I generally don&#39;t like people who study humane subjects (I don&#39;t consider philosophy to be as such though)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I&#39;ve made a transition from a mathematician to a software developer and now I&#39;m more of a writer/entertainer/amateur-philosopher.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">you didn&#39;t like the way it was taught?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: like which way?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: you mean maths?</saying>
<saying who="Jude">yes</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: well: 1. No pairwise work. Big mistake.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">2. Need to memorise a lot of silly stuff. Why??</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">3. Maybe allow some sloppiness. Make maths more humane.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">that&#39;s why you got philosophy</saying>
<saying who="Jude">maths can&#39;t afford to be sloppy</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">There&#39;s something poetical about many maths&#39; proofs.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">the intuitive ideas behind them</saying>
<saying who="Jude">are beautiful</saying>
<saying who="Jude">but intuition can be misleading</saying>
<saying who="Jude">that&#39;s why you have to be really strict</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: yes, that&#39;s why I think we should now move into proof verifier realm.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">if you want your proof to be valid</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: right.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: but I was once criticised for this - http://ladypine.livejournal.com/24574.html</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: thing is - not everything should be strict when teaching.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I agree that mathematical intuition can be misleading, but it&#39;s still a good thing to have.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: thing is I think many mathematicians now require a lot of dedication and selling their soul to the devil, which is turning them into http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Nemo -s.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">it&#39;s not a very formal proof</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: when I studied EE most of my courses were with open material, and I could do pairwise work, which I enjoyed.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">but seems to hold</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: yes.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I guess you are right</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: :-D</saying>
<saying who="Jude">that the concept is more important than the formalization</saying>
<saying who="Jude">but a lot of my professors agree with you</saying>
<saying who="Jude">and would give much more attention to grasping the important concept, and understanding intuition behind proofs</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I&#39;m always right. Unless I claim that &quot;A is not-A&quot;. But Chuck Norris would be right even then.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">lol</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Hah! A new Chuck Norris factoid.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">&lt;3</saying>
<saying who="Jude">it&#39;s been nice chatting with you, I really have to go now, I need to watch GoT and then go to bed and wake up in 4 hours</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: my father and I now have an ongoing Chuck Norris meme.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: bye, have fun, and good night.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">rindolf, what&#39;s that</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: what?</saying>
<saying who="Jude">the Chuck Norris meme</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: well, we say stuff like &quot;you&#39;re my most Chuck Norris dad.&quot; or &quot;I taught Chuck Norris how to fight.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">It&#39;s a personal running joke.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, a family-wide one.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">We have our own jargon.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">heh</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Most families do.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I&#39;m not close enough to any member of my family</saying>
<saying who="Jude">to do that</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Ah.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">talk to you later, ciao</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Bye.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">rindolf: Douglas Hofstadter gave a talk about how mathematicians aren&#39;t as rigorous as they claim to be</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">and that they use a lot of analogical thinking</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: ah, OK.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">it was at the university of Toronto</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">I missed it sadly though</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: was it filmed?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">but I can basically tell you what he said more or less</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">rindolf: there was a webcast</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">not sure if it can be accessed still</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">&lt;+Nisstyre-laptop&gt; but if you read either GEB or I Am a Strange Loop you&#39;ll get it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: I read GEB.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: GEB was a nice book, but I knew a lot of what he was saying there.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: I still enjoyed the drama stuff in the middle with Achilles, the Tortoise and their friends.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">rindolf: you had the idea of using PM as a metaphor for systems of thinking and the mind?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">because that&#39;s what the book is about</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: PM?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">Principia Mathematica</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">the formal system constructed by Russell and Whitehead</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: I didn&#39;t think of it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: yes, I know.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">the entire book is his theory of consciousness</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">and how there are levels of thinking</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: well, I read &quot;I think, therefore I laugh&quot; before I read GEB.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">you can be less of a thinking being, etc...</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Yes, he says that consciousness requires thinking in loops, or self-reflection.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, it&#39;s an informal theory of consciousness.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">it requires what he calls a strange loop</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">and there can be many levels to it</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">more levels == what we think of as more human or more conscious beings</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">so PM actually is able to self reflect to an extent</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">although it requires a human to interpret it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I believe, that creating artificial intelligence/artificial consciousness won&#39;t be easy to do, will require a lot of complex code, and will likely be faulty (have its own will, make mistakes, not run as quickly as more specialised code, etc.).</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: yes.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">depends what you mean by AI</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">there are several different definitions</saying>
<saying who="gde33">the first human like robot will be build in Japan, the first artificial intelligence in the US</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">heh</saying>
<saying who="gde33">hahaha</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">the church-turing hypothesis would seem to imply it&#39;s possible, at least in principle</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">to create &quot;strong&quot; AI</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">although I intensely dislike that term</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">since it tries to say that any system of thinking that doesn&#39;t work exactly the same as a human one isn&#39;t AI</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">which is BS</saying>
<saying who="gde33">you guys are all worried about intelligence, I think that will be the easy part. Then comes the important stuff: giving it a sense of humor.</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">so there was the idea that consciousness is associated with information flow, and that &quot;more&quot; information flow is &quot;More&quot; consciousness, a continuum like gravity... but gravity can produce a qualitatively different effect past a certain level (black holes..)</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">so the &quot;loop&quot; is where information flow becomes qualitatively different ?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">doomlord: have you read GEB?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">it would be the ability a system has to observe itself, and encode the system itself in the system</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">in other words self reflection</saying>
<saying who="gde33">I don&#39;t know many people who can be truly accused of having their own thoughts</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">i don't think so but i have some related quotes from somewhere</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">but can a system only approximate itself</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">Principia Mathematica has that ability</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">can a computer emulate itself...</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">as Gödel showed</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">you can encode formulas in PM as formulas in PM</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">doomlord: yes</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">but to what practical extent</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">what is that supposed to mean?</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">nature has many &#39;feedback loops&#39; involving information</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">physical limitations result in a hard limit of feedback loops</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">what's GEB, links?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">if you point a camera at a mirror eventually it will &quot;stop&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">doomlord: it&#39;s a book</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">Gödel, Escher, Bach</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">ah Google reveals</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">but the sequel is more clear on what it&#39;s about</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">I Am A Strange Loop</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">OK sounds interesting</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">doomlord: anyway, if you nest implementations of a computer in a computer eventually there will be a limit imposed by the physical situation</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">i.e. the memory and processor speed</saying>
<saying who="gde33">only for limited thinkers</saying>
<saying who="gde33">it&#39;s like entropy, only for people who are afraid to think :P</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">but don't physical systems also have practical limitations</saying>
<saying who="gde33">yes but those are not what we imagine them to be</saying>
<saying who="gde33">if only we knew the meaning of life, that would make things so much easier</saying>
<saying who="Stryyker">how?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I think the whole &quot;AIs spawning AIs&quot; dream is not a good strategy for doing software dev. I think programming is here to stay. It&#39;s not like humans can efficiently do what a dedicated polynomial time program can.</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">even humans get programmed, lol</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">doomlord: yes.</saying>
<saying who="gde33">that new immortality project had some interesting videos</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">doomlord: a large part of human technology is mental.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">doomlord: in fact, we can no longer survive without our mental technology. We couldn&#39;t for thousands of years.</saying>
<saying who="gde33">oh but we can</saying>
<saying who="gde33">just need a favorable environment</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">cultural template = human OS</saying>
<saying who="gde33">not mine</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gde33: you can survive without your mental technology? Even without conceptual thought?</saying>
<saying who="gde33">not sure what you mean</saying>
<saying who="gde33">isn&#39;t that what all the other species do?</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">i saw some TED talk trying to explain the difference between Chinese and western spending/saving habits in the way the language encourages people to think about time</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">supposedly Chinese language makes it harder to think of past, present, future separately</saying>
<saying who="gde33">languages can be really weird</saying>
<saying who="gde33">all languages have the word &quot;argument&quot; but some want it to have additional meanings, I believe in China an argument is equal to disobedience. lol</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">huh?</saying>
<saying who="gde33">in English it is a kind of fight</saying>
<saying who="gde33">争 is a dispute 争论 is an argument or debate</saying>
<saying who="gde33">I cant think of good examples, I used to know a girl who knew many languages</saying>
<saying who="gde33">she showed me how some things are badly broken in some languages</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">is it true Japanese can&#39;t say &quot;no&quot;, they have to repeat the question in negative..</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">that is what we were told when learning but they must have a word for no surely</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">doomlord: there is &quot;Hai&quot; for Yes and &quot;iie&quot; for no</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">so its just impolite to say &quot;no&quot; i guess</saying>
<me_is who="Belxjander">is living in Japan</me_is>
<saying who="Belxjander">doomlord: you lose context...</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">doomlord: in English you don&#39;t repeat</saying>
<saying who="gde33">hah no</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">but in Japanese you do</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">gde33: depends on the person... my mother and father thought nothing of explaining politeness to me and will happily talk overtop me when I am speaking</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gde33: I only know (Modern) Hebrew, English, some mostly forgotten Written Arabic, and some French (which I&#39;m now trying to regain).</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">I have also run into the same from Chinese, Japanese, American, European AND African people I have met</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gde33: well, I also know bits of other languages like Spanish, Russian, German, etc.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gde33: I know that in Hebrew we have compulsive genders for objects, so we don&#39;t care about phrasing sentences in a gender-neutral form, which is an English obsession.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gde33: I think it is parodied in this book - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinny_Legs_and_All_%28novel%29 (great one, BTW - taught me a lot).</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">heh languages with sexism built in.. gender all the way through</saying>
<saying who="gde33">some languages are also more emotional than others</saying>
<saying who="gde33">Italians are hilarious</saying>
<saying who="gde33">so much enthusiasm it makes you think something is going on</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">gde33: spoken or written and the correct manner for if you are addressing &quot;up/peer/down&quot; the social ladder with regards respect... yes</saying>
<saying who="gde33">Belxjander: does that apply to many words?</saying>

<saying who="cousteau">jamming all the time, having to remove an accordion-shaped paper each time</saying>
<saying who="cousteau">turns out there was another sheet jammed, but it was hidden and the printer wasn&#39;t detecting it</saying>
<saying who="pulse">i wonder if printers will still jam paper in the year 3000</saying>
<saying who="pulse">maybe it&#39;s a paradox of physics</saying>
<saying who="pulse">a fluke in nature</saying>
<saying who="`Gin">I think its more down to the fact printer companies have been milking their cash cow dry, £10 in R&amp;D each year. etc.</saying>
<saying who="pulse">maybe some day paper will become obsolete, then there will be no problem any more</saying>
<saying who="`Gin">There are still employees at my job who would prefer to print an email out, read it and then reply to the email.</saying>
<saying who="`Gin">I don&#39;t have much hope for that dream pulse :P</saying>

<saying who="cousteau">the machine rebellion will start with printers, it&#39;s a known fact</saying>
<saying who="koollman">I suppose the equivalent of paper jam with a 3d printer can get really messy</saying>
<saying who="cousteau">heh</saying>
<saying who="koollman">&quot;we cannot access the printer, it is inside a large blob of solidified plastic&quot;</saying>

<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: sorry, I meant that it&#39;s great that svn.php.net is up.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: haha ya. Pretty exciting, might write a short novella about it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">The Svniliion: The trials and tribulations of a programmers journey to get information about PHP</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">“The day when svn.php.net returned.” -- by olamachon</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: Ah that's it. So much better.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: Hopefully I&#39;ll get like a 10 sec clip in some svn documentary on the history channel</saying>
<saying who="XMPPwocky">rindolf: you *know* that the people working on svn.php had to have an offline backup</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: I like your title too.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: &quot;And it went down, and that is how I knew it was the beginning of the end&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="XMPPwocky">rindolf: because otherwise nobody could remember which way the arguments go for anything</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: “I sulked in my suffering. It was the kind of suffering that tore your heart to shreds. A programmer’s suffering. Nothing could equal it.”</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">XMPPwocky: ya I was thinking about asking my fellow ner... connoisseurs.... if they might have a backup</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: &quot;a lonely life full of 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: I smell the beginning of an organically grown IRC novel</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: this would definitely make a best-seller.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: maybe I&#39;ll prepare a convo log out of it - http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/sharp-programming.html</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">hahahah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: “I remembered the happy days when I was using the svn server back when it was at its prime. Running. Functioning. These days seem so distant now.”</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">LOL.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: &quot;Soon I realized we were at a turning point in a cultural revolution&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: hmm... you can do &quot;better&quot; than that.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/ - I actually wrote some novellas and screenplay-of-sorts here.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: right right, novellas. I was thinking more like I was the glue guy in a documentary</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: So I was trying to be super cliché</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: so was I.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: I like the ironic cliché where it actually means nothing</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: its just all good sounding filler</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">“I looked at the clock on my desktop. Each seconds seemed like a century. What will I do without the svn server online? What can I do? What can I do about it? Who am I asking all these questions?”</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: I wonder where I first read clichés such as that. Maybe it was someone parodying them.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: &quot;Then I had an existential epiphany. What is SVN? What am I? What are we doing in this universe? This foray into the metaphysical was cut short by a brief glance at the clock. It&#39;s 5 o&#39;clock. f**k this s**t, I&#39;m getting drunk.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: do you actually write?</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: never</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: ah, I see.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: is it that obvious? haha</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: you may be a natural.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: I wrote like an essay or two in university, they were like 2 pages haha</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: ah, so little?</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: I read a copious amount of literature</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: ah, OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: OK, I&#39;ll keep this conversation.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: Perhaps that has a prolific effect on my penchant for the perverse verbosity?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: and put it on that page.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: yes, maybe.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: Sure. I feel like we may be getting a bit off-topic here</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: yes, well, svn.php.net is back - that&#39;s what important.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Seize the svn.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Carpe svn!</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: Nice. I see what you did there. I am literally doing that as fast as I can</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, not sure the Latin is right.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">carpe is the seize part</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">&quot;Occupy svn.php.net!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">diem is day</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: yes, I know.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">But maybe svn has to be conjugated.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">oh was carpe diem an idiom?</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">carpe svnus?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Carpe svni?</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">^</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Carpe svna?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Carpe svnis?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Not sure.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">My Latin is weak.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I know the plural of Pentium is Pentia.</saying>
<saying who="pyon">olamachon: &quot;Carpe diem&quot; means something like &quot;live/enjoy this day&quot;</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">pyon: Seize the day</saying>
<saying who="pyon">Yeah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, carpe meant quite a few things.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">In Latin at least.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">This is unbelievably slow. On a 1gbps connection, PHP docs have been downloading for 15 minutes so far</saying>

<saying who="they">For instance, if you&#39;re making a library called &quot;Jail&quot;, have the top-level folder named &quot;Jail&quot;? So the namespaces below would be &quot;Jail.Whatever&quot;?</saying>

<me_is who="jrslepak">just names a project&#39;s directory based on the name of the project</me_is>

<saying who="rindolf">protist: I realised Sarah Michelle Gellar starred in the same show as Robin Williams. They played a father and daughter.</saying>
<saying who="protist">rindolf: you are obsessed with her :p</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And the father divorced her mother and left her mother to raise her on her own, kinda like SMG in real life.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">protist: I *iz* obsessed with her.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">protist: she was one of my first loves.</saying>
<saying who="protist">rindolf: haha</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">protist: I was recently obsessed with Jennifer Lawrence too - I like the alpha female/insurgent/antagonist/rebel type of girls.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">protist: over at the Technion , I kinda hit on a girl with a nose ring who coloured her hair  black, but she turned out to already have a bf.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">protist: since then I realised I should be more honest and direct and also reduce the round-trip/time-to-market delay.</saying>
<saying who="protist">rindolf: round-trip/time-to-market delay?</saying>
<saying who="protist">rindolf: and a lot of girls will just say they have a boyfriend :p...and sometimes they do it to test you, because oddly they are only interested in a guy who persists in spite of the fake boyfriend</saying>
<saying who="Jck_true">protist: Yeah you might not wanna mention ROI [= &quot;Return On Investment&quot;] when you&#39;re asking a girl on a date...</saying>
<saying who="protist">rindolf: but sometimes it is lack of interest...and sometimes they really do have a boyfriend</saying>
<saying who="protist">Jck_true: what do you mean? :p</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jck_true: heh.</saying>
<saying who="protist">Jck_true: I&#39;m doing the monogamy thing at the moment</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">&quot;What&#39;s your favourite position? CTO!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="pyon">protist: Wouldn&#39;t it be easier to simply say &quot;not interested, bye&quot;?</saying>
<saying who="pyon">protist: I mean, in the case where they aren&#39;t interested.</saying>
<saying who="protist">pyon: When do you ever remember girls being simple?</saying>
<saying who="Jck_true">The Freaking FCC :)</saying>
<saying who="pyon">protist: True that.</saying>
<saying who="protist">pyon: and sometimes they may tell you they have a boyfriend...and actually have one...but will still sleep with you</saying>
<saying who="protist">pyon: they might tell you just so you know that this is supposed to be discrete lol</saying>
<saying who="vendu">pyon, nothing is simple with/about women :D</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Svetlana: I hope you were not too offended by our sex talk or pseudo-sex talk here.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">We&#39;re not sexist - we just play ones in real life.</saying>
<saying who="HikaruBG">Svetlana, what is ffs?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, there&#39;s a difference between sexist and sexualised.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">HikaruBG: &quot;FFS = for fuck&#39;s sake&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="Svetlana">No, I&#39;m not offended at the conversation. I am offended at how lame work I&#39;m doing at setting focus and priorities, though.  I am trying to get mediawiki running but in fact I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a good idea for me to do so or what I would be working on.</saying>
<saying who="HikaruBG">thanks rindolf, i have learned something new today ....  that early in the morning :)</saying>
<saying who="HikaruBG">Svetlana, just take a 15 and step out from the office. Then figure all priorities out.</saying>
<saying who="Svetlana">How do you define &quot;take a 15&quot;?</saying>
<saying who="grim001">15 milliseconds</saying>

<saying who="HikaruBG">fresh air</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Svetlana: yes, maybe take a walk.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Svetlana: ah, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re not offended.</saying>
<saying who="HikaruBG">on another hand, Svetlana, where are you trying to deploy mediawiki?</saying>

            <title>Life According To Valentine</title>
        </meta>
        <irc>
            <body>
<saying who="rindolf">In my imagination, my concept at the time of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar , who was a relatively wild and polyamorous girl (but still an awesome one) decided to duplicate herself and then said &quot;I am going to call my new self &#39;Valentine&#39;&quot;. So she gets duplicated and her duplicate then says &quot;So I&#39;m Valentine, right?&quot;</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">does polyamorous mean a slut?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">njcomsec: well, not exactly.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">njcomsec: thing is - she was very picky about which guys she got involved with. But if she slept with you once, you don&#39;t need to worry about it happening again.</saying>
<saying who="pyon">Is it not possible to have a fixed, small but non-singleton set of romantic partners?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pyon: what does that mean?</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">i wouldn't worry about it :)</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">in fact i would worry she might NOT want to again</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">pyon i believe that is called open relationship</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">i am open to this idea</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">but so far i cant even find one nice girl who will date me</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">so this is the first step</saying>
<saying who="o0elise0o">i have this problem where if i sleep with someone i usually don't want to ever again</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">that's cute</saying>
<saying who="pyon">rindolf: A singleton set is a set with exactly one element. A small, non-singleton set of romantic partners would be, for example, having two or three romantic partners, but not having sex with arbitrary people.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Also , Miranda Kerr recently bragged about all the great sex she&#39;s been getting with various willing men after being separated from her husband (= Orlando Bloom). I say - all the power to her.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pyon: ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pyon: well, she had a fixed (But often growing or getting reduced) set of those.</saying>
<saying who="pyon">rindolf: Well... if it is often growing or shrinking, it is not fixed.</saying>
<saying who="gde33|2">o0elise0o: try costumes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJgYxWhDDWc</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pyon: ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pyon: well, if her lovers had entered a relationship, she stopped sleeping with them.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pyon: although not permanently.</saying>
<saying who="pyon">rindolf: Ah!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I imagined a short students&#39; film about Valentine Gellar&#39;s life.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">It starts with showing her riding a bus and then there are the immortal words &quot;I used to be Sarah Michelle Gellar&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And Valentine had a steady boyfriend and also studied for a Ph.D. Well, she&#39;s a professor now.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Anyway, at one point she visits her and Sarah&#39;s mother, who admits that while she knows that Valentine is technically her daughter, she causes her so few troubles and is so great, that she has a hard time thinking of her as her daughter - she&#39;s more like a younger friend.</saying>
<saying who="gde33|2">rindolf: you are spoiling the whole movie!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gde33|2: heh, it&#39;s not a real film.</saying>
<saying who="gde33|2">you underachiever!</saying>
<saying who="gde33|2">I say, make it so</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And then she visits a guy and sees that his room is in disarray and after she queries him for this he says &quot;Ah, yes, Sarah was here last night. We had an awesome time.&quot; So Valentine says: &quot;She couldn&#39;t have been! She stayed up late at a benefit and went to bed past 1 AM exhausted.&quot; . So he thinks for a moment and says: &quot;So it wasn&#39;t her! No biggie.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="KAROLINA">rindolf: are you fluffy?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">KAROLINA: no, I&#39;m Fluttershy.</saying>
<saying who="KAROLINA">rindolf: What is a fluffershy?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And there&#39;s also a part where the original SMG and Valentine recall some memories from their mutual past together.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">His owner was also very friendly.</saying>
<saying who="ezrios">a super-calm Rambo eh</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">ezrios: yes , amazing.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ezrios: Rambo was the epitome of a tough all powerful super-muscular anti-geeky warrior/action-hero.</saying>

<saying who="thecha">OK i will try</saying>
<saying who="thecha">the dog probably ws being aggressive because the owners mood was affecting him</saying>
<saying who="thecha">the owner probably was being hostile so the dog followed suit</saying>
<saying who="thecha">and the guy with the kids should have just said the names instead of being a dick about it</saying>
<saying who="thecha">you go for walks often?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">thecha: yes, I go for walks a lot.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">thecha: yes, this father should learn some things after fatherhood.</saying>

<saying who="xeno">I wish Adventure games (the old style) hadn&#39;t crashed so badly. I like the Telltale Games, but they&#39;ve turned into movies rather than click &amp; point games</saying>
<saying who="xeno">although I just got Broken Sword on my ipad, that seems promising</saying>
<saying who="xeno">but still not anywhere near Lucasarts</saying>
<saying who="xeno">imagine the old Lucasarts team joining up and making Maniac Mansion III</saying>
<saying who="themachinist">hmm that would be cool. haven’t played MM</saying>
<saying who="xeno">themachinist: MM2 is better known as Day of the Tentacle</saying>
<saying who="xeno">themachinist: and it&#39;s the best adventure games of all time, easily spins circles around both Monkey Island and Sam &amp; Max</saying>
<saying who="themachinist">heresy!</saying>
<saying who="xeno">play it, then say heresy again! it&#39;s insanely good</saying>
<saying who="themachinist">now i have something to do this weekend</saying>
<saying who="xeno">definitely... and unless you cheat, probably longer :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: I preferred the Monkey Islands over Day of the Tentacle.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: and I finished the Day of the Tentacle.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: it&#39;s a good idea not to state an opinion as a fact. :-)</saying>
<saying who="xeno">I would play DotT first, Sam &amp; Max second, Monkey Island II third, not sure about 4th</saying>
<saying who="xeno">rindolf: but it&#39;s a fact that DotT is the best! :)</saying>
<saying who="themachinist">Twey: i think its busybox, not sure how to tell</saying>
<saying who="themachinist">jkbbwr: ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: &quot;In my opinion, it&#39;s a fact!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="xeno">rindolf: exactly!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: stop! You don&#39;t exist! You cannot have opinions.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: I am not -&gt; I think not.</saying>
<saying who="xeno">rindolf: you don&#39;t need to exist or to think for DotT to be the best adventure game :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: you cannot have opinions and you certainly cannot state facts.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: DotT does not exist! Thus, it can not be played.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: the Matrix HAZ YOU!</saying>
<saying who="xeno">rindolf: of course the matrix has me</saying>
<saying who="xeno">or I have the matrix</saying>
<saying who="xeno">or maybe I am the matrix</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: in which cell? ;-)</saying>
<saying who="xeno">#9, the one with the soft fluffy walls</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: a matrix is two-dimensional.</saying>
<saying who="xeno">only inside the matrix</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: maybe an Evil Genius convinced us that matrices are a valid mathematical concept.</saying>
<saying who="Twey">Matrices are just a special case of tensors.</saying>
<saying who="xeno">rindolf: that&#39;s likely, but you don&#39;t even need that... the Evil Genius argument is just Descartes being incapable of imagining himself as not created by something conscious</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Twey: &quot;Flobakonins are just a special case of loremipsums.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Twey">rindolf: Gesundheit!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Twey: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: i agree that reality can be very different from what we perceive it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: assuming powerful enough misconceptionists.</saying>

<saying who="pulse">pesky carrots, won&#39;t get away from me this time</saying>
<saying who="PlanckWalk">If you eat cats, then you&#39;ll be reducing the amount of meat eaten in the world.</saying>
<saying who="adsc">shotgunning the ground is a surprisingly effective way to reveal the treasures that lie within</saying>
<saying who="pulse">PlanckWalk, that&#39;s paradoxical. i&#39;ll be eating meat so i&#39;ll be increasing it</saying>
<saying who="PlanckWalk">But you&#39;ll be reducing the meat that would otherwise be eaten by those cats in their life!</saying>
<saying who="pulse">ah.</saying>
<saying who="pulse">i don&#39;t mind cats eating meat</saying>
<saying who="adsc">and he&#39;ll increase the corn that&#39;s eaten by mice</saying>
<saying who="adsc">which increases world hunger</saying>
<saying who="adsc">so it&#39;s bad to eat cats</saying>
<saying who="adsc">better eat dogs</saying>
<saying who="adsc">they are useless</saying>
<saying who="adsc">although I guess they to have a positive impact on sales of the shoe industry</saying>
<saying who="adsc">so maybe it&#39;s not good to eat dogs either, or the shoe industry will falter</saying>
<saying who="pulse">now I&#39;m not hungry any more</saying>
<saying who="pulse">so this chat was somewhat beneficial</saying>

<saying who="DrIranian">hiiiiiii :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">DrIranian: can I take one of your &quot;i&quot;s?</saying>
<me_is who="DrIranian">agrees after long consideration</me_is>
<me_is who="rindolf">takes one of DrIranian &#39;s &quot;i&quot; and colours it hot pink.</me_is>
<saying who="iwanttobreakfree">how old were you when you first started programming? i was 15-16</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">iwanttobreakfree: I was about 10.</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">:D</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">iwanttobreakfree: I wrote in XT BIOS BASIC.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">iwanttobreakfree: what did you write in?</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">rindolf: Girls calling me housewife, asking me for cooking advice, and now you paint my i pink :D</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">iwanttobreakfree: what makes you think that?</saying>
<saying who="iwanttobreakfree">dunno</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">I have a book on Pascal that I&#39;ve never actually read.</saying>
<saying who="iwanttobreakfree">it seemed to simple?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">iwanttobreakfree: and IQ is a silly measurement of intelligence not to say competence and performance.</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">IQ is good for a basic measurement</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">I once passed an IQ test.</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">&gt; 60 is passing, right?</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">:(</saying>
<saying who="iwanttobreakfree">actually you can have super high competence, but when you don&#39;t want to do the job, then it doesn&#39;t count</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">105 is passing</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">vdamewood: if you can turn on IRC, you probably have 105</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">isn&#39;t the average IQ 90?</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">rindolf: 100</saying>
<saying who="Serpentine_">Values below a small threshold deviating from 100 are generally very inaccurate</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">DrIranian: &quot;turn on IRC&quot;?</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">rindolf: The same IQ in different countries is not the same</saying>
<saying who="Serpentine_">100 points is defined as the mean and median in IQ tests</saying>
<saying who="Zeno`">no wonder people are so stupid</saying>
<me_is who="vdamewood">passed Zeno` the state-sponsored happy pills.</me_is>

<saying who="DrIranian">I want pink bile</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vdamewood: so it will match the colour of DrIranian &#39;s &quot;i&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">rindolf: Your only other choices are blood and phlegm</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">I can give you a mixture of 1 parts blood, 5 parts phlegm</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vdamewood: that&#39;s OK, I still have a lot of hot pink paint left to colour that bile.</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">vdamewood: those are the standard options, we are talking about tuning the fluids</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">LOL.</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">WTF is happening.</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">`echo &#39;a&#39; &gt; Foo`</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">Then reading it in, say, Haskell and Java, it&#39;s &quot;a\n&quot;</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">not sure how portable -n is.</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">rindolf: Oh, I see.</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">IIRC --&gt; In internet-relay chat</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">rindolf: That doesn&#39;t explain why vim and nano also saves that way though.</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">Because vim and nano assume you want a new line at the end of your text file.</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">vdamewood: I see.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Myrl-saki: it&#39;s a configuration option.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Myrl-saki: kate doesn&#39;t do it by default.</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">vdamewood: Why though?</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">colours the newline hot pink.</me_is>
<saying who="vdamewood">Because they&#39;re text files.</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">vdamewood: What&#39;s the benefit of such?</saying>
<saying who="iwanttobreakfree">guys i have a genius idea: to make a programming language which supports all syntaxes ( func. programming, logic programming, OOP, etc)</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">iwanttobreakfree: lol</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Myrl-saki: for once cat $file works nicer.</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">iwanttobreakfree: C++?</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">iwanttobreakfree: is this back in the future?</saying>

<me_is who="rindolf">colours 10 of these cents hot pink.</me_is>
<me_is who="vdamewood">pats Archer on the head.</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">iwanttobreakfree: we have a saying in Hebrew : &quot;Catch a lot - didn&#39;t catch anything&quot;</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">Looks like 60 seconds are up.</saying>
<saying who="iwanttobreakfree">such a approach would result a highly effective program code and it would save thousands of human lives and it&#39;s a work of a lifetime for some people.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">iwanttobreakfree: also, reportedly Linus Torvalds once said that his primary responsibility as the chief developer of the Linux kernel is to say &quot;No.&quot;.</saying>

<saying who="SillyMusings">How much money can I expect to make as a developer out of college?</saying>
<saying who="quelqun_dautre">SillyMusings: 0$. Tax deduced.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">quelqun_dautre: well, that&#39;s a lower bound.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">SillyMusings: the correct answer is that it varies based on several parameters.</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">rindolf, what are the parameters?</saying>
<saying who="quelqun_dautre">what you know, what framework you can use, how good you are in an interview, where you are</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">SillyMusings: 1. Where are you located. 2. Which languages do you know. 3. where you&#39;ll get hired.</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">I know Javascript and Java</saying>
<saying who="quelqun_dautre">where are you located ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">SillyMusings: it&#39;s spelled &quot;JavaScript&quot; - not &quot;Javascript&quot;</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">I am located in Oregon</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">how much money you&#39;ll make is not a function of any of those inputs.</saying>
<saying who="quelqun_dautre">and how good are you at Java[script] ?</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">sad to say it&#39;s barely a function at all. predictability in terms of actual earnings is impossible these days.</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">I&#39;d say I&#39;m okay at it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">quelqun_dautre: Java and JavaScript are two completely different things.</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">if you want some examples, look at GlassDoor.</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">What sort of range am I looking at?</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">SillyMusings: GlassDoor.</saying>
<saying who="quelqun_dautre">rindolf: I know.</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">SillyMusings: anything from us will be an incomplete picture.</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">SillyMusings: so draw from multiple sources.</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">If I&#39;m fresh out of college, am I a &#39;junior developer&#39;?</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">probably. god knows what you&#39;ll be placed into.</saying>
<saying who="quelqun_dautre">SillyMusings: what is &quot;okay&quot; on your terms ? Do you know the play framework ? J2EE ?</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">SillyMusings: I certainly hope you aren&#39;t expecting a lot of money.</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">quelqun_dautre, no I&#39;m stronger on the JS side</saying>
<saying who="pilne">Java and javascript are often used in the same &quot;completed&quot; project these days, but they are completely different beasts for better or worse</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">little_bit, glassdoor says average of 103k?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">quelqun_dautre: http://stackoverflow.com/a/245073 - case in point. ;-)</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">SillyMusings: for what position?</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">and where?</saying>
<saying who="pilne">javascript is relatively strong right now due to node.js, it isn&#39;t ideal for *everything* but it can do a lot</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">thinks serving Java web applets from a Node.js service is bestest</me_is>
<saying who="TubbyTommy">JavaScript is relatively strong on it&#39;s own because they keep making it better, its not ever finished really</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">yes I&#39;ve been following es6 stuff</saying>
<saying who="pilne">erm... rindolf?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pilne: that was a joke! Relax!</saying>
<saying who="pilne">yeah, but it is starting to add cruft</saying>
<saying who="quelqun_dautre">SillyMusings: what do you know in JS ? What library can you use ? Ever used functional programming ? Do you know what a closure is ?</saying>
<saying who="pilne">LOL i would hope so rindolf, that isn&#39;t impossible, i just can&#39;t see why you&#39;d do it other than being a code-massochist</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">SillyMusings: I&#39;m going to assume you&#39;re fresh out of college, so let me make this clear: you&#39;re not getting those jobs.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pilne: use the wrong tool for the job! ;-)</saying>

<saying who="pyon">rindolf: i have no idea how marketing people think... what exactly is going on in their heads when they determine that renaming os x to macOS might increase sales or whatever apple is trying to achieve</saying>
<saying who="pyon">rindolf: perhaps it&#39;s for consistency with iOS?</saying>
<saying who="exio4">nvm</saying>
<saying who="exio4">pyon: I think they want to add curiosity</saying>

<saying who="pyon">s/product/desktop os/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pyon: well, I&#39;ve seen many people misspell &quot;Mac OS X&quot; as &quot;MacOSX&quot; / &quot;macOSX&quot; / &quot;macosx&quot; / &quot;macosX&quot; / etc. and been trying to get them to use the correct spelling and capitalisation and now it&#39;s different and lamer.</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife">Isn&#39;t it called iOS now?</saying>
<saying who="pyon">rindolf: lol</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife">Or is that only for mobile devices?</saying>
<saying who="pyon">rindolf: i don&#39;t think it&#39;s terribly important if people spell it correctly</saying>
<saying who="bacon1989">no, that&#39;s iMobile, they renamed that yesterday in the conf</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife">Seriously?</saying>
<saying who="pyon">rindolf: it&#39;s not a real English word, it&#39;s just a product name - the only ones who should be worried about properly spelling its name are apple themselves</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">SlashLife: iOS is different than Mac OS X.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pyon: I&#39;ve invented a pun on Mac OS X - &quot;Mac O&#39;Sucks&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">it&#39;s not too funny though.</saying>
<saying who="pyon">rindolf: lol</saying>
<saying who="pyon">rindolf: i always thought “x” was meant to be pronounced “ten”</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pyon: maybe, but no one pronounces it that way.</saying>

<saying who="password2">why?</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">seems to break stuff</saying>
<saying who="Rounin">It&#39;s recently caused people to miss out on large parts of their exams</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">at least on my computer</saying>
<saying who="Rounin">Since they were answering them on Windows computers</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">but it might also be something to do with acer and McAfee</saying>
<saying who="Rounin">That of course decided to reboot for 1,5 hours during the exams</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">though the windows update is definitely the catalyst</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rounin: &quot;Windows Update ate my homework!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Rounin">rindolf: Brrr!</saying>
<saying who="password2">Rounin, Well</saying>
<saying who="password2">one would wonder why the people would set the settings on those pc to auto update</saying>
<saying who="password2">i blame the people using it</saying>
<saying who="Rounin">password2: They wouldn&#39;t... Windows set those settings</saying>
<saying who="password2">Rounin, you can change them</saying>
<saying who="Rounin">password2: That&#39;s not what we&#39;re discussing</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">i believe windows updates are forced with win 10</saying>
<saying who="password2">why not?</saying>
<saying who="Rounin">password2: If someone robs you, you can also choose to get shot if you so desire</saying>
<saying who="Rounin">That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s your choice to get robbed</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">you can disable them but i think it can cause problems</saying>
<saying who="password2">its seems like a cheap shot at windows</saying>
<saying who="password2">yeah</saying>
<saying who="Rounin">No, it doesn&#39;t</saying>
<saying who="Rounin">It doesn&#39;t seem like that at all</saying>
<saying who="password2">but no one was hurt</saying>
<saying who="password2">and no one plans on being robbed</saying>
<saying who="Rounin">No one plans on having their exam ruined by Windows Update either, as far as I know</saying>
<saying who="password2">idk why you bothered with that comparison</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">For the life of me I cannot understand why Windows Update takes a while to do its thing *before* the system shutdown.</saying>
<saying who="password2">rindolf idk</saying>
<saying who="password2">BTW Rounin if you want to blame default setting on windows , you apparently have very little experience with Linux</saying>
<saying who="password2">because that's like half the trouble with Linux</saying>
<saying who="Rounin">password2: That&#39;s not true either... I don&#39;t apparently have very little experience with Linux</saying>

<saying who="fanfan">When should I use BitKeeper (peer-to-peer) and when should I use GitHub (client-server) for my software project?</saying>
<saying who="yawkat">fanfan: git is distributed</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">fanfan: why do you want to use BitKeeper?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">fanfan: and git is distributed too.</saying>
<saying who="fanfan">rindolf, I didn&#39;t understand.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">fanfan: git is peer-to-peer - just like BitKeeper.</saying>
<saying who="fanfan">rindolf, so when should I use Git and when should I use GitHub?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">fanfan: there are other git services aside from GitHub and you can set up one of your own.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">fanfan: you normally use git to interact with GitHub.</saying>
<saying who="fanfan">rindolf, I don&#39;t really know what should I do, can please guide me.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">fanfan: use GitHub if you like it - if not - use a different git service provider.</saying>
<saying who="fanfan">rindolf, well I choose GitHub because there are already millions of people using it, so it seems trustworthy.</saying>
<saying who="baum">fanfan: same for bitbucket and others</saying>
<saying who="fanfan">baum, I will just use GitHub before I get crazy in all these options.</saying>
<saying who="baum">fanfan: you could also just use git</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">fanfan: it seems like a good choice at the moment.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">baum: we told him that.</saying>
<saying who="fanfan">baum, So Git is better than BitKeeper?</saying>
<saying who="catbadger">git is better than everything</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">baum: this seems like one of those &#39;Should I use jQuery or JavaScript?&#39; questions.</saying>
<saying who="baum">rindolf: oh i see, didn&#39;t read up. and yes it does</saying>
<saying who="fanfan">rindolf, I get it now, I people use GitHub because they don&#39;t have a server or online-storage, and they don&#39;t want to. But I have a server so I can just use BitKeeper.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">fanfan: well, BitKeeper was made open source only relatively recently, which caused git (and previously other FOSS VCSes) to become popular instead.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">fanfan: why do you want to use bitkeeper?</saying>
<saying who="fanfan">rindolf, because 15 years of development</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">fanfan: you can set up a git service on your server as well.</saying>
<saying who="fanfan">rindolf, and is supported by a big company</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">fanfan: well, git probably had more contributors.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">fanfan: which big company supports BK?</saying>
<saying who="fanfan">rindolf, just please tell me, for god&#39;s sake, should I use GitHub or Git?</saying>
<saying who="baum">fanfan: if you are judging a source control solution by its company and years of existence maybe check out Visual SourceSafe :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">fanfan: I suggest you use git and you can opt to use GitHub as well.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">baum: heh, I laughed-out-loud from that comment.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">baum: can I tweet it?</saying>
<saying who="fanfan">rindolf, is GitHub best of its kind?</saying>
<saying who="baum">rindolf: go for it :)</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">baum: thanks!</saying>
<saying who="fanfan">okay guys, I will just use GitHub, before I get crAZY, now everyone shut up.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: generalised Freecell was shown to be NP-complete</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">NP-complete means?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: here?</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Yup.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Just came back.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: did you read about NP-completeness?</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Nope.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">What is it?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Too much math.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">On wikipedia.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: see http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=memoir-from-a-Physics-lesson-in-the-9th-grade</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">rindolf: Sometimes formality can make things more complex than they really are.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: true</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">rindolf: Can you give me a simple introduction?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: well, do you know what polynomial time is?</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">No.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: hmmm...</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">I know what a polynomial is.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Is this related to the BigO notation?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: yes.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: polynomial time is O(P(N)) where P(N) is a polynomial of N</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">OK.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">I am trying to think of an example..</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">two nested loops</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: so it can be O(n^2) or O(n) or O(n*log(n)) or even O(n**100)</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Aha.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">What is &#39;n&#39;? Number of operations?</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Umm.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Probably not.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: the length of the input</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Yeah that makes sense.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: OK.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">I remember stuff about search algorithms.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">n is the number of entries in an array, for example.</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">yep</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: now, some problems&#39; *verification algorithm* is polynomial and these problems are called &quot;NP&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Verification algorithm?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: verification means you verify that the solution is correct after given one.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Aha.</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">Rashad: for example, if I give you a list and tell you that it&#39;s sorted, you can verify in polynomial time that it is correct</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">by simply checking each pair of elements</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">A solution in freecell is a series of moves?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: yes</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">sbrg: I see.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">OK so NP *complete* means?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: now, some problems are NP-hard which means that each of them can be used to solve any problem in NP after a polynomial transformation.</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">and NP complete are problems which are both in NP and NP-hard</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: yes, what sbrg said,</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">so, NP: a problem that, when given a solution, you can verify that it is correct in polynomial time</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">NP-hard: a class of problems that can be converted to each other</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">OK.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">OK.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">So NP-hard does not imply NP?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: no, not necessarily</saying>
<saying who="kadoban">No, problems that are harder than NP are in NP-hard too</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Ahhh</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Now that makes sense.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">*at least NP hard*</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: for instance, the Halting Problem is NP hard.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">OK now everything is in place for me.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: good</saying>
<saying who="kadoban">It gets complicated because we don&#39;t know the actual hard relationships between many of the complexity classes, like we don&#39;t actually know if P = NP or if there are problems in NP that aren&#39;t in P. Which leads to the famous question you&#39;ve likely heard of.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">But I am interested by how you can map NP-hard problems from one to the other.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: there&#39;s a 1 million USD prize for proving whether P is NP or not,</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">kadoban: It got pretty philosophical fast :P</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">P = ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: P is the class of polynomial problems</saying>
<saying who="kadoban">P, the complexity class above, which is problems you can solve in polynomial time on a deterministic turing machine.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">I am a bit confused now..</saying>
<saying who="kadoban">NP, problems you can verify solutions to in polynomial time on a deterministic turing machine.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">OK so NP is about verification, P is about solving. Correct?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: well yes, but you often want to find good solutions for NP problems</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">What do you mean?</saying>
<saying who="kadoban">Correct, though that&#39;s really just a definition used for picking which complexity class. In general we&#39;re still interested in getting the answer to problems in NP</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Ah.</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">Rashad: P is the class of problems that can be *solved* in polynomial time. NP is the class of problems *whose solution can be verified* in polynomial time.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">So the concern is: Can you find a solution to NP problems faster than you can verify the given solution?</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">Rashad: Assuming you mean &quot;faster or as fast&quot;, well.. you just asked whether P = NP</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">I see.</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">if you have an answer to that question, someone will give you a million dollars</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">But how is that not a philosophical question, though?</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Let me rephrase that.</saying>
<saying who="kadoban">It depends, what&#39;s a &quot;philosophical question&quot;?</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">kadoban: that is ^</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">lol</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Wouldn&#39;t a solution imply a way to verify it?</saying>
<saying who="kadoban">But if you&#39;re asking if it has practical consequences, it does, potentially.</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">Rashad: Well, take sudoku as an example</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">OK!</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">If I give you a solved sudoku, how long would it take for you to verify it?</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">kadoban: What kind of consequences?</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">it&#39;s the same every time. you just make sure that 1 to 9 appears in all rows, columns and boxes</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">sbrg: OK</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">however, does seeing the solution tell you how you solve it?</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">How as in, which steps</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">OK that&#39;s exactly what I am asking.</saying>
<saying who="kadoban">Rashad: For example if P = NP, then quite a lot of cryptography isn&#39;t very well founded. That would mean there were &quot;quick&quot; (in one way of speaking) algorithms to solve hard problems that crypto relies on, such as discrete logarithm and integer factorization.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">How do you get an answer that is not completely random that in the same process of figuring it out you are unable to replicate the same logic into how you verify it?</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">And we&#39;re still talking about computers here so I am not sure if Newton&#39;s apple aha moment counts...</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">Rashad: sometimes it&#39;s easier to assert the validity a solution (P) than it is to explain it (NP)</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">or... those reversed</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">i forget.</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">Rashad: well, how easy is it to verify a sudoku? it&#39;s very easy. it&#39;s the same steps every time. however, does that knowledge of the rules of the game allow you to also solve the puzzle in an equal number of moves it took you to verify it?</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">sbrg: The solution however is ultimately guided by the rules of verification.</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">sbrg: poorly formed... technically speaking it can be easier to solve some given sudoku puzzles than it is to verify they are solved</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Unless it is a complete shot in the dark.</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">Gamah: and there are lists that are already sorted. that doesn&#39;t change the lower bound for sorting. what&#39;s your point?</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">Rashad: Yes, it is. so one would think that it would be possible</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">and as Gamah pointed out, some sudokus are very easy to solve, while others are much harder</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">Rashad: no p</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">:P</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">the question is whether you can give an algorithm that guarantees that you can solve every sudoku within some time limit(in terms of the size of the input) that performs no more steps than you would verifying a sudoku</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">sbrg: I&#39;m saying you can&#39;t apply the act of solving and the act of verifying a &quot;solved&quot; sudoku to p=np because in the space of sudoku, either task could be on either side of the equation</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">define &quot;steps&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">because it always takes less steps to solve than verify... from some perspective</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">rindolf: So solitaire is O(n)?</saying>
<saying who="sbrg"> Gamah: you don&#39;t seem to understand complexity theory. we&#39;re talking about sudokus in general. I can verify *any* sudoku in some bounded polynomial time</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Ah sorry, I meant verifying a solitaire solution is O(n)*.</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">you can also solve any sudoku</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">the question is whether I can somehow use the rules of verification to help me create a solution in at most as much time as it would take me to verify it. i.e. P vs NP</saying>
<saying who="workmad3">iirc, NP-complete problems are ones where verifying a solution is polynomial time, but calculating a solution is non-polynomial</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: there are many variants of card solitaire</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">sbrg: but the number of sudoku permutations and solutions is not unbound...</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: generalised Freecell is NP-complete</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: which assumes you have n ranks of cards instead of 13 (ace-to-king)</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">Gamah: for a 9x9 sudoku, no, obviously not. but we are talking about sudoku in general</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">hmm.</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">Rashad: at any rate, the point is that we just don&#39;t know whether we can use the information that lets us verify solutions in polynomial time to also construct solutions in polynomial time</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">i feel like sudoku is still a search problem (IE: rainbow table)</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">and not really applicable</saying>
<saying who="workmad3">Gamah: and how long would it take you to compute that rainbow table?</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">by your logic, I can solve any problem that way.</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">i can just create a database of all sorted lists.</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">sure...</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">.. just like i can create a database of all sudokus. if we fix n, then yes, it is bounded and you can just solve it in constant time.</saying>
<saying who="kadoban">sbrg: Well, not really, you still have lookup time.</saying>
<saying who="kadoban">Oh, for fixed n I guess that doesn&#39;t matter.</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">constant time where a unit is defined to be the lookup time</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">there you go!</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">workmad3: that would depend on how well i could optimize the verification algo</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">it&#39;s all about context</saying>
<saying who="workmad3">sbrg: well, you can solve it in constant time, assuming the existence of an oracle :)</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">the $1m question just says &quot;a computer&quot; and &quot;in polynomial time&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">it doesn&#39;t say i can&#39;t spend years precomputing the search space</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">:)</saying>
<saying who="sbrg">i don&#39;t think you understand what P vs NP means</saying>
<saying who="workmad3">Gamah: assuming the existence of an oracle is generally not classed as a solution to P vs NP</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">i thought the smiley implied i was being pedantic</saying>
<saying who="workmad3">Gamah: otherwise it would have been solved years ago :P</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">workmad3: well i was just going to use oracle DB</saying>
<saying who="Gamah">:)</saying>

<saying who="FManTropyx">my apartment badly needs garbage collection (hi, BTW)</saying>
<saying who="liste">FManTropyx: no-op garbage collector&#39;s an option :)</saying>
<saying who="adsc">you could add some rats, they take care of the organic garbage</saying>

<saying who="workmad3">adsc: and then add some cats to convert the rat problem into an extra type?</saying>
<saying who="adsc">which rat problem?</saying>
<saying who="workmad3">adsc: the rat problem caused by introducing rats to solve your garbage problem :P</saying>
<saying who="adsc">rats are a problem?</saying>
<saying who="adsc">hmmm</saying>
<saying who="adsc">yes, it seems one cat per 5 rats should solve any &quot;rat problems&quot;</saying>
<saying who="wedr">So, you&#39;re saying for those who live near a farm, they need to get 65 cats?</saying>
<saying who="adsc">yes</saying>
<saying who="adsc">although I guess it doesn&#39;t scale up linearly</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">heh</saying>
<saying who="adsc">each additional cat probably raises the number of total rats that can be dealt with</saying>
<saying who="adsc">so two cats might be able to deal with more than 10 rats</saying>

<saying who="Zajt">Hello! Is this UML diagram https://go.gliffy.com/go/share/sm4frpobsubifu6j6jv8 a correct example of the factory method design pattern?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zajt: is this homework?</saying>
<saying who="Zajt">rindolf kind of, it&#39;s from school work but the purpose is not to make a UML diagram. I just try to explain the pattern by making this figure, but needs to be sure that it&#39;s correct so I don&#39;t miss anything in it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zajt: ah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zajt: it figures that it is schoolwork</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">UML&#39;s main purpose is to keep CS profs employed and students busy</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">SPEEDRAC1ST: heh</saying>
<saying who="iawc">Though the profs still suffer a concussion when doing both at the same time.</saying>
<saying who="Zajt">rindolf what do you mean?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zajt: UML and Design Patterns are not oof much interest elsewhere</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">design patterns became a buzzword recently</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">also, &quot;anti-pattern&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zajt">yeah but did you read what I wrote above? I do it for a report in school so I have not an exercise that says &quot;Write this UML-diagram&quot;, but I have done it myself just to illustrate the problem. But I want to make sure it&#39;s correct what I have done</saying>
<saying who="Groogy">design patterns and anti-pattern are super old buzzwords</saying>
<saying who="Groogy">what do you mean recently</saying>
<saying who="Groogy">the last 30 years?</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">recently there was a resurgence of those</saying>
<saying who="Groogy">lol okay</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">&quot;we&#39;re kewl, we use JavaScript design patterns&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Groogy">Designu-patteru-jutsu</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">are you a pattern-ninja?</saying>
<saying who="Groogy">HAI!</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">then join our innovative revolutionary startup which has lots of hype and VC monies</saying>
<saying who="Groogy">Actually I think it is good to read about design patterns and anti-patterns, to just have in back of your mind. But to actively try and &quot;apply&quot; the &quot;molds&quot; is not really the intent of it</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">some of those are neat. the ones that are about complexity management, and organization</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">but most are barely necessary</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">but overall, WTF would one need design patterns to make yet another web app?</saying>

<saying who="merijn">Hell, people can&#39;t even make decent apps yet...</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">define decent</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">Instagram and Snapchat are totally decent for uploading food pics and duckface pics</saying>
<saying who="merijn">SPEEDRAC1ST: They&#39;re several gigabytes larger than they should be</saying>
<saying who="ongy">snapchat? isn&#39;t that exclusively for sexting?</saying>
<saying who="ongy">you have phone apps that are multiple gigabytes?</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">merijn: so is all software these days, except for embedded</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">ongy: if you include the SDK, yes</saying>
<saying who="merijn">ongy: I&#39;d like to introduce you to my friend, the hyperbole :)</saying>

<saying who="Groogy">25mb</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">rts-sander: heard of progressive web apps?</saying>
<saying who="merijn">ongy: WTF are you doing? Chrome is at, like, 1GB for me with 40 or so tabs open in 4 windows</saying>
<saying who="Batholith">Chrome likes to eat RAM, that is known</saying>
<saying who="Zajt">haha SPEEDRAC1ST</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">here kwin_x11 consumes more RAM than firefox - no idea why</saying>
<saying who="xssposed">there's an extension that counteracts Chrome's hunger for RAM. i forget the name of it, but it saves 90%</saying>
<saying who="merijn">Chrome&#39;s memory usage is increased a bit by the fact that it uses 1 process per tab, but it&#39;s not that drastic. Most of the gross memory usage that people blame on Chrome is just really &quot;websites being shitty in the 2010s&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rockman37">rindolf: Is it huge, or is Firefox small?</saying>
<saying who="xssposed">has my browser running faster</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rockman37: well, i recently restarted ff</saying>
<saying who="rockman37">rindolf: Ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xssposed: heh, nice nickname</saying>

<me_is who="rindolf">recently reduced the HTML of his site</me_is>

<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">also, JS frameworks and libs are 100+K LoC</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">SPEEDRAC1ST: are they webscale?</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">maybe. they&#39;re responsive for sure</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/slash-dev-null_is_WebScale/</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">SPEEDRAC1ST: both responsive and progressive? Impossibru</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">you can only have at most 1</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">progressive is the new buzzword, gotta replace them to keep the hype alive</saying>
<saying who="merijn">Man, the one JS keyword that pisses me off the most is &quot;isomorphic&quot;, because that&#39;s not what isomorphic means, you jackasses</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">SPEEDRAC1ST: are progressive web apps webscale enough?</saying>
<saying who="ongy">I want a /dev/null directory to copy things into...</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">rindolf: come on. webscale is so 5 years ago :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ongy: use asynchronous writes</saying>
<saying who="okuu">merijn: I edited the “isomorphism” tag on Stack Overflow to explicitly refer to, you know, isomorphisms. :-p</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">SPEEDRAC1ST: heh</saying>
<saying who="merijn">okuu: &lt;3</saying>
<saying who="merijn">ongy: Why?</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">merijn: is it a reserved keyword?</saying>
<saying who="merijn">SPEEDRAC1ST: No, it&#39;s &quot;running the same code on the client as on the server&quot;, or some shit</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">JS&#39;s scope pisses me off the most. something as simple as accessing a variable inside foreach is complicated</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">merijn: oh, you mean buzzword</saying>
<saying who="merijn">s/&#39;s scope//</saying>
<saying who="merijn">SPEEDRAC1ST: Yeah, I haven&#39;t had my coffee yet</saying>
<saying who="okuu">SPEEDRAC1ST: But there is an excuse - JavaScript was designed in 10 days!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ongy: mount /dev/null as /home</saying>
<saying who="okuu">Errr, designed and implemented.</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">okuu: because Netscape managers rejected a Scheme-based language. and Self-based one too</saying>
<saying who="okuu">rindolf: Double-checking my solutions to my topology handout.</saying>
<saying who="merijn">I respect Brendan Eichman, because for something designed and implemented in 10 days JS is an impressive feat. But as language...god...fuck it</saying>
<saying who="merijn">okuu: Sounds more fun that figuring out how to formulate my API to work with 3 slightly different libraries that don&#39;t have a common API :)</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">merijn: he proposed to use Scheme, Netscape said &quot;no way&quot;. Then he decided to prank them with JS. and now we&#39;re paying for it</saying>
<saying who="ongy">rindolf: still a file, so I can&#39;t access /home/ongy</saying>
<saying who="ongy">merijn: because I wanted to direct an output directory to /dev/null before and it didn&#39;t work</saying>
<saying who="okuu">merijn: At least I&#39;m allowed (in fact, required) to make sense.</saying>
<saying who="merijn">okuu: Trying to make my library play nicely with pipes, conduits, and just regular old forM/mapM...it&#39;s...tricky :p</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">SPEEDRAC1ST: it needed to resemble Java</saying>
<saying who="merijn">ongy: I don&#39;t quite understand what &quot;copying to /dev/null&quot; is supposed to do, though?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">merijn: oooh - buzzwords</saying>
<saying who="mniip">but those are words</saying>
<saying who="merijn">rindolf: Hmm?</saying>
<saying who="ongy">merijn: why are you doing that? is it something you want others to use?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">merijn: &quot;pipes&quot;, &quot;conduits&quot;</saying>
<saying who="okuu">rindolf: Haskell plumbing libraries.</saying>
<saying who="merijn">rindolf: They are haskell libraries :)</saying>
<saying who="ongy">merijn: ignore all output that should be written there. sometimes I need that</saying>
<saying who="merijn">ongy: Because I use a mix of pipes and conduits in different projects and I find myself reinventing the same boilerplate</saying>
<saying who="merijn">ongy: And I wanna be done with it once and for all</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">I&#39;ve learned about Cloud Haskell a few months ago</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">I guess they chose the name for marketing reasons</saying>
<saying who="mniip">merijn, that &quot;once and for all&quot; bit sounds unconvincing</saying>
<saying who="okuu">rindolf: Basically, so that you can replace “going crazy debugging” with “doing crazy with types” when doing stream processing. Although the “going crazy debugging” is sometimes not completely avoided.</saying>
<saying who="merijn">mniip: Why?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">okuu: heh, sounds nasty</saying>
<saying who="okuu">rindolf: Yeah, but it&#39;s how Haskellers think.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">okuu: haskellers are crazy?</saying>
<saying who="okuu">rindolf: Everyone is crazy in their own way.</saying>
<saying who="mniip">I must say haskell debugging sucks</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">okuu: true</saying>
<saying who="iawc">okuu: Haskell is just an API for common structures.</saying>
<saying who="mniip">why does everyone try to mimic imperative program debugging</saying>
<saying who="merijn">okuu: To be fair, conduits/pipes DO make some tasks that are really obnoxious in other languages really nice</saying>
<saying who="iawc">Or is that Ruby?</saying>
<saying who="mniip">functional semantics need to reflect respectively in the debugger</saying>
<saying who="iawc">They seem the same in a way.</saying>
<saying who="rockman37">iawc: Ruby and Haskell?</saying>
<saying who="merijn">rindolf: Basically, they abstract over &quot;I want to stream process data from a pipe/socket/file/whatever in constant memory&quot;</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">sounds like a job for a queue</saying>
<saying who="okuu">merijn: Then it turns out you want to backtrack, and everything goes to hell.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rockman37: reminds me of that guy who said Visual Basic was essentially the same as C++</saying>
<saying who="merijn">okuu: So, don&#39;t do that then :)</saying>
<saying who="merijn">okuu: I have plenty of cases where I don&#39;t need that</saying>
<saying who="merijn">okuu: If you need backtracking, use STM or something</saying>
<saying who="okuu">merijn: I have to admit, when you don&#39;t need to backtrack, pipes and conduit are very nice.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rockman37: and then went on to try to create a lossless audio compression that could compress a 40 MB WAV file into 20 kB</saying>
<saying who="rockman37">rindolf: Well, I wouldn&#39;t touch either :p</saying>
<saying who="merijn">SPEEDRAC1ST: Yeah, except that all the annoying bits of getting data, putting them in queues, adapting your code to read from them, etc. has all been done for you</saying>
<saying who="rockman37">rindolf: Lossless?</saying>
<saying who="mniip">something something yoctoparsec</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rockman37: yes</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">merijn: by the corresponding libraries?</saying>
<saying who="merijn">SPEEDRAC1ST: They&#39;re basically a bunch of tools for turning stuff like a parser for a single object you wrote into one that gets fed data on demands and output an object every time it finishes (with further tools to incrementally process those)</saying>
<saying who="merijn">SPEEDRAC1ST: It&#39;s not earth-shattering rocket science. It&#39;s just a bunch of really convenient tools that I haven&#39;t found an adequate replacement for in other languages</saying>
<saying who="okuu">merijn: Probably because they aren&#39;t conveniently expressible in other languages. :-p</saying>
<saying who="mniip">everything is possible when you have programmable semicolons</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rockman37: i think he was the one who was going on about that Planet Source Code thingy</saying>
<saying who="okuu">SPEEDRAC1ST: Think iterators on steroids.</saying>
<saying who="SPEEDRAC1ST">merijn: OK. I haven&#39;t had that exactly problem, but if I had I&#39;d use something like Elixir&#39;s GenStage</saying>
<saying who="rockman37">Programmable semicolons sound nasty.</saying>
<saying who="rockman37">rindolf: Haven&#39;t heard of that.</saying>
<saying who="mniip">rockman37, ish, perl does that all the time</saying>
<saying who="rockman37">&quot;4.3 million lines of source code examples and apps to build from.&quot; Hmm...</saying>
<saying who="rockman37">mniip: Interesting.</saying>
<saying who="iawc">howdy do dat?</saying>
<saying who="mniip">anyway, I remotely remember someone saying that monads (their do-block syntax specifically) are just programmable semicolons</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rockman37: under a contradictory licence</saying>
<saying who="rockman37">rindolf: Serves users right, I say.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">patientplatypus: the game?</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">yeah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">patientplatypus: ah</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">its a challenging problem</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">LOL I&#39;m picturing players taking their turns by submitting database queries with their requests</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">but it would be useful to be able to use a tree structure</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">I'm just making the game sheet</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">There&#39;s at least one game like that</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">if i get that working that would be a hat trick</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">patientplatypus: you can encode trees using a table or two</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">hmmm</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">ADD &quot;MOVE, 1&quot; TO TABLE &quot;MOVE_QUEUE_$PLAYER_NAME&quot;</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">AbleBacon: https://schemaverse.com/</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">i always feel like SQL people are screaming</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">AHHHHH</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">&quot;Compete against other players using raw SQL commands to command your fleet.&quot; picard never had to do this</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">patientplatypus: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sql+tree&amp;ia=qa</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">&quot;CAPTAIN, we&#39;ve lost control of our primary command instruments! all commands to the ship will have to be issued via MICROSOFT sql queries&quot;</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">&quot;... number one, give the order to abandon ship.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">AbleBacon: heh</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">i may just use lots of tables without the tree - looks overly complicated</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">patientplatypus: what?</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">Why do you need trees of tables?</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">oh well....i was thinking trees but it just looks like this would be sort of sucky</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">AbleBacon: I&#39;d be screaming too if I had to write SQL for a living.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">patientplatypus: every purpose should have a single table</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">&quot;you adopted capslock for internet arguments... i was born with capslock&quot;</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">I remember computers before lowercase was invented :P</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">How is a game like flappy bird ported to so many systems?</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">I mean what makes it so easy to port?</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">I mean it&#39;s been ported to the snes,gba,etc</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">&quot;captain, our systems are down! we can only match enemy ships for targeting using regex!&quot; &quot;... number one, issue the command &quot;.*&quot;&quot; &quot;but sir there are civi-&quot; &quot;i give up&quot;</saying>
<saying who="jrslepak">CashDash123: how complex is the game itself?</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">no very jrslepak but how was the source code obtained or was it reverse engineered?</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">CashDash123, the logic behind the game is very simple. if it was written in, say, C++ there&#39;s probably a C++ compiler for all of those systems. the only thing that would change really is how to display the graphics</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">ah--birds were the key to the game&#39;s breakthrough into success i see</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">unless the birds are just a RED HERRING!</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">wait--is a herring a fish?</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">or a bird?</saying>
<saying who="wedr_">Yeah, the Inverse Laws of Game Design, the shorter the jump distance, the more popular it gets via word of mouth</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">AbleBacon, the addiction of beating a high score lead to its popularity</saying>
<saying who="wedr_">herring is a fish yes</saying>
<saying who="wedr_">a type of tuna</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">AbleBacon: heh</saying>
<saying who="wedr_">salmon, not tuna</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">then we need to invent &quot;flappy herring&quot;</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">avoid sharks and other sea creatures idk</saying>
<saying who="wedr_">For a warning, I think it&#39;s called red harring.</saying>
<saying who="wedr_">Or haerring</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">no, &quot;red flag&quot; is a warning. &quot;red herring&quot; is something that distracts you from the real thing</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">shoot i don&#39;t know any more</saying>
<saying who="wedr_">red herring is a fish.</saying>
<saying who="wedr_">:/</saying>
<saying who="wedr_">red Sirens, maybe?</saying>
<saying who="jrslepak">it&#39;s also an idiom whose meaning is as AbleBacon described</saying>
<saying who="wedr_">In Norse mythology, Sirens are blue.</saying>
<saying who="wedr_">Or was it Greek?</saying>
<saying who="wedr_">So red Sirens is like the shiny Pokemon that distracts you in real life.</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">all those poor kids getting hit by cars looking at their phones hunting for pokemon</saying>
<saying who="wedr_">True, Pokemon Go caused kids to get hit more often</saying>
<saying who="jrslepak">the best solution is to play it on the bus :-P</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">you don&#39;t want to go on the bus in America</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">it is not a nice place</saying>
<saying who="jrslepak">I was just there a few hours ago</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">Does America only have one bus? :|</saying>
<saying who="jrslepak">haha</saying>
<saying who="jrslepak">it seems that way some evenings</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">Leads me to question of how were games ported back in the day when you would have to downgrade a game to run on a system?</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">A lot of hard work</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">kinda like how lets say you have developed a dreamcast game while also having a Linux and windows port</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">how does that work or even in reverse</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">The game engine may have to be partly rewritten but the content (graphics etc.) should be reusable</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">I mean I was thinking in a similar vain to Elysian Shadows which I&#39;m pretty sure was designed around the dreamcast</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">Which was tweaked most likely</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">that or I may also get an Idea by reading quora</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">Hmmm ... there&#39;s a #dreamcastdev channel</saying>
<saying who="horny-sama">GeDaMo: I thought dreamcast was stuff before I was born. Surprised that people still dev for it</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">There&#39;s a also an #elysian_shadows channel but only one person in it</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">People still develop for a lot of old systems</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">It&#39;s been chronicled on youtube since they were in high school in 2007</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">horny-sama, The Dreamcast due to it&#39;s discontinuation date makes it more common to have a system without protection from playing burned cdr&#39;s though it&#39;s bad for the laser</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">&quot;bad for the laser&quot;--a likely story</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">OK</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">I'm confused</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">AbleBacon, well it was designed for GD-ROM</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">how could it damage the laser, though?</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">lasers don&#39;t have any moving parts!</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">so here&#39;s my question: if i have a table with a, b, c, d, e and I want each of those 5 letters to reference 5 different tables A, B, C, D, E how would I do this in postgresql? I can link tables by foreign/primary key but I cant see how they actually reference the value its linking to</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">so</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">Why do you have 5 different tables?</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">in dnd you have paladin, fighter, etc. I want each of those items to link to a table that contains their statistics. So one table with class names, several linked tables with different statistics</saying>
<saying who="grouse">GeDaMo, gotta have redundant table in case bobby drops them ;)</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">Why can&#39;t this be in one table?</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">all classes have strength, intelligence, etc. you should have one table for shared characteristics of all classes</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">because each class is entirely different from another</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">oh i see what you&#39;re saying</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">well like wizard and fighter are so different that the tables need to be totally separate</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">the way sql seems to want to work is that it just replicates tables in a single customer/many purchases type pattern</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">does anyone have any suggestions? I'm totally lost and have been staring at this for a while</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">I&#39;m having difficulty visualising your DB structure</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">so one table for classes (fighter, wizard, etc)</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">each class will have its one table - fighter table, wizard table, paladin table</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">with their own special statistics on each</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">What fields do these tables have?</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">each table will have entirely different fields (this is the problem- if they were similar it would not be an issue). so fighter has swords and fighting, and wizard would have spells etc</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">i need what is essentially some sort of tree/json like hierarchy but in sql</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">ltree seems very confusing</saying>
<saying who="patientplatypus">what do you mean beaky?</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">What do these tables represent? Are they like D&amp;D character sheets?</saying>
<saying who="horny-sama">CashDash123: gd-rom?</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">Yeah, IRC will do that to you :|</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">horny-sama, It was Sega&#39;s specialized cd I think the reason the burned cd exploit had to do something with an exploit with the mil-cd format</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">though</saying>
<saying who="horny-sama">Is it safe to assume that gd-rom is out of production</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GD-ROM horny-sama</saying>
<saying who="horny-sama">CashDash123: did not say if it is out of production or not</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">I don&#39;t think anyone can press there games to GD-Rom any more.</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">I don&#39;t actually even own a dreamcast I just learned a bit about it</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">long ago</saying>
<saying who="horny-sama">good luck with whatever you are doing</saying>
<saying who="horny-sama">sounds cool</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">I figured it out hombre is pressed to mil-cd&#39;s</saying>
<saying who="xeno">why would anyone wanna press things onto GD-Ros any more?</saying>
<saying who="xeno">or why am I asking?</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">don&#39;t quote me on that</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">quote</saying>
<saying who="horny-sama">xeno: I think CashDash123 is doing some dreamcast dev</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">horny-sama, I&#39;m not</saying>
<saying who="horny-sama">CashDash123: so just quest for knowledge?</saying>
<saying who="xeno">horny-sama: yeah, but why?</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">It would just be a good place to get an Idea of how a game is ported</saying>
<saying who="xeno">horny-sama: it&#39;s like the  worst waste of time</saying>
<saying who="horny-sama">xeno: different people have different hobby</saying>
<saying who="xeno">yeah I know</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">oh no... we&#39;re resorting to &quot;scrum&quot; meetings every morning. things must be getting really desperate.</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">I mean how games are made for old consoles really is interesting</saying>
<saying who="horny-sama">AbleBacon: ?</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">at my work</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">and they pay me and all i have to do is not die</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Scrum-1.JPG</saying>
<saying who="horny-sama">AbleBacon: in other words, you are their basic bitch</saying>
<saying who="CashDash123">horny-sama, You could say that,and I really wanted a dreamcast a long time ago</saying>
<saying who="AbleBacon">it&#39;s not a giant wrestling orgy; it&#39;s a management technique</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">Why not both? :D</saying>
<saying who="horny-sama">AbleBacon: just hope you made your fuck you money soon so you can quit</saying>
<saying who="horny-sama">lol</saying>
<saying who="Rounin">AbleBacon: Your team just needs to move their organization to Sloth® so that all of their personal data can be sold to advertisers</saying>
<saying who="Rounin">Then you&#39;ll be truly efficient</saying>
<saying who="Rounin">And of course SourceHub™ to organize your Packer images</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">wXeno: ouch</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">wXeno: i once saw a screenshot of a gmail.com account with 130K unread messages in the inbox</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">wXeno: anyway, i hate clutter</saying>
<saying who="wXeno">if you don&#39;t tend to it, then that goes fast</saying>
<saying who="wXeno">rindolf: me too, but it&#39;s hard to avoid when I can get some hundreds of mails with actual content in an average/slightly busy day</saying>
<saying who="wXeno">rindolf: and enough of references and long running topics that I can&#39;t delete old mails without losing relevant info</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">wXeno: i move away emails to other folders</saying>
<saying who="wXeno">rindolf: me too</saying>
<saying who="wXeno">rindolf: and I delete what I can</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">wXeno: ah</saying>

<saying who="wXeno">all mails from *@* -&gt; inbox2 doesn&#39;t count :)</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">hio: i feel that ponylang is more complicated than rust</saying>
<saying who="hio">ponylang has a GC, how can it be more complicated</saying>
<saying who="hio">just the weirdo decision from the Rust team to wrap lambda arguments with | args | is crazy</saying>
<saying who="hio">they did that just to make parsing easier. Can you imagine? Wow</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">hio: well, admittedly i didn't study rust too closely</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">hio: ruby has that  too</saying>
<saying who="hio">They actually thought that making their parsing job slightly easier justifies making the language weirder and introducing new syntax that doesn't resemble function calls at all even though lambdas are basically exactly like functions</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">hio: should i be?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">tttb: ah</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">hio: i will rewrite all my perl code into $FASHION_LANGUAGE by hiring Chuck Norris, who will complete it in an hour and charge me 10,000,000 USD</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bavi: :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bavi: gmake now integrated guile scheme</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">I didn&#39;t know chuck norris could code... i figured he&#39;d just punch the computer and it would give him what he wanted...</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Era_Scarecrow: the computer just does what he wants</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Era_Scarecrow: by pure intimidation</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">hio: i like the mit licence</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">it is my go to licence for my own projects</saying>
<saying who="usr123">rindolf: Hello. Could you please take a look at my code?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">usr123: it seems fine, but you may have off-by-one errors</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">rindolf &amp; usr123&gt; I&#39;d have looked at it, but i don&#39;t use python, so i don&#39;t know.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Era_Scarecrow: python is easy</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">perhaps, I&#39;m not familiar with it, although it would mostly be syntax I&#39;d have to get familiar with.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Era_Scarecrow: someone once told me he was able to look at python code and immediately be able to tweak it without knowing it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Era_Scarecrow: i think he already knew perl 5, though</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Any reason to use fish over zsh?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: i am still using bash</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">ditto, i also use bash... Depends on if there&#39;s a specific feature you need or not.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: i found zsh too incompatible w bash</saying>
<saying who="usr123">rindolf: Well in that case, I&#39;m just returning if today is 7 and food is less or else I'm returning the first element of the array. even if it iterates one more or less would it affect the output?</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">rindolf: I am still on Bash as well, I just wanna follow the bandwagon ;)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: ah</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">bandwagon == coolKids</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">Fries&gt; why would you want to jump on a bandwagon? I don&#39;t see the point...</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">So that&#39;s why I was wondering if anyone here has used both fish and zsh and which one is better</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Or the pros and cons of both</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">rindolf: also, what you mean by incompatible with bash?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: csh is the bestest! http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/csh/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: i think $var does not expand words by default</saying>
<saying who="SigSegOwl">good morning everybody :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: the only thing better than csh is CMD.EXE</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">I guess there&#39;s plugins for that</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: j/k</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: there is an option</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">SigSegOwl: hoooooo</saying>
<saying who="usr123">unable to ask questions on their forum as well. Seems like I don&#39;t have enough points. This is bad</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">I mean zsh seems to have a way bigger community than fish</saying>
<saying who="usr123">is there a competitive programming channel on freenode?</saying>
<saying who="SigSegOwl">why do hdmi to dvi cables only work one way ?</saying>
<saying who="SigSegOwl">or even hdmi to displayport o.O ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">SigSegOwl: physics possibly</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Csh :P</saying>
<saying who="SigSegOwl">let me ask it a little bit differently... why can&#39;t i connect a screen that has vga, dvi, dp to a pc that only has hdmi xD</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">SigSegOwl&gt; Use a hammer... it will fit...</saying>
<saying who="SigSegOwl">Era_Scarecrow: hammer the screen or the pc ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: i am reminded of this too - http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=more-advanced-than-CVS</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">SigSegOwl&gt; Hammer the connection into one of your ports... so... sort them all</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Era_Scarecrow: heh</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">http://rinkworks.com/stupid/cs_abuse.shtml</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Is there any CLI centric channel on Freenode?</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">try joining #bash?</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">That&#39;s pretty counterproductive ;)</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">Although if you go to one of the Linux rooms they might be helpful</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Considering I am trying to move away from Bash</saying>
<saying who="SigSegOwl">so there is no way to connect dvi or dp to hdmi ?</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Ask in ##hardware ?</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">SigSegOwl&gt; Without a converter, probably not...</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Era_Scarecrow: heh, funny link</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">rindolf&gt; Go back one level and there&#39;s ALL TYPES of topics.. programming, hardware, scammers... techno mumbo jumbo no one else understands :P</saying>
<saying who="usr123">Is there a competitive programming channel on freenode?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">usr123: you can discuss it here</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">usr123&gt; Hmmm maybe... Can&#39;t get more competitive than say CRobots though</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">usr123: problem is there are many CP sites</saying>
<saying who="SigSegOwl">see ya later then :D heading to work...</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">SigSegOwl: hooooo</saying>
<saying who="usr123">Well. I did post my code. I just can&#39;t figure out the corner case I might be missing.</saying>
<saying who="l2y">usr123: try #algorithms</saying>
<saying who="usr123">l2y: Thanks. on it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Era_Scarecrow: ah</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">I don&#39;t know what channels there are, because when i go to look over the list of channels or search through them.... there&#39;s so many and my client isn&#39;t very good at searching channel lists, so hope you have the exact title of something...</saying>
<saying who="l2y">Era_Scarecrow: this is easy. you just Google &quot;irc &lt;yourtopic&gt;&quot;, then find the first crawler, look at the number of members, and if it&#39;s legit, join</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">l2y&gt; Maybe. I&#39;ve also just joined rooms to see if they are empty or not :P</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">Here it&#39;s midnight... i should sleep soon</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Era_Scarecrow: i stayed up all night refactoring old CSS stylesheets</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">fun...</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Era_Scarecrow: i ended up reducing the codebase by close to a thousand lines</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Sass!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: no sass yet</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">fun fun. I got a script for reducing the size of a differential data backup up and running</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: i just consolidated the CSS directives</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Sass changes lives :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Era_Scarecrow: great</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: i like sass</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">yeah... the big pain in the butt was trying to get diff and patch to work on potentially differing newline types, without it replacing whole files just because it was \n instead of \r\n lines or whatever</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: ah, are you a fan of the sriracha sauce?</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">rindolf: sure am ;)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: ah , i like it too</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Era_Scarecrow: i see</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Mostly because if that Garlic</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">*of</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Era_Scarecrow: i use individual tarballs for backups</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Era_Scarecrow: i have a 1 tb ext hard disk</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Era_Scarecrow: and i exclude various large dirs that i don't need backed up</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">mhmm... i have a backup script that runs every 6 hours taking files newer than my last backup and saving it, means the files are about 3Mb per backup per day. then when i get around to plugging in my other drive, just copy the backups and I&#39;m golden.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Era_Scarecrow: ah</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">but when i run my script, i can remove unnecessary inclusions cutting the size down to something like 100k, and then with diff/patch, down to 60k per day</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Well you can use rsync</saying>
<saying who="bavi">gah... i was talking down the dark hallway and accidentally kicked/stepped-on the cat and one of her incisors went right into my heel</saying>
<saying who="bavi">s/talking/walking :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bavi: :(</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">And that&#39;s why folks use your phone&#39;s LED</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">Fries&gt; Not sure how I&#39;d use it, as this is the only running computer in the house right now...</saying>
<saying who="bavi">she is fine though :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bavi: ah</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">bavi: Ohhh, the ways in which cats can educate us about their ways ... =)</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Era_Scarecrow: oh</saying>
<saying who="bavi">now she has the zoomies</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bavi: you should have got a fluorescent cat</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">I&#39;ll totally get cats again when I have kids. *pull* - &quot;Don&#39;t pull its tail!&quot; - *pull* - &quot;DON&#39;T PULL ITS TAIL!&quot; - *pull* -- *claw* -- *cry* - &quot;I told you not to pull its tail!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="bavi">hah</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">http://theoatmeal.com/comics/cat_kill</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bavi: there was this manx kitten who was born with metallic green fur</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">rindolf: Heh. We had a cafe across a place I used to work to. They had a waitress who brought her big black dog in (looked like a golden retriever, except it was pitch black; are there pitch-black retrievers?) ... I suggested she could dye some fluorescent racing stripes into its fur. :D</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bavi: i saw a photo of him in the newspaper</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">FriesAndSriracha: I actually still have to read that book. :S</saying>
<saying who="hio">rindolf, what is a MUST HAVE feature for a programming language?</saying>
<saying who="bavi">rindolf: that&#39;s cool :)</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">SlashLife^work: same situation here ;)</saying>
<saying who="bavi">integers</saying>
<saying who="hio">i personally really enjoy the automatic typing in typescript where a struct automatically gets a type if it fits the interface. I think it&#39;s called duck typing but not entirely sure</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">FriesAndSriracha: Also have it lying around already? x)</saying>
<saying who="hio">i mean it makes perfect sense, if some data structure has the exact same fields as an interface that i defined then just let it have that type immediately</saying>
<saying who="hio">it&#39;s not duck typing because you still have to cast in Typescript</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">hio: see http://shlomif-tech.livejournal.com/57811.html</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Any point in learning Golang now?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: to hack on golang projects</saying>
<saying who="hio">rindolf, i don't subscribe to this middle of the road crap &quot;everything sux, get over it&quot; attitude. There is right and wrong in the world, period</saying>
<saying who="hio">&quot;You are damned either way, whatever you do.&quot; &lt;-- very stupid attitude to have</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">hio: And C++ is on the right side ... mostly. :D</saying>
<saying who="hio">c++ is just about the worst possible language that can exist</saying>
<saying who="Era_Scarecrow">My current languages of choice, include AHK and D...</saying>
<saying who="hio">hit me with some new and exciting c++ features, I&#39;m sure they are ridiculously complex and useless</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Google is a LLC now?</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">hio: I need a toolbox that gets the job done, not a crate full of useless, but exciting, gimmicks.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">hio: what is better: English, Hebrew, French, German, Arabic, Spanish, Swahili, Japanese, Mandarin, ...</saying>
<saying who="hio">German</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">I&#39;ll take a screwdriver over a fidget spinner every day.</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Also another language I&#39;ve been hearing about is Haskell</saying>
<saying who="hio">Haskell is a toy language, people only use it when they want to appear smart</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Can we do server side coding with it?</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">FriesAndSriracha: You can do server side coding with almost every language.</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">FriesAndSriracha: If it can do console I/O on any modern OS, it can do server side web.</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">SlashLife^work: I know that but is it a popular or niche thing , that&#39;s the question</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">FriesAndSriracha: Look up CGI. :D</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">FriesAndSriracha: I know people who use Haskell for web.</saying>
<saying who="hio">i mean look at this thing in c++: &quot;auto glambda = [](auto a, auto&amp;&amp; b) { return a &lt; b; };&quot;.. what&#39;s with the random array []? What is the array here???</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">hio: we are not talking in German, are we?</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">I don&#39;t think they based their whole server side stack on it, though ... but I actually don&#39;t know.</saying>
<saying who="hio">rindolf, we don't live in a perfect world, do we?</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">hio: It&#39;s not an array. It&#39;s an empty capture.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">hio: no.</saying>
<saying who="hio">great that we worked that out</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">So this means there&#39;s no big projects using Haskell?</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">hio: So you&#39;re complaining that [] can have three different meanings?</saying>
<saying who="hio">yes</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">hio: Good luck with () then.</saying>
<saying who="hio">() only has one meaning</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">It does?</saying>
<saying who="hio">yes, it means group up</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">hio: German has three genders, and some inanimate objects are male or female - like wtf?</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">int x = foo(); double y = (2.0/3.0); int z = (int)y; ... I was thinking of at least one more a moment ago.</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Sorry guys, I was just a web developer, took a long break and now trying to get into coding again</saying>
<saying who="hio">it still all means &quot;group up&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="hio">even the cast</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">hio: and a damsel is neuter</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">hio: BS</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">hio: Oh, the [] always means &quot;index&quot;</saying>
<saying who="hio">it never means that wow</saying>
<saying who="hio">int[10] does not mean index</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: what do you wish to do?</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">rindolf: mostly to learn some kinda language</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: ah</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">I know, HTML and CSS, and shell scripting</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">Either that something can have indices (void foo(int[])), or that something *has* indices (int arr[32]), or that you want to access an index (int x = arr[3]), or which indices from the current scope you want to capture (auto lambda = [arr,&amp;x](){ x = *arr; })</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: ah</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">And can use git</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: ah.</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">But that&#39;s about it it her than by basic understanding of JavaScript</saying>
<saying who="xqb">hi helloz</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: can you write fizz buzz?</saying>
<saying who="hio">OK SlashLife^work, so it &quot;accesses&quot; variables inside the current scope as if the scope is an array. That&#39;s a complex way of seeing it but fine</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xqb: mew</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">s/her/other</saying>

<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">rindolf: oh Tom Scott made a video about it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: about what?</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">FizzBuzz I mean</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: ah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: see https://github.com/shlomif/Freenode-programming-channel-FAQ/blob/master/FAQ.mdwn#what-is-fizzbuzz</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Whose GitHub page is this?</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Lotsa nice info ;)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: someone i tutored was able to solve fizz buzz after the first few lessons</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: i am shlomif on gh</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Oh nice :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: there were some other contributors to the faq</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: and it may be somewhat opinionated</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Thanks for this, I&#39;ve been out of this whole things for so long</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: thanks</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: you&#39;re welcome</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">I think getting into Python would be a good idea</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: i think so too</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: python is easy to learn</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">rindolf: yep I am kinda stuck between what to learn, to be honest</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: ah, i know that feeling</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">People are suggesting Python, Ruby, Go...</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">I vote for Python.</saying>
<saying who="xqb">hi etc</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">and even JavaScript</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">High? i am not!</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Node I mean</saying>
<saying who="squirrel">oops wrong chan</saying>
<saying who="mozzarella">I vote for ruby</saying>
<saying who="xqb">:) /me hi5s vdamewood</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">FriesAndSriracha: What do you already know?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: it reminds me of the philosophical dog that stands in equal distance between two identical piles of food and ends up starving to death</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">puts mozzarella on FriesAndSriracha and eats them both</me_is>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">I was a web developer, so no programming language, HTML, CASE, Shell scripting etc</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">rindolf: share!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vdamewood: :)</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">CASE? (Typo of CSS?)</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">s/CASE/CSS</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">vdamewood: autocorrect actually</saying>
<saying who="xqb">that&#39;s Buridan's donkey</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: ah</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">Hey look, someone who doesn&#39;t think HTML is a programming language.</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">rindolf: I know how that dog feels ;)</saying>
<saying who="xqb">it is a donkey</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vdamewood: writing HTML is kinda programming though</saying>
<me_is who="vdamewood">kicks the donkey.</me_is>
<saying who="vdamewood">It&#39;s time to kick ass!</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">rindolf: I don&#39;t believe it it as all.</saying>
<saying who="xqb">heh</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: :)</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Oh and basic Unix tools, and Git</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">That&#39;s all I know</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: OK, then learn python</saying>
<saying who="xqb">+1 py</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Seems reasonable</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">FriesAndSriracha: If you&#39;re looking for suggestions of real a real programming language to learn, go with Python. it has Django and Flask.</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">I prefer Django.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">and bottle</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">But Ruby has Rails and Sinatra too ;)</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">Ruby is also not Python.</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">Which is a point against Ruby.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: the ruby hype seems to have mostly passed away</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">Though, Python, Ruby, and Java are all fine languages for beginners. Python is just slightly better.</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">rindolf: I know people are hyping Golang now</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">Everything else is terrible for beginners.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: and rust</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">Golang is also on my terrible-for-beginners list.</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">And Kotlin maybe</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: and node.js</saying>
<saying who="xqb">when I was starting, I was looking up how the same program (was it hello world?) looks like in different languages</saying>
<saying who="xqb">I found C#&#39;s syntax to be the most appealing to me</saying>
<saying who="xqb">so I went with C# :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xqb: OK</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">xqb: Probably. Hello world is fairly popular for language juxtaposition.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">the first language is always the hardest to learn</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">I can&#39;t really go with C#</saying>
<saying who="xqb">!fgoogle juxtaposition</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">I doubt it runs on Linux</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: it does</saying>
<saying who="xqb">it does but not as expected</saying>
<saying who="xqb">Mono is crap</saying>
<saying who="xqb">and you can&#39;t do WPF</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: even .NET core from Microsoft</saying>
<saying who="xqb">and 100+ things</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Python it is then ;)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: sure</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">xqb: justa- next to/besides. juxtoposition: to position next to/beside; to compare by placing side by side.</saying>
<saying who="l2y">FriesAndSriracha: it runs on Linux, and does so rather well as of today</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">s/justa/juxta/</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">l2y: I mostly wanna do Server site coding</saying>
<saying who="xqb">thanks :)</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">Well, Juxtaposition means the act as a noun. The verb is juxtapose.</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">s/site/side</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Thanks a lot rindolf again!</saying>
<saying who="l2y">FriesAndSriracha: OK, whatever. just proving you wrong, so that you don&#39;t doubt any more</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Also thanks vdamewood</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">Bah, I didn&#39;t so anything significant.</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">l2y: oh I didn&#39;t know</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: you&#39;re welcome</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">rindolf: I think you should also include Video tutorials in your Python resources</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">I want to teach some stuff now.</saying>
<me_is who="xqb">&#39;d like to know what is unit testing and how do I start writing tests and what&#39;s a good read for testing</me_is>
<saying who="vdamewood">xqb: Unit testing is when you write code that makes your other code works properly. For example, if you have a function called addtwo(x), you would write a functions like this: a = addtwo(3); if a == 5, return true; else return false;</saying>
<saying who="xqb">what&#39;s a unit in my code? a function/method?</saying>
<saying who="xqb">a .. line?</saying>
<saying who="xqb">what</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">A separate program.</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">Well, it could also be a function or collection of functions.</saying>
<saying who="xqb">I&#39;m testing a separate program in my program?</saying>
<saying who="xqb">why don&#39;t I test my program directly?</saying>
<saying who="mozzarella">nigga</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">You&#39;re not testing your program; you&#39;re testing parts (units) of your program.</saying>
<saying who="mozzarella">return a == 5</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">If I really wanted to go that fare: return addtwo(3) == 5</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">far*</saying>
<saying who="mozzarella">well you should</saying>
<saying who="xqb">assert addtwo(3) == 5</saying>
<saying who="xqb">and then I run pytest in the background</saying>
<saying who="xqb">and I&#39;ve tested a unit?</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">xqb: That might work, but it doesn&#39;t look like PyTest is specifically for Unit testing.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: you&#39;re welcome</saying>
<saying who="xqb">I see</saying>
<saying who="xqb">is TDD (Kent Beck) a good book?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xqb: quite</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xqb: most of it is redundant</saying>
<saying who="xqb">I know what you think rindolf, you&#39;re the one who recommended it :P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xqb: ah</saying>
<saying who="PlanckWalk">A &quot;unit&quot; is generally an internal API contract.  Often a function or method.</saying>
<saying who="xqb">what&#39;s an API contract</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xqb: i can recommend against a different one - https://mail.perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2010-April/010909.html</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mozzarella: yes</saying>
<saying who="PlanckWalk">A specification for how one part of a system can use another.</saying>
<saying who="xqb">I see</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Oh that reminds me of this site https://hackr.io/</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">xqb: Many unit-testing frameworks follow the design of a Java unit-testing framework called JUnit. Though, this isn&#39;t strictly required, it sure does help organize things.</saying>

<saying who="Jasparon">Hello friends:</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: meow</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">Do programmers care about logic gates, or do I need to study EE/CE?</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">rindolf: Long time no C</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: we do</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">rindolf: Who is we?</saying>
<saying who="brwr">Jasparon: programmers who work with logic gates care about logic gates :)</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">Gtg</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: there are bitwise and logical operators</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">Uggggh....</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FriesAndSriracha: bye</saying>
<saying who="FriesAndSriracha">rindolf: see ya</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">Suppose I want to get into how logic gates design works (theory), and I one day want to build custom circuits.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: i am a software dev who studied EE/CEish</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">Should I get an intro electronics book; or an intro circuits book?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: and graduated</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">Ok sure</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">:)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: well, not sure i can call what i studied CE</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">rindolf: Right.</saying>
<saying who="brwr">Jasparon: IME its better to find a project that interests you and start working on it</saying>
<saying who="brwr">YMMV</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: it is technically EE proper, but calling me an electrical engineer would be a stretch</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">IME?</saying>
<saying who="brwr">I find books helpful for things like design patterns and best practices, but not for code</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">brwr: I know, but I want to learn how electronics work, and how computer electronics work</saying>
<saying who="brwr">rts-sander: in my experience</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: the Technion is funny</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">rindolf: Maybe you&#39;re just a electronics-competent programmer?</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">brwr: ah I see, I thought it was misspelled IMO</saying>
<saying who="brwr">Jasparon: +1</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: i am clueless around electronics</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">brwr: Ok neat</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">brwr: Well, would you recommend I get: 1. Intro CE book. 2. Intro electronics. 3. Intro circuits? Which one?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: they never showed us how to replace a lightbulb</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: wait a sec</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">rindolf: 0, because it&#39;s a hardware issue</saying>
<saying who="brwr">Jasparon: i don’t know enough about electronics to make a recommendation. Sorry!</saying>
<saying who="FMan">morning</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/computation-structures - this book is nice</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: and there is also http://www.nand2tetris.org/</saying>
<saying who="brwr">IRC on mobile is sadface</saying>
<saying who="brwr">I get disconnected if I turn my screen off</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: i suggest you start from a high level prog lang</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: something like python</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: how good is your math?</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">rindolf: So, I know about formal logic enough to know things like De Morgan&#39;s, but I still need to take college algebra</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">Thanks for the books</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: you&#39;re welcome</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">rindolf: Here is a good question:</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: logic can get pretty complicated and impractical</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">Really?</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">What&#39;s a good place to build objects? I think main?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: at least the one that is under active research</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">What&#39;s under active research?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: you can also build them int he methods of other objects</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: logic</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">correct. I think it&#39;s &quot;not good&quot; to create objects in the instance-scope?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: why not?</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">rindolf: I tried constructing an instance of my class, in the instance-level in Java; stackoverflow</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: otherwise you&#39;ll have a cluttered main func</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">Makes sense</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: ah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: you need to limit your recursion</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">rindolf: Right. But I was so confused because my constructor was empty.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: or use iterative tree recursion with a dedicated stack</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">Good idea</saying>
<saying who="mvaenskae">hm, low level detail question on C&#39;s memory allocation; if i request 200MB of memory via malloc will that be virtual-addressed memory or real memory locations?</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">rindolf: I should be going :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jasparon: where?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mvaenskae: hi</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mvaenskae: it depends where the program is running\</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">Heehee...</saying>
<saying who="Jasparon">GTG :)</saying>
<saying who="mvaenskae">rindolf: hm, in kernel mode it would then get the bare memory locations i take</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mvaenskae: possibly</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mvaenskae: kernel code does not have malloc() usually</saying>
<me_is who="mvaenskae">ponders on reworking the sorting algos to not work with explicit arrays but a struct of linked/doubly-linked lists...</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">mvaenskae: at least the Linux kernel doesn't</saying>
<saying who="mvaenskae">hm, i could obviously adapt that to get the proper Linux kernel function but it could still fail due to fragmentation in allocation a large enough section</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mvaenskae: heh</saying>
<saying who="mvaenskae">but i just realized my approach doesn&#39;t scale to structs to pointers to the next element, only to arrays of structs</saying>
<saying who="l2y">mvaenskae: is your allocations are not enormous, kernel won&#39;t move a page from virtual memory to disk, and virtual memory provides constant time access, so, why bother?</saying>
<saying who="l2y">s/is/if/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mvaenskae: small optimisations can add up to a lot, but if your program can afford to be sub-optimally slower, then so be it</saying>
<saying who="mvaenskae">rindolf: i don&#39;t so much care for performance than for stability; people somewhat OK in C should be able to understand how I approached different sorting algos within the constraints of C in the most generic way and can use them for their own projects about as easily as importing my stuff</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mvaenskae: see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Optimizing_Code_for_Speed/Factor_Optimizations#Are_%22Small%22_Optimizations_Desirable?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mvaenskae: stability?</saying>
<saying who="mvaenskae">if it comes to just speed and i have a fixed interface i would have just commenced; i just realized my approach is not the most generic one</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mvaenskae: if you want your program to behave then keep it out of the kernel</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Morning</saying>
<saying who="mvaenskae">l2y: i was mostly thinking of the problems on fragmentation :)</saying>
<saying who="mvaenskae">rindolf: why keep it out of the kernel?</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">rindolf: sup?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mvaenskae: because code running in kernel land can do untold damage\</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: i refactored some CSS stylesheets</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: shaved a thousand lines</saying>
<saying who="mvaenskae">rindolf: well, it&#39;s the kernel :) i expect nothing less of the system than request a sacrifice to boot again if i break it ;)</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">rindolf: Do you use CSS normalization libraries?</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">rindolf: Wow!</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Nice</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: no</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">whitespace lines? :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: it is for my talks at http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: the quad-pres ones</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rts-sander: no</saying>
<saying who="l2y">mvaenskae: again, what can you do about it? nothing. malloc already allocates a contiguous block of memory, if you are in a kernel space, which you should never be in, you don&#39;t have malloc. you are provided with an interface and are bound to what the interface reveals about itself</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">rindolf: I don&#39;t know if you need this, but it&#39;s used by Twitter, GitHub and more: https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: i had done a lot of copying and tweaking</saying>
<saying who="mvaenskae">l2y: i may to do kernel development ;) and i wanted to clarify the memory pages returned :) i assumed them to be VA but it&#39;s early in the morning and i wasn&#39;t fully awake to properly recall :)</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Neat</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: ah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: it was bad</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">I can imagine.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: i had to consolidate my directives</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">What directives?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: the css ones</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">You mean like :hover and stuff?</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Not sure I know what css directives are.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">The ones with the @?</saying>
<saying who="mvaenskae">right now only userland and there i have now been verified how malloc works :) my aim is trying to eventually be able to write C code that is as generic as possible</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: see https://github.com/shlomif/shlomi-fish-homepage/commits/master</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: no</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: i mean regular rules like b { color: red; }</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Ah.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">That&#39;s a lot of commits :D</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: yes</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: the site dates back to 1997ish</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Wow.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: but i used svn-&gt;hg-&gt;git for it relatively later</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">What&#39;s that?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: first i used svn</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: then moved to hg</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">and finally git</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Ah those are versioning systems?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Rashad: yes</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">I see I see.</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">looks like you finally did git gud</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rts-sander: the main reason why i switched it to github was travis-ci</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rts-sander: well, and hg does not seem to become more popular</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">never heard of hg</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rts-sander: heh</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">rindolf: but do you like git itself more than the other systems?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rts-sander: it isn't too bad, but has its share of quirks</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rts-sander: not sure</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rts-sander: i still kinda miss the simplicity of the svn model. i don't feel i understand git</saying>
<saying who="velco">Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">git is too complicated the only thing I use is push and pull</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">morning velco</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">I&#39;ve gotten decently proficient in git</saying>
<saying who="vendu">yo :)</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">rindolf: do you also have experience with version control software in team settings or just solo projects?</saying>
<saying who="velco">git is love, git is life</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rts-sander: also in teams</saying>
<saying who="velco">(that said, I was pretty happy with Mercurial too)</saying>
<saying who="vendu">rts-sander, i haven&#39;t :)</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">svn broke more often than not when I tried it with other people</saying>
<saying who="velco">one does not have to understand git</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rts-sander: git rebase can be a bitch too</saying>
<saying who="velco">one needs to know just enough of it, in order to accommodate their workflow</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">velco: well, git threw me off quite a lot</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">if you have a lot of conflicts yeah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">velco: good thing there is #git here</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">git is advanced but there&#39;s no simplicity layer</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">users are thrown right into the deep</saying>
<saying who="Rashad">Yeah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">velco: https://xkcd.com/1597/</saying>
<saying who="velco">rindolf, without clicking it, I know what it is :D</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">velco: :)</saying>
<saying who="velco">but just clone/checkout/push/pull/branch/rebase are sufficient to 99.937% if what I need to happen</saying>
<saying who="velco">s/if/of/</saying>
<saying who="velco">cherry-pick too</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">velco: commit</saying>
<saying who="velco">haha, yeah</saying>
<saying who="velco">log</saying>
<saying who="velco">diff</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">deletes velco &#39;s git-commit script</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">welcome to hell</saying>
<me_is who="velco">restores git worktree from the backup</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">lets do a pull req on git&#39;s git to remove git-commit</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">velco: git bisect is also useful</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">lol I actually did that when I was a git noob</saying>
<saying who="merijn">rts-sander: The simplicity layer of git is &quot;Just use Mercurial&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">back then the team I worked with worked on Windows and we had problems with file name case sensitivity</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">merijn: hg threw me off too</saying>
<saying who="merijn">rindolf: How so?</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">merijn: meh once you learn git it&#39;s good</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">merijn: don't remember</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">merijn: and i hate its heads misfeature</saying>
<saying who="wwwwww">is it generally correct to say that jump instructions modify the program counter the same way an add instruction might modify a normal register?</saying>
<saying who="merijn">rts-sander: Yeah, but why would I bother when I already knows Mercurial and it&#39;s so much simpler to learn? :)</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">merijn: good point, there&#39;s no reason to learn something more complex when you already have something that works</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">that&#39;s why I&#39;m not going through the effort of learning Haskell :D</saying>
<saying who="merijn">I don&#39;t think git is even that much more complex than mercurial</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rts-sander: heh</saying>
<saying who="merijn">It just has really shit UI/UX</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">UI? heh I just use the cmd line</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">merijn: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better perhaps</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rts-sander: cmd line is ui too</saying>
<saying who="merijn">rts-sander: I&#39;m referring to the cmd line</saying>
<saying who="merijn">UI is UI, graphical or not</saying>
<saying who="loginoob">Is it really true that to learn some language, try to build something that one have no idea how to start</saying>
<saying who="loginoob">in that language</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">loginoob: i never did that</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">loginoob: perhaps try to contribute to an existing codebase</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">ah, I assumed UI = GUI</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">yeah I agree it&#39;s confusing at times</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">for example git checkout -- path, git checkout branchname, git checkout -b newbranch all do something completely different</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rts-sander: also see http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=djb-on-cmd-interfaces</saying>
<saying who="merijn">rts-sander: I think this summarises it accurately: http://stevelosh.com/media/images/blog/2010/01/mercurial-vs-git.jpg</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">merijn: heh</saying>
<saying who="loginoob">git is easy until you fuck up</saying>
<saying who="merijn">loginoob: Then you just Google and copy&amp;paste cryptic lines from blogposts until either all your data is gone or it&#39;s fixed :p</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">oh hg = mercurial lol</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">GAHHH! OCD!! &gt;_&lt;&quot;</saying>
<saying who="loginoob">true</saying>
<saying who="merijn">rts-sander: Because nobody wants to type a command as long as &quot;mercurial&quot; :p</saying>
<saying who="loginoob">merry: You are a haskeller right?</saying>
<saying who="loginoob">shit</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife^work">I have a directory, an archive and an executable, all by the name of &quot;qt-&quot; in subsequent lines on the same terminal. &quot;ls&quot; colored them blue, red and green respectively ...</saying>

<saying who="SlashLife^work">... which means they do not perfectly line up because they use different subpixels.</saying>

<saying who="snake2k">birkoff, a simple linear search algorithm if you&#39;re not gonna sort it</saying>
<saying who="vesc">Birkoff: If you are sorting you can do it quicker than N.</saying>
<saying who="snake2k">birkoff, you&#39;d be better off implemented a fast sorting algorithm and picking the first (or last) value off the array.</saying>
<saying who="birkoff">vesc interesting. how ? I'm not sorting though.</saying>
<saying who="day">snake2k: sorting is faster than N?</saying>
<saying who="vesc">I agree with snake2k</saying>
<saying who="snake2k">day, if it&#39;s a massive array, then yes</saying>
<saying who="day">but how can you sort without having to look at each element?</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">wtf kind of shit advice is that</saying>
<saying who="snake2k">day, the time complexity of checking each N to the next can scale larger depending on array size. But a highly optimized sort can cut the time down.</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">sort the entire array just to get one value?</saying>
<saying who="day">snake2k: but then it wouldn't be O(n) any more would it?</saying>
<saying who="snake2k">I&#39;m not saying to use a basic sorting algorithm because that&#39;s pointless lmao</saying>
<saying who="vesc">rts-sander: what would you do?</saying>
<saying who="snake2k">you&#39;d be better off with just a linear search</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">vesc, loop through and remember the highest encountered number</saying>
<saying who="day">yeah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">snake2k: sort cannot be better than o(n)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">snake2k: see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">unless the array is already sorted, then it&#39;s O(1) :)</saying>
<saying who="vesc">rts-sander: the best you could get is O(n) I know a sort cand be done better than that.</saying>
<saying who="vesc">can*</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">snake2k: and it is O(N*log(N)) worst case</saying>
<saying who="rts-sander">vesc, how can sorting an entire array possibly be faster than finding the largest value?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rts-sander: you need to know that is the case</saying>
<saying who="vesc">because you need to know what the largest value is</saying>

<saying who="AbleBacon">that&#39;s not similar... it doesn&#39;t have an elaborate license explicitly stated in the code file</saying>
<saying who="iodev">rindolf, well, i can do whatever I want with it, Fibonacci is public domain, you can&#39;t MIT it, if I wanna use it in proprietary software, I can</saying>

<saying who="G3nka1">I know rindolf</saying>
<saying who="iodev">rindolf, anyway, you see, before you MIT/GPL something you must having something Original, that is the copyrighted thing :D</saying>
<saying who="iodev">if anyone can make it, just like anyone can make a stool, no patent, no copyright is given, because you&#39;re not the author of anything, rindolf</saying>

<saying who="GeDaMo">Turbo Pascal :P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">GeDaMo: where?</saying>
<saying who="Aruseus">many modern language features are slow to compile. rust has that problem too</saying>
<saying who="InPhase">Fast compilation, fast development, fast runtime.  Choose 2.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">InPhase: heh</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">InPhase: 2 or less</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">rindolf: that was to beaky&#39;s &quot;instant compile speeds&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">GeDaMo: ah</saying>
<saying who="InPhase">There&#39;s a fundamental reason one ends up with that trade-off of choosing 2.  Turning complicated ideas into fast instructions is complicated.  And that complexity has to eventually be processed somewhere, either in the head of the programmer, by the compiler, or as a runtime cost.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">InPhase: interesting</saying>
<saying who="_W_">most slow compilers are so, not because it is necessary, but simply because making it fast hasn&#39;t been a priority</saying>
<saying who="_W_">s/so/slow</saying>
<saying who="InPhase">_W_: Well the major C++ compiler designers, and the C++ language committee, reportedly spent effort trying to significantly speed up compilation in recent years.  But I think we can see there were not many meaningful results from those efforts.  They&#39;ve had trouble finding ways that don&#39;t majorly break the features that make the C++ runtime fast.</saying>
<saying who="xeno">if I don&#39;t learn how to read a file line by line in Swift, this one will also be slow, memory consuming or unstable ;/</saying>
<saying who="xeno">:/</saying>
<saying who="_W_">well C++ compilation is already relatively fast, so it makes sense that there wouldn&#39;t be a lot to gain</saying>
<saying who="jeaye">There have been huge results in the reduction of TMP compilation speeds, thanks to pressure from the clang/llvm world.</saying>
<saying who="jeaye">Templates, of course, being the biggest practical slowdown in C++ compilation, that&#39;s a big win.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">jeaye: what is TMP?</saying>
<saying who="jeaye">rindolf: Template MetaProgramming</saying>
<saying who="_W_">I&#39;d go so far as to say that there&#39;s more of a correlation between how young a language is and how slow its compilation is, than between complexity of language and how slow the compilation is</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">jeaye: ah</saying>
<saying who="SlashLife">jeaye: And to be fair, I don&#39;t think it was obvious 20-25 years ago how big TMP would become.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">_W_: some languages started off with fast compilers</saying>
<saying who="_W_">yes, it&#39;s not a hard rule by any means</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">_W_: and gcc got slower - https://github.com/shlomif/fc-solve/blob/master/fc-solve/docs/gcc-2.95.txt</saying>
<saying who="gehn">fast in terms of time to compile? or fast in terms of the performance of the resulting executable?</saying>
<saying who="_W_">gehn: time spent in compilation was what was being discussed</saying>
<saying who="_W_">(and contrasted up against speed of development and speed of execution)</saying>
<saying who="gehn">ah</saying>
<saying who="xeno">would guess most languages started off with fast compilers that got slower</saying>
<saying who="_W_">probably, at least up to some level of complexity and features</saying>
<saying who="velco">speed of development is subjective, its place is not at all with the other too</saying>
<saying who="velco">two*</saying>
<saying who="gehn">compile time is certainly something that impacts dev time</saying>
<saying who="gehn">at least in my experience</saying>
<saying who="gehn">I like C++, but I don&#39;t love everything about it. it would be nice if we had significantly faster C++ compile times</saying>
<saying who="velco">in my experience, it does impact time taken only when not writing code</saying>
<saying who="gehn">well, testing the code written is a pretty important and continuous process of my development</saying>
<saying who="gehn">I have unit tests, but those don&#39;t cover everything</saying>
<saying who="gehn">and GUIs are often more difficult to test at all</saying>
<saying who="gehn">especially difficult to test things like the result of a render operation on an OpenGL context</saying>
<saying who="gehn">so, needing to wait a significant amount of time (upwards of a minute or several) just to test some fairly simple change can spiral time-to-dev costs</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gehn: yes</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gehn: using ccache has changed my life</saying>
<saying who="velco">what percentage of this time is spent compiling? and what is spent analysing the issue, coming up with a solution, implementing the solution, writing a test, code review, running the test?</saying>
<saying who="gehn">rindolf, is that different from how a Makefile or whatever (or a cmake generated project) should be able to detect which files need compile and which don&#39;t?</saying>
<saying who="gehn">velco, like I said, it&#39;s not always feasible to write a test for everything</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gehn: sometimes it is</saying>
<saying who="gehn">I don&#39;t have an answer as to exact percentage, but on many days I suspect I spend almost 50% of my total time waiting for compiles</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gehn: if you did make clean for example</saying>
<saying who="velco">gehn: Sure. Why do you feel compelled to tell this to me?</saying>
<saying who="gehn">that might be an overestimate, but it&#39;s not far away</saying>
<saying who="Aruseus">gehn, if you have a file b that depends on a. if you change a, then you&#39;ll need to recompile b even if you didn&#39;t change it at all. so probably not everything will change</saying>
<saying who="gehn">velco, were you not asking the percentage question as a response to what I had said?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">obxkcd: https://www.xkcd.com/303/</saying>
<me_is who="goiko_">has quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)</me_is>
<saying who="gehn">unit tests help a lot</saying>
<me_is who="Mutex7">(~Mutex7@S010620e52a28896a.wp.shawcable.net) has joined</me_is>
<saying who="velco">gehn: yes, and if you don&#39;t write test, my list potentially incomplete list of things allows for a 0 percent</saying>
<saying who="gehn">because they compile much faster as each unit is typically decoupled from the entire app</saying>
<me_is who="goiko__">(~goiko@pD95836BC.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined</me_is>
<me_is who="geste__">(~geste@pd95b0b70.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined</me_is>
<saying who="velco">gehn: sound like you need to rethink your workflow</saying>
<saying who="gehn">velco, sorry I don&#39;t understand what you just said</saying>
<saying who="gehn">velco, maybe, but I&#39;m not sure what to change about said workflow</saying>
<saying who="velco">gehn: I have not put a restriction of non-zero time on any particular item in my list, so I don&#39;t understand why do you need to tell me some of these may take zero time</saying>
<saying who="gehn">so, it&#39;s great to write unit tests, and I write a lot of them, but when doing more GUI centric integration centric work - a workflow centered around unit tests isn&#39;t viable</saying>
<saying who="gehn">velco, I seriously still don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re saying?</saying>
<saying who="gehn">when did I say anything about zero time?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gehn: there is also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distcc</saying>
<saying who="gehn">velco, yes, what about that statement?</saying>
<saying who="velco">I have found that a a simple change incurs less than 2 minutes of building of a large c++ project, most of it spent in linking</saying>
<saying who="gehn">2 minutes is still kind of a lot</saying>
<saying who="gehn">I tend to not write tons of code before recompiling and testing</saying>
<saying who="gehn">so I might spend anywhere from 30s to 5 minutes on a few lines, and then I usually want to test again before moving on</saying>
<saying who="gehn">with unit tests where compilation and runtime is usually &lt; 20-30s that&#39;s mostly not an issue</saying>
<saying who="gehn">but when compile times start to rise above the minute-or-several mark, then this begins to become more of a problematic issue</saying>
<saying who="velco">why run compilation and test so often?</saying>
<saying who="gehn">I think the answer to that should be fairly clear to many if not most devs</saying>
<saying who="velco">I run it when I have written a committable amount of code</saying>
<saying who="exio4_noznc">velco: fail early</saying>
<saying who="gehn">the more lines of code you write the more chance that you&#39;ve made a mistake, and the further you go without checking your work, the more likely it is you&#39;ll end up in a very difficult to debug situation that consumes more time than it should</saying>
<saying who="velco">exio4_noznc: it looks to me that some fail even before starting :P</saying>
<saying who="gde33">shouldn&#39;t make mistakes</saying>
<saying who="gehn">linting helps with that a lot</saying>
<saying who="gehn">but still doesn&#39;t prevent logic or runtime errors</saying>
<saying who="velco">gehn: that does not come form my experience; it is very rare I have an error in each line I write</saying>
<saying who="gehn">so I guess velco is a near god-like perfect programmer</saying>
<saying who="velco">in fact, most are correct; hence, testing them in isolation proves pointless</saying>
<saying who="gehn">for the rest of us mortals however...</saying>
<saying who="gehn">I don&#39;t test lines in isolation</saying>

<saying who="mrig">often wondered why a list of objects is called a vector in C++ too, seems some how related.</saying>

<saying who="velco">that&#39;s he original mathematical definition of vector: tuple of scalars</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">mrig: So the term was borrowed in the old days by some. Some others uses &#39;array&#39; for the term.</saying>

<saying who="zenix_2k2">so someone here advised me to compile my program on Windows 10 and it is gonna work backward on the other versions, but when i run on Windows 8 it says something like &quot;api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll is missing&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">zenix_2k2: i recall similar issues</saying>
<saying who="zenix_2k2">and i was trying to compile the program with pyinstaller</saying>
<saying who="Arahael">zenix_2k2: You need to find the redistributable for the libraries you&#39;re using, and install them.  Looks like windows 10 has it by default.</saying>
<saying who="zenix_2k2">more like freezing it</saying>
<saying who="Arahael">zenix_2k2: That said, the convention in most environments is to get the *oldest* environment you want to support, and use that.</saying>
<saying who="Arahael">zenix_2k2: Older apps tend to work well on newer systems.  The reverse is not usually true.</saying>
<saying who="deniska">zenix_2k2: when compiling for compatibility, you probably would want to go with older systems rather than newer</saying>
<saying who="zenix_2k2">well, maybe i will just compile on Windows 8 and hopefully it will work on win10 and win7</saying>
<saying who="deniska">(not sure how it works on windows though)</saying>
<saying who="Arahael">zenix_2k2: In that case, compile on windows 7.</saying>
<saying who="deniska">if you want to target win7, you probably should use win7</saying>
<saying who="zenix_2k2">that&#39;s weird, some people here said i should have compiled on win10</saying>
<saying who="zenix_2k2">it is gonna work backward</saying>
<saying who="zenix_2k2">or maybe i lagged :P</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">Windows 7 is EOL in 7 months.</saying>
<saying who="zenix_2k2">well... but i bet its apps will still work on windows 10 and 8</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">zenix_2k2: Compiling for Windows 7 on Windows 10 should, in theory work, as long as you only use libraries that come with 7.</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">Same with 8.1.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">zenix_2k2: Arahael deniska : I think the https://pysolfc.sourceforge.io/ packages work fine on older windows and they are built on win10</saying>
<saying who="zenix_2k2">does this mean i should ask my users to install the appropriate libraries every time they use my program ?</saying>
<saying who="Arahael">rindolf: If you know what you're doing, sure.</saying>
<saying who="Arahael">rindolf: But if you&#39;re struggling, well, one *very obvious* way to figure it out is to just use the oldest system.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">zenix_2k2: you can bundle them</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">zenix_2k2: The thing is, I think that missing lib you mentioned isn&#39;t distributed with Windows before 10. Maybe before 8.0.</saying>
<saying who="deniska">depending on the licensing terms of this library, you may redistribute it with your program</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Arahael: yes</saying>
<saying who="zenix_2k2">rindolf : bundle ? this sounds new to me</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">deniska: It looks like an MS-supplied library. MS is basically You may distribute Release versions of the dll&#39;s freely. No modification, no source, no static libs, and no debug versions.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">zenix_2k2: it is an English word</saying>
<saying who="zenix_2k2">yea but its definition in this situation isn&#39;t</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">zenix_2k2: means &quot;to include&quot;</saying>
<saying who="zenix_2k2">yes i know, but when you talk about include, i can only imagine something like &quot;#include&quot;</saying>
<saying who="zenix_2k2">in C, C++ programs</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">zenix_2k2: Think more like zip myzip myapp foo.dll</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">That&#39;s a terrible command.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">zenix_2k2: include has a more general meaning</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">zenix_2k2: Anyway, think about &#39;including&#39; something in the same archive file, or such, when people speak of bundling.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">zenix_2k2: like &quot;europeans, including Frenchmen, are ...&quot;</saying>
<me_is who="vdamewood">bundles France with Europe.</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">vdamewood: heh</saying>
<me_is who="Arahael">thinks #include &lt;frenchmen&gt; is a bit weird.</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">vdamewood: will it cost extra?</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">#include &lt;frenchman.h&gt;</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">#include &lt;aussie.h&gt;</saying>
<saying who="Arahael">#include &lt;australia.cpp&gt;</saying>
<saying who="zenix_2k2">yea, that is a good example, so bundle in this case is like a zip file ?</saying>
<saying who="deniska">#ifdef __deal__ #include &lt;uk&gt;</saying>
<saying who="deniska">&gt;_&gt;</saying>
<saying who="deniska">&lt;_&lt;</saying>
<saying who="Arahael">deniska: Isn&#39;t that over yet?</saying>
<saying who="deniska">dunno, I don&#39;t really follow this</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">zenix_2k2: Yeah, same concept. You just include it with your installer program, though, which often is something similar to a self-extracting zip file.</saying>
<saying who="zenix_2k2">Hm, i don&#39;t think pyinstaller offers any option like that</saying>

<saying who="mobinoob">mercurial is on the way out folks: https://bitbucket.org/blog/sunsetting-mercurial-support-in-bitbucket</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">time to buckle up and git gud</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mobinoob: saw that</saying>
<saying who="merijn">mobinoob: pfft, that won&#39;t stop me from using Mercurial :)</saying>
<saying who="merijn">mobinoob: I&#39;ve been using GitHub as main host for my code in mercurial for years to prepare for this moment :p</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">the mercurial rats swim to the last big sinking ship :)</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">merijn, haha but at some point you&#39;ll have to learn git though :)</saying>
<saying who="duncan">Does github support mercurial or do you just push it there as a git repo?</saying>
<saying who="merijn">mobinoob: Why? I&#39;ve managed with Mercurial since 2009 across 3 different companies where everyone was using git</saying>
<saying who="merijn">duncan: hg-git extension allows bidirectional conversion/interaction with git</saying>
<saying who="duncan">I have in my mind a long-standing idea to write a host for rcs projects that merely offers an rsync interface</saying>
<saying who="merijn">duncan: So I just clone with &quot;hg clone git+ssh://url&quot; work with Mercurial and when I&#39;m done I just do &quot;hg push&quot; and it Just Works (TM) (unless there&#39;s git submodules, then things get super annoying)</saying>
<saying who="merijn">But then submodules are also annoying in git :p</saying>
<saying who="duncan">I do understand they compare closely which is nice</saying>
<saying who="merijn">duncan: The data model is very similar, the approach to UI/workflow is not, Mercurial is much more human friendly :p</saying>
<saying who="duncan">For keeping track of notes I like to use rcs as it is so simple and reliable</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">merijn, can you also do interactive rebases etc?</saying>
<saying who="merijn">mobinoob: Why wouldn&#39;t you?</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">merijn, idk maybe there&#39;s some subset of functionality that isn&#39;t available via merc</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">you wouldn&#39;t know because you don&#39;t know git after all</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">duncan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System - this?</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">you&#39;re missing out</saying>
<saying who="duncan">Yup, good old rcs</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">duncan: i use git or hg for notes</saying>
<saying who="duncan">I have many such notes and the emacs rcs interface is good</saying>
<saying who="merijn">mobinoob: Some people say Mercurial doesn&#39;t &quot;natively&quot; support rebases, etc. because rebase is technically an extension, but it&#39;s an extension that&#39;s maintained by the Mercurial core team and ships as part of the standard mercurial install, so I think that&#39;s kinda nonsense</saying>
<saying who="merijn">mobinoob: I would actually argue that the evolve extension of Mercurial is infinitely better than interactive rebases</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">merijn, yeah an extension by the core team is good enough</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">alright guess there&#39;s no problem then</saying>
<saying who="merijn">mobinoob: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/doc/evolution/</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">it&#39;s like a javascript developer that only programs in some language that compiles to javascript</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">but less severe as it&#39;s more personal</saying>
<saying who="Jck_true">Sadly it seems like Bitbucket is dropping support for mercurial... So getting hosting for open source project is gonna get even harder under hg</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">Jck_true: That rather sucks. hg is one of the two SCMs that don&#39;t suck.</saying>
<saying who="duncan">What is the other one?</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">duncan: git</saying>
<saying who="velco">as they say in the announcement, git just won.</saying>
<saying who="velco">they&#39;ve got like 1% of users using hg</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">Though, hg&#39;s development does seem to be lagging behind the Python 2 EOL party.</saying>
<saying who="velco">and that&#39;s not the top of the foodchain 1% :P</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">popular doesn&#39;t always mean better though</saying>
<saying who="duncan">vdamewood: it is full of stuff like `git-clip-submodule --sense-change [ --cripple-branch | --overcome-archive | --hurtle-nag-subtree ]` though</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">duncan: So?</saying>
<saying who="duncan">It is a tad confusing</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">tad</saying>
<saying who="mrig">oh Hg is mercury, right got to the same page in the end :)</saying>
<saying who="mrig">I was just admiring how easy it is to use a bare remote git repo on any server; Love git.</saying>
<saying who="mrig">That said I have never tried mercurial, likely a little slow compared to git no?</saying>
<saying who="Jck_true">Speed was never an issue for me on my personal projects</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">duncan: Is that enough for it to suck?</saying>
<saying who="mrig">not that it would make the slightest difference on any of my tiny projects.</saying>
<saying who="icholy">all projects start small</saying>
<saying who="Jck_true">And wait what... As I read the blog post are they simply gonna scrap all hg repositories?!?</saying>
<saying who="duncan">I thought hg is faster than git</saying>
<saying who="icholy">noo</saying>
<saying who="icholy">Jck_true: where you reading that?</saying>
<saying who="Jck_true">&quot;Mercurial features and repositories will be officially removed from Bitbucket and its API on June 1, 2020.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">and I never found git to be super fast</saying>
<saying who="icholy">mobinoob: have you ever worked with svn?</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">icholy, once</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">icholy, svn is another level of shit though</saying>
<saying who="icholy">used to be the best</saying>
<saying who="icholy">&quot;best&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Jck_true">SVN does however have the fantastic TortoiseSVN interface... Which makes it great for non command-line users...</saying>
<saying who="Jck_true">And there is something nice about the &quot;everything is on the server&quot;</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">lmao you&#39;re joking right?</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">I wonder what major open-source projects still use Hg.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mobinoob: what is faster than git? perforce?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vdamewood: firefox</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">rindolf: I thought they might. I wonder if Thunderbird does, too.</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">rindolf, idk</saying>
<saying who="Jck_true">mobinoob: You&#39;re welcome to call me stupid. But like 40% of the time I don&#39;t know what the fuck I am doing when it comes to git stuff...</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vdamewood: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">Jck_true, we all make mistakes, it&#39;s never too late to git gud</saying>
<saying who="icholy">rapidwave: most are hand-written</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jck_true: i still miss the simplicity and transparency of the svn model</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jck_true: though I&#39;m mostly using git and hg now</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">once you get git at the basic level it becomes easy in usage</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jck_true: but i don't feel i understand their program model</saying>
<saying who="icholy">took me a long time before I really &quot;got&quot; git</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">the process takes years and requires an inquisitive mind</saying>
<saying who="icholy">this talk is pretty good https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCnnSryzPrE</saying>
<saying who="Jck_true">That is such backwards thinking... ~60 years of computer science? And Git is the best we can do?</saying>
<saying who="icholy">Jck_true: I feel ya</saying>
<saying who="Jck_true">(But only if you spend a few years learning it)</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">Jck_true, Linus would be sad to see those words</saying>
<saying who="icholy">it&#39;s really great once you master it though</saying>
<saying who="icholy">kinda like vim</saying>
<saying who="icholy">the UX is the main issue with git</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">damn git was created in 2005, doesn&#39;t seem that old</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">as in 2005 wasn&#39;t that long ago</saying>
<saying who="Jck_true">That is how I tried explaining it to my ex wife. Told her she just needed a few more years getting to know me and then everything would be great between us</saying>
<saying who="icholy">lmao</saying>
<saying who="mobinoob">on the first date: &quot;just let me fuck you for a couple of years, eventually it&#39;ll git gud&quot;</saying>
<saying who="noteqstmo">not that long ago? hmm git is half as old as x86 arch?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jck_true: heh</saying>
<saying who="noteqstmo">386 i mean</saying>
<saying who="noteqstmo">wait was 286 32 bit?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">noteqstmo: it wasn&#39;t</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">&quot;The Intel 80286[3] (also marketed as the iAPX 286[4] and often called Intel 286) is a 16-bit microprocessor&quot; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">noteqstmo: the first x86 was 8086/8088</saying>
<saying who="noteqstmo">yeah definitely meant 386 with that comment then</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">noteqstmo: and it was compatible with the 8080</saying>
<saying who="GeDaMo">Only in the sense that 8080 assembly could be run through a translator to get 8086 assembly</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">there was also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog</saying>

<saying who="WebStorm">it seems in my country node jobs pay about $20k more a year than rails jobs</saying>
<saying who="WebStorm">I guess if I want $20k extra I should stick to node</saying>
<saying who="WebStorm">I did some research</saying>
<saying who="pulse">people who see programming just as a way of making money weird me out</saying>
<saying who="deniska">pulse: I started programming because it seemed like a fun thing to do, and as a bonus I can also have jobs involving it</saying>
<saying who="pulse">deniska, that&#39;s a proper mindset</saying>
<saying who="deniska">but caring about programming only from 9 to 5 is a valid mindset too</saying>
<saying who="pulse">deniska, disagreed</saying>
<saying who="pulse">if you treat programming as a way to get money then your code will necessarily suck</saying>
<saying who="pulse">you should treat code with all the respect it deserves, and consider money as a happy side product</saying>
<saying who="pulse">it&#39;s the same in any other craft, to be honest</saying>
<saying who="pulse">prioritizing money means you don&#39;t give the craft the attention it requires</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pulse: and it likely will result in less money</saying>
<saying who="pulse">rindolf, yes, ironically enough</saying>
