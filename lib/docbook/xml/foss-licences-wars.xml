    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
        When <ulink url="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky 
            ("Joel on Software")</ulink> wrote his notorious blog post
        <ulink url="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01.html">"Language
            Wars"</ulink>, many people asked whether he has "jumped the
        shark" and that his blog will go downhill from there. I too have read
        the post, and agreed, that while it had a few good points, it was
        too based on "feeling rather than knowing". Joel later on posted
        many good articles and shorter entries on his blog, but many people
        still recalled it as a very low-point in the blog.
    </para>

    <para>
        Like Joel, I have a home-site and several blogs, where I post articles
        and essays about my thoughts, and this time I've decided to risk
        something similar to what Joel has done on an equally flamatory topic:
        <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_licence">licences
            of open-source software</ulink>. I'm going to introduce the various
        options, explain a little about their motivation and then
        give some advice according to my own personal opinion.
    </para>

    <para>
        I should note that I am not a lawyer, and only write this according
        to my best knowledge, understanding and experience.
        <footnote id="ianal" title="IANAL">
            <para>
                Some people believe that discussing legal matters should be
                reserved to people who are Law experts. However, this is
                a <ulink url="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=39148&amp;cid=62149">sub-case 
                    of the "only specialists should deal with a
                specialised field" fallacy</ulink>.
            </para>
            <para>
                Like it or not, the Law affects us all and the Government
                expects common citizens to be aware of it and not violate
                it, even if they are not lawyers. As software developers, we
                do not limit discussions on software and computing to people
                with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (much less a
                Ph.D. or whatever) and often not-too-qualified people can be
                very knowledgeable and/or productive.
            </para>
            <para>
                Similarly, I expect discussions on the governmental law to
                have a lower barrier for entry than people who are qualified 
                lawyers, or Law Professors.
            </para>
        </footnote>
        I think what I'm writing here is correct, but would still appreciate
        any correction for future versions. If you're unsure about my advice,
        then you should consult a legal expert (if you
        can afford one) or your local or global Free and Open Source Software
        organisation. I cannot guarantee my advice is valid.
    </para>
    <section id="spoiler">
        <title>Spoiler</title>

        <para>
            In this spoiler I'll explain what I'm using right away, which is
            also what I recommend other people to use. When I started
            releasing my code as open-source software, I used <ulink 
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">the 
                Public Domain</ulink>. So, for example,
            <ulink url="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</ulink>
            which is one of my earliest projects and still one
            of the most successful, used to carry <ulink url="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/fc-solve/trunk/fc-solve/source/COPYING?rev=705&amp;view=log">a 
                <filename>COPYING</filename> file</ulink> with the 
                following contents:
        </para>
        <blockquote>
            <para>
                Relax, this is not GPL software, but rather it is distributed
                under the public domain. It means it can be linked against
                anything, converted to any different license, freely used and
                distributed, and anything else without any restrictions 
                whatsoever. No Strings Attached!â„¢
            </para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>
            (This was also a joke of sorts.)
        </para>

        <para>
            Later on, to avoid the problematic status of public domain code
            in many countries, and to avoid other potential legal problems,
            I started distributing my original code under <ulink 
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_license">the 
                MIT X11 Licence</ulink>, a BSD-style licence which is the 
            closest one to the Public Domain. If the project I'm
            contributing to has a different licence, then I disclaim any
            explicit or implicit ownership on the code I wrote, and allow
            the existing copyright holders to do with my code as they see
            fit.
        </para>

        <para>
            Note that I'm using different terms for other types of
            digital artworks. Most of my essays (including this one) are
            under the <ulink url="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative 
                Commons Attribution Licence</ulink>, my original (i.e: 
            non-derived-work or fan-art) fictitious stories are under 
            <ulink url="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">the 
                Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike Licence</ulink>
            (which is more GPL-like), and most of the
            photos I took and published were placed under the Public Domain.

            <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free 
                Software Definition</ulink> free software must fulfil 4

                <para>

                    The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to
                    your needs. Access to the source code is a precondition 
                    for this.

                    The freedom to improve the program, and release your

                    benefits . Access to the source code is a precondition
                    for this. 
                </para>

        </listitem></orderedlist>

        <para>

            The <ulink
                url="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.php">Open
                Source definition</ulink> is similar, but some licences can
            qualify as open-source and not as free software. This is usually
            not an issue, because the majority of open source software out
            there is free as well. (And few people would like to create an
            open-source licence that's not endorsed by the Free Software
            foundation.)

        </para>

        <para>
            A software licence qualifies as a free software/open-source 
            licence, if it allows those four freedoms. There's still a lot of 
            room to manoeuvre and to impose various restrictions, but otherwise
            these freedoms make them usable enough for the users and
            co-developers. 
        </para>
    </section>

    <section id="public-domain-licences">

        <title>Public Domain Licences</title>

        <para>
            The first type of licences are public-domain-like licences, also
            known as 
            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD-style 
                licences</ulink>, <ulink 
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_free_software_licence">Permissive 
                free software licences</ulink>, or
            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycenter">"Copycenter 
                licences"</ulink>. These licences allow you to do almost
            anything conceivable with the program and its source code, 
            including distributing then, selling them, using the resultant
            software for any purpose, incorporating into other software,
            or even converting copies to different licences, including
            that of <ulink 
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">non-free (so-called "proprietary") software</ulink>.
        </para>

        <para>
            Probably the only two actions none of these licences
            allow is removing the original copyright notice, or suing the 
            creator of the software for damages (the latter is due to the 
            "no warranty" clause). Some of them pose some additional that
            do not reduce from their public domain nature.
        </para>

        <para>
            Prominent examples of Public Domain licences include:
        </para>

                        various BSD licences</ulink>, under which
                    the "Berkeley Software Development" UNIX variant
                    were made available. The original 4-clause 
                    BSD licence contained an additional <ulink

                    that required publishing the names of the copyright
                    holders on every advertising material. This proved
                    to be a problem and was rendered GPL-incompatible
                    and so using this licence is no longer recommended.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Later on, the advertising clause was removed to formulate
                    3-clause and 2-clause BSD licences, which are both less
                    problematic and GPL-compatible.

                    many activities with the licensed code, including 
                    sub-licensing, which means converting derived works

                    version - Apache 2.0 was partially created in order
                    to be compatible with version 2 of the GPL, but the
                    FSF ruled the Apache Licence as incompatible with it.
                    The Apache Licence, however, was declared as compatible

        The Artistic Licence was later clarified into the Clarified Artistic

    Moreover, the Apache 2.0 Licence was specifically phrased to be

    licence, it was not compatible with the GPLv2 (although it is with the 
    GPLv3 that was published afterwards). Their legal teams still disagree
    on that matter.

    I should note that I have issues with the entire Debian policy of 
including only free-as-in-speech material in their distribution, regardless 
of its type. I don't feel that non-software-content (e.g: documents in human
languages, graphics, audio, video, animations, non-code binary data, etc.) 
should be treated by the same rules as software, and even

    Another curious licence is the <ulink 
        url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License">Affero GPL</ulink> - 
- which aims to close the "Application Service Provider Loophole". What it 
means is that if I install an AGPLed program on a public web-server and modify 
it then I must make my modifications public. However, <link 
    linkend="what-is-a-free-software-licence">the Free Software 
Definition</link> , says that one must have "The 
freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to his needs.". As a 
result, I personally don't consider the AGPL as free (because I may wish to 
run it on my publicly accessible web-server and modify it), but the FSF 
thinks otherwise. We have enough problems with the suitability of the GPL for 
embedded systems, that we don't need to kill the prospering web-apps market too.

        Now that we covered the controversy of whether some licences are

            Well, I'm not sure it is a bad idea, but choosing a licence for a
            non-FOSS program is out of the scope for this document.
            I'm not going to stop you from trying, but neither can I help
            you with the licence choice. My best advice is to consult 
            a lawyer.

        <para> 
            Now, since version 2 of the GPL is incompatible with version
            3, and vice-versa (due to the additional restrictions imposed 
            by version 3) you shouldn't choose GPLv2-only or GPLv3-only or
            GPLv3-and-above, because some projects may be licensed only under
            one of them. Also, the version 3 of the LGPL is incompatible with 
            the GPLv2, so you shouldn't choose it either.  
            GPL-version-2-or-above or LGPL-version-2.1-or-above should be 
            OK in this respect.

        <para>
            Using your own custom licence deprives you of the benefit of using

            Essentially, the licence of perl (the Perl implementation) has

            Artistic license is not considered free and GPL compatible by the
            Free Software Foundation, so it's not a wise choice, and the
            GPL has its share of problems too (see below) so it's not a wise

        <para>
            The GNU General Public Licence (GPL) and GNU Lesser General
            Public Licence (LGPL) contain many additional restrictions to the 
            concept of copyleft, and are very mis-understood, over-hyped, and 
            don't maintain compatibility with newer versions. Even

            reportedly problematic</ulink>
        </para>


        <para> 
            The GPL and LGPL are of more political nature than other similar
            FOSS licences, and as such should be avoided. I recommend using the
            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepycat_License">Sleepycat 
                licence</ulink>, which is a strong-copyleft licence, that is
            compatible with GPLv2 and above, instead of the GPL and the 
            Artistic 2.0 (or above) licence instead of the LGPL. And naturally
            permissive, non-copyleft, open-source licences such as the MIT 
            X11 Licence are an option. What the SleepyCat licence says
            is that code distributed under it, must remain under it, and
            that one must release the source code for publically-distributed 
            binaries that link against it. However, from my understand, as
            opposed to the GPL, this source code doesn't have to be completely
            free. It doesn't have the additional
            restrictions on licences compatibility that the GPL has, nor does
            it have the other obscure and not-well-understood restrictions
            that the GPL has.
        </para>

        <para> 
            I read the GPLv2 originally once and couldn't understand it. The
            LGPLv2 or the GPLv3 would likely prove to be more problematic.
            I find it harder to trust lengthy documents that I am unable to
            understand. I had no problem understanding the Sleepycat licence,
            the Perl Artistic licence, or the MIT X11 and BSD licences,
            so I can better recommend them instead.

                on how people can violate one's licence. While I commonly
                hear about GPL violations, I don't ever recall hearing
                about a violation of a permissive, BSD-style licence.

    <title>Strong Copyleft and Preventing Threats to FOSS</title>

    <para>

        When I <ulink
            url="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/5009">posted
            an early draft of this essay</ulink> to <ulink
            url="http://www.hackers.org.il/">Hackers-IL mailing list</ulink>, I
        received <ulink
            url="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/5017">a
            comment</ulink> about the fact that GPL (or other strong copyleft
        licences) prevent threats to free and open source software. I'd like to
        reply to it here.

    </para>

    <para>
        Quoting from the comment:
    </para>

    <blockquote>
        <para>

            In the second half of the 90s, <ulink 
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X-Windows</ulink> 
            was quite popular - a
            department (in universities, companies, etc.) would have strong
            Unix workstations (from Sun, DEC, SGI, HP and other vendors) and
            people would have cheaper machines showing the output from the
            strong machine using X-Windows. As MS-Windows grew popular, people
            wanted to use their PC running Windows to display X-Windows
            sessions. But unfortunately, the only X server available for
            Windows was commercial software (Exceed), which could happen
            because X was BSD-licensed and not GPL. Users (at the time, most
            had corporate or university funds - they weren't home users) bit
            the bullet and paid. It took literarly years before a free X server
            for Windows became available.

        </para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>
        My response is that this was indeed a problem and inconvenieced the
        users of Exceed. However, if X-Windows were GPLed, then the 
        people who made Exceed and wanted to sell it, would not have made it 
        in the first place, because they had to make it GPLed and keep
        it as FOSS. So either they would have implemented it from scratch or 
        not at all. It is possible that a different group would have created a 
        free X server for Windows, but it is possible that no free X server 
        would have been available at all. And if a different group
        could have created a free X server for Windows without Exceed, they 
        could have certainly created it with it.
    </para>

    <para>
        Furthermore, If X11 had been initiated under a non-BSD-style-licence, 
        then it is possible it would not have become as ubiquitous as it is in 
        the UNIX world, thus making it irrelevant to port it to Windows in the
        first place. We can't tell that for sure, but I think it is a
        possibility.
    </para>

    <para>
        Quoting again:
    </para>

    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <para>
            For example, someone integrated my <ulink url="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver library</ulink> in a 
            <ulink url="http://www.ambermango.com/php/am/f3d/index.php">shareware
                
                (without source) game he wrote titled Freecell 3D</ulink>
        </para>

        <para>
            He sells ths game online. It did not do any damage, because
            there are plenty of Freecell implementations around. I on my part
            am pretty happy with the open-source PySolFC.
        </para>

        </blockquote>

<para>
Let's imagine that you wrote a great freecell solver library, but you suck at
UI and failed to create a graphical game based on that library, and wish that
someone created a UI on top of your library. If your library is BSD, someone
could create this UI but make it commercial and not even you can use it.
If your library is GPL, this person is forced to either make his code public
(so you and your friends can use it) or pay you for a new license.
Which of those scenarios will make you happier? I can't see how the GPL isn't
better in this scenario.
</para>

</blockquote>

<para>
    Well, first of all I should note that that is a lot of "if"'s. When I 
    started working on Freecell Solver, there were already plenty of graphical 
    Freecell games, possibly with support for other variants of Solitaire. And
    there were also several open-source ones, including some very polished
    ones.
</para>

<para>
    As a result, I could have easily integrated my solver into one of them. So
    your thought experiment is not very realistic, although it may be valid in
    the general case.
</para>

<para>
    Back to the thought experiment, a person who would be interested in 
    creating a commercial Freecell UI and still integrate a solving mechanism
    to it could:
</para>

<orderedlist>

    <listitem>
        <para>
            Develop his own Freecell solving library from scratch. That will
            probably be less work than developing the rest of the
            graphical Freecell game.
        </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
        <para>
            Write a command line executable that uses the library call it, and
            process its output. This strategy was taken by the developers of
            the open-source
            <ulink 
                url="http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/">PySolFC</ulink> out of 
            convenience using my existing "fc-solve" executable.
        </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
        <para>
            Write a GPLed server for solving Freecell that the graphical
            game would communicate with using TCP/IP or a different IPC
            mechanism.
        </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
        <para>
            Decide that developing a graphical game only to later release it
            as free software won't be worth his time, and as a result not
            develop it at all.
        </para>
    </listitem>

</orderedlist>

<para>
    In all of these cases, we won't have a graphical game as FOSS.
</para>

<para>
    Finally I'd rather have a proprietary derived work than no derived
    program at all, or that instead someone will duplicate my effort in 
    creating a BSD-style or a proprietary replacement for my work.
