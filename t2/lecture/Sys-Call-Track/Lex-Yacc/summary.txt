Lex & Yacc Mini-Lecture and Demo Summary:
-----------------------------------------

1. Generators:
--------------

Lex and Yacc are _generators_, i.e: program that generate
code of other programs. Each one has a different, important
function in constructing compilers or interpreters, and can
many times save a lot of programming hassle.

2. Lex:
-------

* Unless we program in vi macros, we are usually interested, not
in a character-by-character analysis of a stream of data, but
rather in a token-by-token one. A token is a logical unit of the
data stream. For example, the C expression:

a = hello(5+6, "you");

contains the following tokens:
"a", "=", "hello", "(", "5", "+", "6", ",", "\"you\"", ")", ";"

* A lexical analyzer (a.k.a: lexer or tokeniser) transform the data
stream into a stream of tokens.

3. How to use Lex:
------------------

* Lex works by identifying a regular expressions with each type of token,
and then returning both the type and the text.

* Lex will first attempt to find matches that match the most text, and then
such that have earlier definitions. (the Perl version ignores the length of
the matches and arbitrates based on definition place alone)

* Show example of the lexer:

4. Yacc:
--------

* Yacc is a parser (a.k.a syntax analyzer) generator. A parser takes a
stream of tokens, and performs operations on it based on the precedence
of the operators, their layout, and other grammatical rules.

* Yacc automatically generates a parser based on a grammar specification
that is very similar to the formal languages known from Computer Science.

5. Formal Languages:
--------------------

* A formal language is a set of rules, each one may have several alternatives.

* In each alternative a transformation from an upper construct to a sequence
of other constructs is specified.

* The parser tries to analyze whether the stream of tokens can be expanded to
match the top-most construct.

* Example: (constructs are in uppercase, atoms are in lowercase)

The grammar S -> aSb | [empty string] matches all the strings of
"", "ab", "aabb", "aaabbb", "aaaabbbb" etc.

The grammar S -> S+S | S*S | N ; N -> [number]
matches all mathematical expressions that contain only addition and
multiplication.

The grammar S -> S+S | S*S | (S) | N ; N -> [number]
does the same only this time parenthesis are added.

6. Precedence and Direction:
-----------------------------

The precedence and direction of processing of the operators can be
specified in the beginning of the file.

7. Yacc Example:
----------------

* Yacc accepts as input a formal language specification and some precedence
and direction rules and generates an efficient LALR parser for the grammar.
