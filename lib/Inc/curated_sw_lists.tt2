Quite a few people, including me, have been lamenting the
<a href="https://github.com/shlomif/shlomi-fish-homepage/blob/master/lib/notes/quality-software--followup-2018.md">poor

to combat this, I decided to collect links to tools and other resources that can help
enhancing the quality of software.
