[Selina Mandrake is sitting in a classroom taking notes, the other students
are paying attention, and taking notes too. Selina is an attractive (but
not overly so) girl in her high school senior year, who has immigrated
to California from England.]

Selina’s Internal Dialogue: [In her native English accent] Wow! Why did I have
to major in history. All we learn about is minutae of obscure political
documents from modern times. Like that’s going to prepare me for being an
Archaeologist . Maybe I should have majored in maths… or physics… or something.

+++: Not to mention that U.S. Archaeology is a joke. Not that England is much
better. Maybe I could study somewhere in the middle east. Turkey… Egypt…
Israel… mmm…

<s id="in-the-hallway" title="In the hallway">

[The bell rings and many school kids are walking out of the classroom,
including Selina. She has an empty hour. As she walks in the hallway, she
is sometimes greeted by “Hi, Selina!”, “What’s new?”, etc. and answers
briefly. She finds Jessica and Jonathan standing next to Jessica’s locker and
approaches them.]

Selina: Oh, there you are. Hi Jess, hi Jon.

Jessica: Selina! I see you’ve survived History class.

Selina: Yeah, I’ll take it one lesson at a time, I guess.

[Jonathan hugs Selina from the side and eventually leaves.]

Selina: So how are you two love-birds?

Jessica: Oh, this and that, discussing computers endlessly as usual.

Selina: [Sarcastically] Geeks!

Jessica: Heh, like you’re not a geek too.

Selina: I is!

Jessica: And we is too.

Selina: True.

Selina: This reminds me. I really should update my Mandriva system at home.
I have not in several days, now. And to think I originally had my friend
Aaron install Mandrake Linux for me, because I thought it was cool that
it was called the same as my last name.

Jessica: Heh, maybe you should become Selina Mandriva now.

Jonathan: Or Selina Mageia.

[Selina bursts out laughing.]

Selina: That sounds like a name of a vampire slayer… or a vampire.

Jonathan: Or both.

Selina: Yeah. I told you about how I was nicknamed “Puffy” and then “Buffy”
during one summer camp, right?

Jessica: Yes, many times.

Selina: Yeah, I found it amusing at the time. For a while afterwards, I
insisted that my friends call me “Buffy” until I realised it was silly, and
reverted back to “Selina”.

Jessica: Anyway, I’m off to gym.

Selina: Bye, love you.

[Selina is reading a book and says to herself out loud]

Selina: Selina “Buffy” Mandrake. <b>The</b> Slayer. I like the sound of it.

<s id="at-home-1" title="Selina at Home">

[Selina enters her house, she goes to her room and drops her backpack.
Afterwards, she goes to the kitchen, opens the refrigerator’s door, and pours
a glass of juice. She drinks some of it.]

Selina: What a day!

[After a few more arrangements, she goes to a desktop computer, turns on the
screen, moves the mouse. It’s a screen of Linux with Pidgin running. Selina
scrolls the Pidgin contact list a little, finds someone called
“Mosheh Ben-Amram” and double clicks his icon. A window pops up.]

Selina: [On pidgin] Hi Mosheh!

Mosheh: Good day, Selina.

Selina: Yes, it was pretty good. How was your day?

Mosheh: It was fine. Business is as usual.

Selina: That’s good.

Mosheh: Yours?

Selina: Well, the highlight is that my friend and mine decided that I should
probably change my name to Selina Mandriva or even Selina Mageia, and become
a mighty vampire slayer.

Mosheh: Hmmm… interesting.

Selina: Yes, “Selina ‘Buffy’ Mageia, *The* Slayer”. Don’t you like the sound
of it?

Mosheh: Heh, maybe.

Selina: BTW, when are you going to finally come here to California?

Mosheh: In time. I like it here, in the meanwhile.

Selina: OK. Listen, I need to go and eat supper, so we’ll talk later.

Mosheh: Bye!

[Selina turns off the computer screen.]

Selina’s internal dialogue: OK, let’s see what there is to eat.

<s id="meet-the-guide" title="Meet the Guide">

[Selina is back at school, and is walking on a corridor, smiling. She opens a
door and the corridor is empty except for “The Guide”, an attractive Goth-style
man who looks in his mid-twenties and is standing there watching her with a
grave facial expression.]

[Selina looks at him, smiles and walks towards him. As she passes him he says
in a dramatic voice:]

The Guide: MAGEIA!

[Selina turns around hesitantly.]

Selina: What?!

The Guide: BUFFY MAGEIA! THAT IS YOUR DESTINY. AND I SHALL BE YOUR GUIDE.

Selina: I don’t know how you heard of what happened the other day, but it’s
just a joke. My name is Selina Mandrake.

The Guide: YOU KNOW YOU’RE REALLY BUFFY MAGEIA. AND BEING <b>THE</b> SLAYER
IS YOUR DESTINY.

Selina: OK, I think you take Buffy way too seriously. I am not really a Vampire
Slayer, and vampires and the other demons that you could see there don’t really
exist.

The Guide: [Giggles] THE PORTRAYAL OF BUFFY, THE VAMPIRE SLAYER IN THE
TELEVISION SHOW WAS VERY EXAGGERATED. THE REAL BUFFY IN QUESTION IS AN
INCOMPETENT SLAYER. EVEN I AM BETTER THAN HER.

+++: YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, POSSESS FAR GREATER POWERS AND ARE
<b>THE SLAYER</b>. [his eyes are lightened with fire.]

[Selina is startled. ]

Selina: OK, how did you do that fire in your eyes thing.

The Guide: MAGIC. MAGIC PERMEATES THE UNIVERSE.

Selina: This must be some kind of trick. [She starts walking in the corridor
. The Guide is following her.]

Selina: Please don’t follow me. [She opens a door to another corridor]

[In the corridor there’s a scared and screaming high school girl to the left,
and a blood thirsty vampire with his fangs out to the right. The blood thirsty vampire approaches the girl.]

Selina: [She screams] Oh my God!

[The Guide quickly moves her away, and quickly throws a small wooden stake
at the vampire’s heart. The vampire shrieks and evaporates into dust. The
girl looks at him and faints.]

[Selina is startled and looks around while holding her fingers to her mouth.
The Guide moves towards the fainted girl, he makes a gesture around her eyes
with his hand, grabs her hand and guides her through getting off the floor.
The Girl wakes up.]

Karen: [Looks at Selina] Oh hi! I remember you from History class…

Selina: [Uncomfortably] Yes, I’m there.

Karen: We’re also in the same French class, I think.

Selina: [Swallowing her speech] Oui…

Karen: Well, I’d better be going. [She looks at your guide] Wow! Your Goth
friend is really cute. Bye, see you.

Selina: Bye!

[Karen leaves.]

Selina: Oh my God, oh my God. Magic.

+++: OK, this cannot be happening. I must be dreaming that. [She pinches
various parts of her body. The Guide hits her strongly on her arm.]

Selina: Ouch! OK, I’m not sleeping. Maybe I’m crazy. This seems like
Schizophrenia. Maybe I’ve been unhappy lately, and too much stress or maybe
it’s genetic…

The Guide: YOU ARE NOT CRAZY, MAGEIA!

Selina: OK, OK. Tell you what? I’ll play along… but even if I am <b>The</b>
Slayer, I won’t be a good one. I’m not into martial arts, and I’m really clumsy.
As much as I like playing Basketball (and I do), I royally suck at it…

The Guide: BUFFY, YOU WON’T NEED MY MEDIOCRE SLAYING SKILLS. YOU POSSESS FAR
GREATER POWERS. THE DEMONS WHO ARE YOUR ENEMIES SHALL BE SLAIN BY YOU ONE BY
ONE, CULMINATING IN NONE OTHER THAN <b>THE MASTER</b>, THE VAMPIRE WITH THE
OLDEST SOUL.

Selina: Wasn’t he slain at the end of the first season.

[The Guide looks at her unamused.]

Selina: OK, got it - it wasn’t real.

+++: OK now. I’ll guess I’ll just try to be mentally prepared for slaying
such demons as the one we just saw and that you slew.

The Guide: NO. FAR MORE POWERFUL DEMONS THAN THAT INCOMPETENT ONE.

Selina: OK, that’s really comforting.

+++: Well, I guess I’ll go and make the most out of the rest of this recess.
Maybe I’ll go take a walk or just surf the Internet aimlessly.

The Guide: SOUNDS LIKE AN EXCELLENT WAY TO GET PREPARED FOR YOUR DESTINY, MAGEIA.

Selina: Well, slayer or not - I’m still just Selina Mandrake. Well, see you Mr.
Guide.

The Guide: MAY THE LIGHT SIDE OF THE MAGICAL FORCES OF NATURE GUIDE YOU.

[Selina and a boy she’s on a date with (Matthew) are sitting on a bench
in a park, and are finishing eating a pizza tray. Selina looks around
thoughtfully. ]

Matthew: Selina, do you want the last slice?

[Pause for a moment]

Selina: What? [She turns to face Matthew.]

Matthew: The last slice, would you like to eat it?

Selina: Ah, no, that’s OK - I’m full.

Matthew: OK, I’ll eat it later.

+++: You seem distracted.

Selina: Yeah, I have a lot on my mind.

Matthew: Anything you’d like to share?

Selina: Nah, it’s not something I can actually share. [She looks around and
turns back to face Matthew] I probably was an awful date tonight - so
self-centred, so non-talkative. You probably think I’m always like that.
And Matthew, frankly, you were really great tonight.

Matthew: I don’t think you have been a bad date, Selina. [Selina smiles. Matthew
moves the pizza box to his other side, and gets closer to Selina.]

Selina: OK, let’s improve this date even more.

[She closes her eyes and Matthew reaches to kiss her. Selina kisses him back.

Alan: [From the distance] Hey, where can we find Miss Selina Mandrake here?

Librarian: [From the distance] She’s right there.

Alan: Thank you, madame.

[Alan and John approach. They are two young British men, dressed in
cheap, commercial clothing.]

Alan: Hello, Miss Mandrake. I’m Alan. [she shakes his hand.]

John: John. [shakes his hand.]

Alan: We’re mighty vampires.

Selina: [Amusingly] Selina Mandrake, mighty pirate.

John: Wow! You’ve played the Monkey Islands too? That’s so cool.

Selina: Yes, I have. How may I be of service?

Alan: Well, according to the Codex, we’re supposed to be slain by you.

Selina: Well, Codex or not, I have no intention of directly slaying vampires,
because even if they are blood sucking parasites, I’m not too big into
initiatory force and all.

John: Hey, we are completely non-violent vampires. We don’t suck blood.

Selina: I thought all vampires suck blood.

John: Bullocks, hen. Vampires come in all shapes and sizes.

Selina: Lovely, so I guess I’m not going to slay you.

John: Sounds good.

Selina: Anyway, I see you come from the old mother land.

John: Yes, we are British blokes, all right. Lots of vampires are Brits.
I’m from Yorkshire and Alan here…

Alan: Yo!

John: Alan is from London.

Selina: Great. It’s too bad so many Americans are oblivious to all the great
British culture. America is too culturally inbred.

Alan: Totally! Like many of the people we talked to have not watched <b>all</b>
of the Monty Python skits.

[Selina smiles.]

John: Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!

Alan: I know: suicide squad!

[Selina is startled. Alan and John take two pencils and say, they put the
pencils to their heart and say.]

Alan: All dead! [gives John a high five.]

Selina: Wait! These pencils are made out of wood.

John and Alan: OH NO! WE HAVE BEEN SLAIN BY BUFFY MAGEIA, THE SLAYER.

[They cry and evaporate into dust.]

Selina: Oh, crap! [She touches the chairs where they sat with her finger.]

Warrior #2: we can assume any form.

Warrior #1: yes, we can fight using any weapon, and we are masters of them

Mephiqoleth: MAGEIA!

Mephiqoleth: MY NAME IS MEPHIQOLETH.

Mephiqoleth: it is written in Leshon Haqodesh.

Selina: “Leshon Haqodesh”? The holy tongue? You mean:

Mephiqoleth: YES!!!… HEBREW! [Non-dramatically] I am Jewish.

Selina: Jewish? But you're not human.

Mephiqoleth: THERE ARE JEWS OF MANY SPECIES.

Selina: Really? That's great - can I have a Jewish lady cat? I want one
so she can mother cute little Jewish kittens.

[Cut to Mephiqoleth - he is not amused.]

Selina: You are not amused, demons are never amused. I should have learned
that by now.

+++: Anyway, what is it you want from me?

Mephiqoleth: MAGEIA, YOU ARE NOW EIGHT AND TEN YEARS OLD - YOU ARE NOW A
WOMAN.

Selina: So I've suddenly become a woman at 18? I'm only one day older than
yesterday, and I had my period for many years now, and…

Mephiqoleth: YOU MUST TEST ME! I POSSESS POWERFUL MYSTICAL POWERS, AND YOU
MUST SEE IF THEY ARE POWERFUL ENOUGH FOR YOU.

Selina: They are. I believe you.

Mephiqoleth: NOT SO QUICKLY. MY GREATEST MYSTICAL POWER, WHICH FEW OTHER DEMONS
POSSESS, IS MY TELEPORTATION ABILITY. I CAN TELEPORT YOU ANYWHERE.

Selina: You can? Like where?

Mephiqoleth: ANYWHERE YOU WANT!

Selina: OK… well, I’m feeling adventurous, so I want the crème-de-la-crème,
the cat’s whiskers, the face that launched a thousand ships…

Mephiqoleth: YOU DO NOT MEAN… <b>THE AMBER!</b>.

Selina: Yes, the Amber. The Amber being…

<b>The Slayer</b> and then, the… the…

Aharon: the dispeller!

Selina: exactly. Was it destiny? [starts crying] Was it fate? Did I want to?

[ Mosheh and Ahraon drag Selina to a bench, where she sits down and wheeps. ]

Selina: and what kind of slayer cries like a baby?

Mosheh: here - have a handkerchief.

Selina: thank you. [Weeps into the handerkerchief.]

Mosheh: and don't worry, Selina, some of our most admired and toughest male
warrior vampires, had cried in less aggravating conditions than yours. We
are all human.

Selina: [cries some more] OK, I'm the Dispeller, now what do we do?

Mosheh: whatever you want.

Selina: should I dispel stuff?

Mosheh: you already did, but it was done by vampires, both human and non-human,
since the beginning of the universe.

Selina: then why do they need me?

Mosheh: well, how should I start. I gather you've watched Star Trek: Deep Space
Nine?

Selina: I did, great show. Hold it, hold it! Not their prophets and the Vadeks
and Kai Win, and…

Mosheh: yep, they are all real to an extent (minus some Hollywood deviations,
and exaggerations).

Selina: oh God… who is probably Don Knuth, right. I know the “Knuth is not God”
meme.

Mosheh: well, according to the prophets he is “The God” and “The Neo-Tech God”.

Selina: why Neo-Tech?

Mosheh: because we are part of “The Neo-Tech conspiracy for establishing the
Semitic culture”.

Selina: wasn't it established thousands of years ago?

Aharon: well, like the prophets would say “Before? After?”.

Selina: got it.

Selina: OK, so people dispelled in the past, and they needed me as some kind
of role model to look up to, in order to dispel. How lame!

+++: But what were these slaying tests, with The Guide, and these weird demons,
and… God, they made me feel so helpless, and mad, and sad, and… all for becoming
a silly Bajorean God?

+++: [she stands up] Couldn't you have given me a written examination?

Mosheh: that would not be adequate for us. See, as vampires, we constantly have
to deal with a lot of emotions and frustrations in our personal and
professional lives. Dispelling is not always easy, and you are going to
encounter many obstacles along the way from envious people, who are threatened
by what you say, or stubborn people, or sycophants, or even people who care
about what you say or have important ammendements.

+++: dispelling is not just fun and games, you know.

Selina: I see. [Selina giggles.]

Mosheh: I should also tell you about the Q continuum.

Selina: yes, I gather it existed, only it seems that the Qs cannot be
omnipotent, because it's a logical impossibility.

Mosheh: they are not. They are regular humanoids, or other aliens, who have
ascended to be vampires and Qs, and who possess extremely powerful (but not
omnipotent or “supernatural”) technology.

Selina: I see. Did they provide the special effects?

Mosheh: you guessed it.

Selina: OK, I’m still mad at you. But since I still find all this fascinating
(I have to as an Archaeologist-wannabe and stuff), I’m going to continue
talking to you, despite being mad.

Mosheh: sure. You may wish to know that the Bajoran scholars considered
dispelling as the next logical level after slaying.

Selina: and The Slayer was Buffy from the show?

Mosheh: no. The fictional Buffy Anne Summers was a mighty slayer, but she
was just The Vampire Slayer. The Slayer and the concept of slaying predates
her.

Selina: I see. So whom do I have the dubious honour to succeed?

Mosheh: this is a complicated story, but let me ask you: have you read The
Three Muskeeters?

Selina: by Dumas? Of course! … What?! Milady de-Winter?! She?!

Mosheh: the more accurate story is a bit more complicated, but maybe you’d
like to hear it from a more authoritative source.

Selina: who?

Mosheh: look behind you.

<s id="kate-tells-her-story" title="Kate tells her story">

Kate: my first. Well, I was actually born Kate Hampshire, a young Anglican
baby born to English parents on French soil. I grew up among French children,
who welcomed me as their own, but when my parents and I returned back to
England when I was 5 years old, I was ridiculed for my French, and so
wanted to hear nothing of it, until I was older and had to relearn French much
more painfully.

Selina: but you still had a trace of a French accent…

Kate: precisely.

+++: anyway, as opposed to Dumas’ description, I was a brunette, for
which some no-goodnicks from my whereabouts, ridiculed me of being of
Jewish heritage, but eventually, I knew not to care. There were plenty of
other brunette girls among my friends, anyway.

+++: so, my father wanted me to learn the proper Christian law and ethics, so
he taught me how to read English, and told me to read the Bible. I grew to love
it, and considered the various characters there as my friends.

+++: Moreover, I organised various shows by children at the local parish
of the Bible, often with a lot of humour thrown in, in order to captivate the
crowd. Our minister believed that this was blasphemous, so he summoned the
local Bishop to see, who not only enjoyed our shows, but told the priest
that we were making the Bible something living and dynamic, and so it was
to be encouraged.

+++: As a result, I quickly became notorious for my shows, which also
captured the attention of the local nobility, the Lords of Canterson. The
older brother, who liked me so much, became infatuated with me, courted me, and
eventually we got married.

+++: we led a happy marriage, but it was terminated shortly by the
Lord, my husband, becoming sick, and then dying. It wasn't my fault, but I was
devastated from it, and after recovering, told the Lord’s younger brother,
the now honourable Lord James Canterson, that I was going to relocate to Paris,
France, for a change of scenery. He agreed.

+++: As a result, I, as Milady Canterson arrived at Paris to try my luck in
finding a new life. I was able to make a small profit teaching English and the
English bible to many students who were eager to learn, but my social life
took a turn, to the worse, at first. You see, I kept telling the various people
at parties and other social events of my previous life as an entertainer and
also reciting some of my takes on Biblical things with improvisations. Many men
and women found it amusing and liked me, but a minority of the women started
spreading rumours that I killed my husband, and was actually glad he died,
and they were trying to put me down.

+++: At one point, I could not take it anymore, and I went to a corner couch,
sat down, and started crying. I was joined by d’Artagnan, a young (about my
age), and promising guard at the des Essarts' company of guards, who was a big
fan of me and my stories about what happened in the bible, and he asked me,

[Showing the couch]

d’Artagnan: Milady, que se passe-t-il? [ = “Milady, what's the matter?” ]

Milady Kate: Rien [ = “nothing”. She is crying.].

d’Artagnan: Il y a évidemment quelque chose qui ne va pas. Pourquoi
pleurez-vous? [ = “something is obviously the matter. Why are you crying?”]

Milady Kate: D’accord. Comme je ne porte plus le deuil et que je
semble heureuse, les autres femmes croient que j'ai tué mon mari.
[ = “OK. The other women think I killed my husband because I'm now
no longer grieving and seems happy.”]

d'Artagnan: Sottises! On peut à la fois être triste et heureux pour
des raisons différentes. [ = “nonsense. You can be sad and happy at the same
time, for two different things.” ]

Milady Kate: Oui, oui. [ = “yes. yes.”]

d'Artagnan: Laissez-moi vous dire ceci [takes her hands].  Je
comprends que vous soyez troublée, mais sachez que ces personnes ne
vous veulent que du tort et vous ne devriez pas laisser les paroles
grossières ou méprisantes vous affecter. Vous valez mieux que ça.
[= “let me tell you this . It’s OK to receive insults,
it's OK to be offended, but you need to know that ultimately the other person
is just does not mean well, and that you should not get them
to hurt you. You're better than that.”]

Milady Kate: M. d’Artagnan, vous êtes très sage pour votre âge.
[= “M. d’Artagnan, you are quite wise for your age.”]

d’Artagnan: Merci, Milady. Je tâcherai que ça ne me monte pas à la
tête. [= “thank you, Milady. I will not let it go to my head.”]

[They both smile.]

Kate’s voice: d’Artagnan and I became good friends: I taught him English
and the Bible, and he told me of some of the things he learned as a
noble, and what happened at the Guards. We ended up falling in love and having
an affair, and while we did not go public about it, we did not really hide
it and pretty soon everyone knew, and many single people and couples were
jealous or envious of us. But we didn’t care.

+++: another thing I should tell you about is the Queen. She was a beautiful
woman, but needy and jealous and wanted the King, Louis XIII, to love her,
without her doing anything to deserve it. The King and his prime minister,
Cardinal Richelieu, despised her for her incompetence, which made her feel
even more deprived of love that she supposedly deserved. I sometimes had to
provide support for some of her maids, who were offended by her abuse, and
ended up giving them d’Artagnan’s advice, which I noticed had made
them quickly lose their job, and then meeting me and telling me how relieved
they were.

+++: anyway, I was expecting D’Artagnan to propose soon after all that, when
it was announced that the conquest of La Rochelle was about to take place,
and that d’Artagnan will relocate there. I was somewhat worried for his
future, and thought we would have to part soon.

+++: However, nothing prepared me for the time when my maid woke me up in the
middle of the night and informed me that there were two of the King’s
Musketeers at the door. I wondered why. The Musketeers told me the king asked
to see me, so I wore a plain dress, and the Musketeers took me in a carriage
to the palace. They escorted me to a room where I saw the King sitting at an
armchair, as well as D’Artagnan and his friend and mentor Athos standing at
a corner.

[Showing the scene at the Palace.]

Louis XIII: [in English with a French accent] hello, Milady. You know M.
d’Artagnan and M. Athos.

Milady Kate: [a little worried] I do, nice to meet you again.

Louis XIII: please meet his eminence.

[Cardinal Richelieu turns to face them.]

Milady Kate: his eminence! Oh no, oh no… if it’s about my relationship with
M. d’Artagnan, then - it was all my fault - I can return to England, and…

Cardinal Richelieu: Milady Canterson, we have known about your affair with
M. d’Artagnan for a long time, and do not disapprove of it, but that is not why
you are here. In fact, we brought you here, in order to slay Lord Buckingham,
so he won’t interfere with our planned attack of La Rochelle.

Milady Kate: kill him?

Cardinal Richelieu: I said “slay” - not “kill”. There is a difference as you
shall see.

+++: we have failed at convincing Lord Buckingham that he should refrain from
attacking us, which will cause many innocent lives to be lost and so we
have to resort to take him out of the equation.

Louis XIII: here’s the deal: you will carry these three letters signed by his
eminence, by the King of England and by me, that will instruct whoever reads
them to do everything within reason to assist you in your mission. M. Athos
and M. d’Artagnan will escort you, and they will protect you with their lives
if necessary.

Louis XIII: The plan is: go to your house and take the belongings you
care about; take a fast carriage to Calais and cross the channel; once in
England, find some people you know to help you find a body similar to Lord
Buckingham, find someone who will take the blame for it (your King will make
sure nothing bad happens to him), slay Lord Buckingham, and take a carriage
with him to Plymouth where you will board a ship to America, and both start
a new life. Is that clear?

Milady Kate: yes, your majesty. [She bows.]

[Milady Kate, Athos and d’Artagnan leave.]

Kate’s voice: so we did it all, despite some minor setbacks, in
part due to me bitching about the whole situation. We contacted Lord
Canterson, who volunteered one of his trusted soldiers for the job.
And travelled to Portsmouth where Lord Buckingham was about to leave.

[Showing the cabin of Lord Buckingham. He is standing there. Adam enters with
a gun and points it at Lord Buckingham.]

Adam: Hello, melord! I can kill you now, but I won't.

Lord Buckingham: I believe you. What is it that you want.

[Milady Kate enters, followed by Athos, d’Artagnan and Lord Canterson who
are dragging a body.]

Milady Kate: greetings melord - we shall travel together to Plymouth, in order
to catch a ship to the New World, where we will be a couple at least until
our arrival. Consider yourself slain and reborn.

[Turns to face d’Artagnan]

Milady Kate: I guess we part now.

d’Artagnan: yes.

Milady Kate: I loved you.

d’Artagnan: I loved you too.

[They hug.]

Milady Kate: [to Lord Buckingam] shall we? [She puts her hand in his.]

Kate’s voice: we boarded the ship and started a new life at what became the
United States of America. I kept touch with Mr. George Smith, as he was now
called for a while until he no longer needed me. I was also eventually
became indoctrinated as a vampire, for whom the fact that I once slayed the
1st Duke of Buckingham was merely an anecdote.

+++: but this changed shortly after the publication of
<i>The Three Musketeers</i> in the 1840s. Having dismissed Alexandre Dumas
as a second-rate writer of popular books, I was surprised that many people
approached me in my new life as Mrs. Kate Black requesting that I shall slay
them. Eventually I found out about the novel, sent a letter to M. Dumas that
I was coming to visit him, and travelled by ship to France to meet him at
his home in Paris. This is what happened.

[Cut to Alexandre Dumas’ Home]

Dumas: Good morning, Madame Black, I have heard so much about you,
but have no idea why you would like to meet me, all of a sudden.

Kate: M. Dumas… I am going to kill you. Physically! For what you have done to
me.

Dumas: but, Madame, why?

Kate: how shall I put it? For your information, I was
once Lady Kate Canterson and…

Dumas: [interrupts her] oh, non! C’est un impossible. You are the… real
Milady de-Winter.

+++: oh, this is a great honour. Where are my manners? Milady, do you want
some cake, some biscuits, some tea? I have excellent wine too. Please sit down
[Kate reluctantly sits down. Dumas is busy doing arrangements for taking care
of his guest.]

Dumas: please, tell me all about it.

[Later on this evening.]

Kate: [drunk] M. Dumas, you treated me really well today, but now what do
we do… about… about… about the people who ask me to slay them.

M. Dumas: [not as drunk] Madame, just tell them that you no longer will slay.
That you quit being a slayer, and THAT they should deal with their troubled
life themselves.

Kate: Mr. Dumas, sounds like a good idea. You are a very wise man for your
age. [She falls asleep.]

[Cut to the morning. Kate is sleeping on a bed in Alexandre Dumas’ house.
birds are twittering outside and everything is pastoral.]

Kate: [wakes up] hmm… [hangover] ow, ow, oh! [She rises up and washes her
face.]

[Cut to a different room in Dumas’ house, he is sitting there drinking tea.]

Alexandre Dumas: bonjour, Madame Black. I see you slept well.

Kate: I did, thank you.

Alexandre Dumas: I enjoyed hearing your story last night.

Kate: and I was happy to tell it. [She pours some water and drinks it.]
Thanks for the hospitality. And for the useful piece of advice which I
now recall.

Alexandre Dumas: you are most welcome, Madame. Now please - stay for breakfast.

Kate: thank you, Monsieour. I shall stay. No wine this time, though.

[Dumas smiles and Kate laughs.]

Alexandre Dumas: OK, would you like to hear about some ideas I have for
a new novel?

[Close-up on Kate, she is grinning mischieviously.]

<s id="from-slayer-to-dispeller" title="From Slayer to Dispeler">

[Cut to the bench with Selina, Kate, Mosheh and Aharon.]

Kate: well, I quit slaying, but still maintained the status of being
The Slayer in the real world. While neither France nor England wanted to
consider Milady de-Winter as their own, they both wanted to claim me.

[Cut to Selina: she has tears of excitement.]

Selina: beautiful story.

Kate: yes, well, that was how The Slayer came to be, but now we started a
new age where dispelling is preferred. So I pass the baton for you and finally
have some peace.

[Selina hugs Kate and bursts into tears.]

Mosheh: vampirellas are cute - are they not.

Aharon: and they make the best slayers - and apparently dispellers too.

[After a while]

Selina: I’m OK, I’m OK.
