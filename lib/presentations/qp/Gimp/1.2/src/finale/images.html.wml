It is part of a Playboy centerfold and copyrighted by Playboy corporation.
The latter, however has given permission to use this particular portion freely
for image processing research.

It seems to be the colour original of the Grayscale one. Usually, the 
grayscale one is used for image processing research (probably because 
scientific journals are usually not printed in colour), but I decided to

It looks like it was scanned from a magazine, so it's almost surely 
copyrighted. However, distribtion of copyrighted images on the Internet is
so common, that I don't think one has anyting to afraid of by using this
image. Publishing it is a different story, though.

They are distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which 
I'm not sure if makes too much sense for images. They were created
using the GIMP, but the scripts or the temporary images used to create them are
not available as far as I know.
