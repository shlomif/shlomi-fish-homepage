<p>
Perl supplies two operators <tt>and</tt> and <tt>or</tt> which are equivalent
to <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt> and <tt>||</tt> except that they have a very low
precendence. (lower than any other operator in fact). There's also <tt>not</tt>
which is the ultra-low precendence equivalent of <tt>!</tt>.
</p>

<p>
You can use them after a statement to write error handlers.
