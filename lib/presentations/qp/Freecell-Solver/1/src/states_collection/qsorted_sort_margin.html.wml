<li>
I kept a sorted array of states.
</li>

<li>
New states were added to the end of the array, which was kept momentarily
unsorted.
</li>

<li>
After a few of them were collected, they were added to the main array using
qsort.
</li>

<li>
O(log(n)) lookup and O(n*log(n)) - O(n<sup><small>2</small></sup>) addition.

Reasonable performance for most boards.
