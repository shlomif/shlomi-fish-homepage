In <a href="[% base_path %]humour/Selina-Mandrake/"><i>Selina Mandrake - The Slayer</i></a>, the titular protagonist (whom I want to be
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/Selina-Mandrake/cast.html#selina">played
by Emma Watson</a>) is able to "kick ass" (or <a
href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse#Slaying_in_the_Selinaverse">“slay”
and/or “dispel”</a>) without needing
a wand or any other violent weapon.
</p>

<p>
This captioned image was originally conceived for use in
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/Terminator/Liberation/">a different screenplay</a>
and has later provided inspiration for
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/Selina-Mandrake/ongoing-text.html#the-guide-after-the-three">a
scene in <i>Selina</i></a>.
</p>

<p>
For you people lacking imagination: you can extra-figuratively “kick someone's
ass” by convincing them they had been wrong, or by winning in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Chess</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers">Checkers</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohnanza">Bohnanza</a>,

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports">electronic sports</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">Basketball</a>,
or whatever, or alternatively by enlightening someone. Literally kicking
someone’s ass involves extending a leg to hit someone’s buttocks, which isn’t
the only way to win in a brawl.
</p>

<p>
(That put aside, I don't rule out that Emma Watson is a good <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts">mixed martial arts</a>
fighter despite appearances to the contrary. Do note that while she might
get angry (which has been erroneously referred to as "verbal violence"), <a
href="[% base_path
%]meta/FAQ/featuring_sexy_women_and_girls.xhtml">she won’t intentionally
attack you out of the blue</a>, or even deliberately kick a friendly cat or
dog.)

“One does not simply cast an American actress for a Britishwoman’s role.”
</p>
[%- END -%]

<p>
This was inspired by a <a href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1174368159060627456">a Twitter conversation</a>
where some people suggested that I should consider casting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Stone">Emma Stone</a> instead of Emma Watson
for <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/cast.html#selina">the role of Selina</a>
in my <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/"><i>Selina Mandrake - The Slayer</i></a>
film.
</p>

<p>
It is not quite accurate because Renée Zellweger played Bridget Jones in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Jones%27s_Diary_(film)"><i>Bridget
Jones’ Diary</i></a>, Anne Hathaway played Jane Austen in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becoming_Jane"><i>Becoming Jane</i></a>,
Gwyneth Paltrow played an Englishwoman in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_in_Love"><i>Shakespeare in
Love</i></a>, and recently Meryl Streep played Margaret Thatcher in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Iron_Lady_%28film%29"><i>The Iron
Lady</i></a>.
</p>

<p>
The real issue is that I believe Emma Watson is the only actress who
can play Selina, and may have kind of modelled and adapted the character of
Selina after her, having deviated from my original concept.
</p>

<p>
<b>Update:</b> being the <q>do and let do</q> proponent that I am, I think
an Emma Stone take on <i>Selina Mandrake - The Slayer</i> (or a <a href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1403524835091812352">Cookie Monster one</a> or whatever)
has a potential to be both different and great.
