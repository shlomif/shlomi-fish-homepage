<h2><a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/11/04/which_wiki.html">The article itself and some discussion on ONLamp.com</a></h2>

<p>
This is an article I wrote to <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/">ONLamp.com</a>
about how various popular Open Source wiki implementations fare. A wiki is a
world-editable web-site, and wikis have become increasingly popular lately.
