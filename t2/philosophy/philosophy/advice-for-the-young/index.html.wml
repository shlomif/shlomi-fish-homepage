<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
There used to be a common meme to offer advice to high school and college
students. Here is my advice, based on what I know, and practice:
</p>

<h2 id="live_and_learn">“Live like you were going to die tomorrow; Learn 
like you were going to live forever”</h2>

<p>
This is the single best piece of advice one could give, but you’d amazed how
many people defy it. (It’s attributed to 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi">Mahatma 
Gandhi</a>.) Most people I know
don’t seem to have time for anything. They are crowded with responsiblities.
“We’re too busy”, they say.
</p>

<p>
I’m not too busy, and never will be. When I worked or studied I also was never
too busy to talk to people I liked or met at that time; to work on open source
software and web sites; to relax; to help people with their computer problems.
I became relatively popular. More people knew me by name than I could recall
them. (including some very pretty girls, albeit with them I usually recalled
their names eventually). Everyone knew I was one of the resident UNIX gurus. It
was fun.
</p>

<p>
I treasure the few people who always answer my E-mails on time, always have
time to chat on the phone, unless they have a previous engagement. Know well
enough that one doesn’t become productive by 
<a href="http://www.igda.org/articles/erobinson_crunch.php">working more than 
40 hours a week</a>, and always say “I’ll do it when I have some spare cycles” instead of “I don’t have time to do it.”
</p>

<p>
You must be able to dedicate some time for your top priorities because you are
going to die tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
And there are people who refuse to learn anything. They don’t have time and
think that by not learning and acquiring new skills, they’ll still be
successful. Java people think Java is the best thing since sliced bread and
don’t learn Perl, Python or Ruby. C++ people don’t know how straightforward
and painless Object-Oriented programming is in high-level languages.
Programmers who are used to Perl 4 writing Perl 5 scripts the Perl 4 way,
despite knowing Perl 5 pretty well. The list goes on.
</p>

<p>
Such persons are the worst. They may be pretty good at what they do, but
they’ll never get better, and will maintain their code in a language that will
become deprecated and then have to learn something new after not practicing
their learning skills for a long time.
</p>

<h2 id="recommended_writings">Writings to Learn and Integrate</h2>

<p>
Learn and Integrate the following things. By integrate, I meat take the time 
to digest and don’t reject as absurd on the spot. Note that you have to <b>read 
them from cover to cover</b> and not to skip in between, otherwise you’ll
get a lot of false impressions.

<h2 id="windows_is_dead">Windows will be dead; Microsoft may or may not Die with it.</h2>

<p>
I put my money that practically the majority of people would switch to
UNIX-based OSes (most notably the various distributions of Linux and Mac
OS X) a few years from now. Linux nay-sayers are having less and less good
arguments to support Linux that “just works”, is easier to use, requires less
constant maintenance, and have so many technical advantages over Windows that
enumerating all of them here would be not possible. 
</p>

<p>
Just search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22linux%20vs.%20windows%22">“Linux vs. Windows”</a> or 
“Open Source vs. Windows.”. Windows is trying 
to catch up but usually gives solutions that are either buggy at first or
not as integrated, or not as good or worse, or simply too little too
late. In Microsoft conferences, the Microsofties are notorious for getting
excited about new Windows features that Linux and other UNIXes has had for
years. The Win32 API is horrible and very programmer unfriendly, while the 
various Unix APIs are in very good shape.
</p>

<p>
Windows Vista will come without any of the features that were most
publicized. Development on Windows is slowing to a halt. Meanwhile development
on the various components that make a Linux system is progressing at a greater
and greater speed. There seems to be a huge shortage in clueful Linux workers
at least here in Israel. No-one can find any. Linux is hot.
</p>

<p>
Microsoft will probably survive. It has .NET which is very portable. (either
the proprietary version by Microsoft which runs fine on FreeBSD, or the
open-source Mono.) It also has many other good products and some decent APIs
that can be ported to Linux. And as
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html">Joel Spolsky
notes</a> it still has a lot of space to manuever, having a lot of money
in the bank and being very profitable, and can still end up re-inventing
itself into something else.
</p>

<p>
But Windows is dead. It does not mean it will not be used for years to come
in various forms (just like Novell NetWare, DOS, Mac OS Classic, and other
dead OSes can still be encountered in various places), but it will still
be dead.
</p>

<p>
I’m not as 
<a href="http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/16376/index.html">paranoid as 
ESR is</a> about what Microsoft will do next. I think they
will simply embrace Linux, and port their software to run on it. 
</p>

<p>
Why is all that important? Because you’d better learn Unix now rather than
later, knowing that it is going to be the future of computing.
</p>

<h2 id="technologies_to_learn">Learn Many Different and Orthogonal 
Technologies</h2>

<p>
You should learn the following languages and technologies:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/">HTML</a> and XHTML.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://perl-begin.berlios.de/">Perl</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language">The C Programming
Language</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">Bash</a> or 
<a href="http://www.zsh.org/">Zsh</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a>
</li>
<li>
The Assembly of one or more architectures.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language">Lisp</a> and
<a href="http://www.schemers.org/">Scheme</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://xml.com/">XML</a> and related technologies (but not all).
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> and 
<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/">O’Caml</a>
</li>
<li>
Matlab or a similar tool for bulk operations on tensors, like Perl’s
<a href="http://pdl.perl.org/">PDL</a> or Python’s SciPy.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are languages I recommend you to learn. They were the languages that
provided me with the most inspiration and insights. I don’t like all of them
as much as I do others, but they are nonetheless truly enlightening. I believe
Perl or Python (etc.) are the most useful of them, and also the most suitable 
for learning as a first programming language.
</p>

<p>
Another point is to learn about the design of digital circuits (out of logical
gates and Flip-flops, not the transistor composition of them) and about
computer architectures. Too many programmers don’t have a good understanding
of a how a computer really works, which ends up showing in sub-optimal code.
</p>

<h2 id="growth_death">Always reverse your growth death.</h2>

<p>
Growth death means you’ve stopped to grow, and become more cynical as time
goes by and less capable. It is unnecessary because some people have never
had growth death in their entire life time, while one of my friends already 
had it in his mid-to-late twenties. I never experienced growth death, and 
still grow in my skills, capability and productivity. You should too.
</p>

<p>
There are no caveats. Either you grow or you don’t. And nothing necessitates
that you don’t grow. People in concentration camps sometimes never stopped
growing, and often experienced spiritual or intellectual enlightenings.
</p>

<p>
It doesn’t matter how many responsibilities you have, you never have to stop
growing. I have been corresponding with a man in his late 70’s , who is still 
programming, travels a lot, is very active, and is otherwise very enthusiastic 
about life. So he also still has a living growth.
</p>

<h2 id="proper_language">Speak and Write Properly in English and in your Mother Tongue</h2>

<p>
This is something that Eric S. Raymond suggests in “How to become a Hacker”, but many people still ignore. Speaking in a language with
many mistakes, will cause people to look down on you, and they’ll
immediately notice the problems in what you speak. Whenever I write something
in either English or Hebrew, I make sure to phrase myself properly. Whenever
I learn of a new Hebrew common mistake, I immediately register it, and notice
it from then onward. I never consciously write it, and try to correct myself
if I utter it improperly. Other people whom I constantly remark on improper
language, still make these mistakes, and I wonder how much conscious effort
they put into their writing.
</p>

<p>
Note that all-lowercase writing, while acceptable on the IRC (albeit I
do not write this way either) is completely frowned upon in E-mails, and 
leaves an impression of lack of professionality, no time and care to press the 
shift key, and general disinterest. Don’t do it. Putting such improperly-written
language on the Web is even more harmful. (And often mailing lists 
are archived on the Web for posterity).
</p>

<h2 id="history">Learn History in General and the History of Computing in 
Particular</h2>

<p>
Paul Graham <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html">recommends that 
people learn History but not so much political
history, but cultural, technological and artistic history</a>. He’s right in a 
way. Knowing who conquered who at what time is quite useless. Knowing how 
things developed and how people thought or behaved at the time, or what 
happened is actually useful and enlightening.
</p>

<p>
Many people graduate from Computer Science degrees, hardly knowing anything
about Computer history. They are familiar with Knuth, Dijkstra and other great
names, only througout the algorithms they have formulated, and are not familiar
with when things came to being, or why they are this way at all. There are many
good resources for learning about computer history on the Net, and you should
probably read them. Chatting on the IRC in the appropriate channels can also
help you learn more about it.
