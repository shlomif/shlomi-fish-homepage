Here is what’s new on
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish’s
    Homepage</a> since the last update. It’s been a month and there are many
major changes.
</p>

<p>
A new work-in-progress screenplay titled
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selena-Mandrake/"><i>Selena Mandrake
        - The Slayer</i></a> can be found in the stories section. This is a
supernatural dramedie, that is a parody/tribute/spin-off of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer">Buffy the
    Vampire Slayer</a> and some other works of fiction and non-fiction. I have
a pretty good roadmap for what I’d like to write there so I hope to get the
first draft soon.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Selena:</strong> This reminds me. I really should update my Mandriva system at home.
I have not in several days, now. And to think I originally had my friend
Aaron install Mandrake Linux for me, because I thought it was cool that
it was called the same as my last name.
</p>
<p><strong>Jessica:</strong> Heh, maybe you should become Selena Mandriva now.
</p>

<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Or Selena Mageia.
</p>
<p>
[
Selena bursts out laughing.
]
</p>

<p><strong>Selena:</strong> That sounds like a name of a vampire slayer… or a vampire.
</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Or both.
</p>

<p><strong>Selena:</strong> Yeah. I told you about how I was nicknamed “Puffy” and then “Buffy”
during one summer camp, right?
</p>
<p><strong>Jessica:</strong> Yes, many times.
</p>

<p><strong>Selena:</strong> Yeah, I found it amusing at the time. For a while afterwards, I
insisted that my friends call me “Buffy” until I realised it was silly, and
reverted back to “Selena”.
</p>

<p>
I’ve also began translating the second version of my novella
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/"><i>The Human Hacking
        Field Guide</i></a> to Hebrew. One can find
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/hebrew-v2.html">the ongoing
    Hebrew translation</a> and its
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/human-hacking-field-guide-hebrew-v2.txt">Fiction-Text source</a>, under CC-by-sa - same licence
as the English original. In addition, I can say that the story is being
translated to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Standard_Arabic">Modern Standard
    Arabic</a> in the OpenDocument format by an Egyptian enthusiast of
open-source software, and more translations will be welcome.
</p>

<p>
In addition to all that, version 7 of my novella
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/"><i>The Enemy
        and How I Helped to Fight It</i></a>, in Hebrew and English, with many
improvements is now available online. I especially would like to thank
<a href="http://www.miriamereztranslations.co.il/">Miriam Erez Translations</a>
for providing some copy-editing work.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, I explicitly marked
many of the <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/">the works of fiction</a>
on the site, <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/">the essays</a>,
and the <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/">software resources</a>
with a Creative Commons licence. Share and enjoy!

<p>
There are some style tweaks, I’ve documented the use of the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/#evilphish-emblem">EvilPHish
    emblem</a>, and there are some new
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">fortune cookies</a>:
