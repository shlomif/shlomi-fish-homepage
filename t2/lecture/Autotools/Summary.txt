Autoconf/Automake/Libtool Lecture Summary:
------------------------------------------

* Introduction:

    - The de-facto standard for portably building C and C++ applications.
    - Supports all UNIX platforms as well as Microsoft Win32.
    - As far as the installer is concerned depends on nothing but
    a Bourne shell, a C compiler, and a standard "make" program.
    - The developer requires other tools such as the Autoconf package
    , Perl, the automake package and m4.

* How it all fits together:
    - Automake takes as input Makefile.am and produces Makefile.in
    - The "autoconf" program takes as input the file configure.in (or in
    Autoconf 2.5 the file configure.ac) and generates the ./configure script
    out of it.
    - ./configure, when ran by the user generates the normal "Makefile"
    out of "Makefile.in" and optionally processes other files (such as
    config.h.in -> config.h, an optional RPM Spec, Makefiles in other
    directories, etc)

* A simple project:
    - Show the pthread_rwlock and explain it

* Commonly used configure.in macros:
    AC_DEFINE / AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED
    AC_CHECK_LIB
    AC_ARG_ENABLE
    AC_OUTPUT
    AC_CHECK_FUNCS
    AC_CHECK_HEADERS

* configure.in : changequote(, ) and changequote([, ])

* Commonly used configure.in variables:
    CFLAGS

* Format of Makefile.am
    - bin_PROGRAMS
    - bin_SCRIPTS
    - prog_SOURCES
    - prog_LDADD
    - EXTRA_DIST
    - man_MANS
    - lib_LTLIBRARIES
    - prog_la_LDFLAGS
    - proginclude_HEADERS
    - Vanilla targets

* Format of config.h.in

Issues:
-------

* Creating a sub-directory with a different configuration:
    - SUBDIRS variable in automake
    - (cd $mydir && ./configure --prefix="$prefix")

* Creating a mylibrary-config program

* Creating an RPM Spec
