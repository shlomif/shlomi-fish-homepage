        <h2>Foreword</h2>
        <p>
        I don't normally support open-sourcing commercial software. I don't
        think Microsoft Excel should be open-sourced. I don't think Corel-Draw
        should be open-sourced either. I like Matlab, but I would not recommend
        the Mathworks to open-source it anytime soon. I like all of them and I 
        think both should remain proprietary.
        </p>
        <p>
        BitKeeper, however is different. BitKeeper would benefit a lot from
        being open-sourced, and in fact: that choice would determine its 
        future.
        </p>
        <h2>BitKeeper should be GPLed - for BitMover's sake</h2>

        <p>
        Linus Torvalds and other Linux Kernel developers decided to use 
        BitKeeper, despite the fact that it is proprietary. As a result,
        the Linux developers body and the Linux Kernel mailing list has
        been split into two parts: those that support using BitKeeper,
        and those that are against it on the premise that it is proprietary.
        </p>
        <p>
        Larry McVoy, BitKeeper's colourful developer, has so far insisted on
        not open-sourcing BitKeeper, saying it will make his company bankrupt. 
        However, this is not the case, and the entire frustration involved with
        dealing with those people who insist on freeing it can be avoided.
        </p>
        <p>
        I hereby give reasons why 
        <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.com/">BitMover</a>, would be better off
        GPLing BitKeeper. It has nothing to do with whatever free software
        ideals I hold - they are pure strategic ones.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Source Control is like an OS - A Copy on Every Machine</h3>

        <p>
        Computer vendors would not dream installing RedHat Linux or Mandrake
        Linux on their customers' computers without paying RedHat or 
        MandrakeSoft for a license. But it is perfectly legal to do the 
        opposite.
        </p>

        <p>
        The same holds for source control. Sure, many users will download it
        and use it without charge. But every manager in a company will insist
        that if BitMover mandates a license, then it would be present. That's
        the law of the land.
        </p>

        <p>
        Those that break it are not really a concern of BitMover. They would
        have broken it, anyhow.
        </p>
        
        <h3>BitKeeper is a Platform</h3>

        <p>
        Refer to the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Platforms.html">Platform article</a> 
        written by everybody's favourite software management guru, 
        <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a>. BitKeeper
        is a platform, and the evidence is now that BitMover is building a 
        bug database based on it. As such, BitMover must make sure it propagates
        everywhere, before a better alternative becomes commonplace instead.
        </p>
        
        <h3>You can't eat your cake and have it too</h3>
        <p>
        Most open-source developers out there won't use BitKeeper under
        the terms dictated by BitMover. There's nothing wrong with this
        idealism - it is perfectly rational.
        </p>
        <p>
        If BitMover wishes that Free Software developers would use BitKeeper,
        it must make it free software. Like it or not, but people as fanatic
        as Richard Stallman are not that uncommon (nor do I believe they are
        irrational), and even I do not wish to have a discipline of keeping
        my repositories free software.
        </p>
        <p>
        As far as compliance to the free software ideals, BitKeeper has gone
        from pretty good to bad to worse. Most developers out there feel
        they cannot trust BitMover, and so will not use it.
        </p>

        <h3>The Market for BitKeeper is very large - end users</h3>

        <p>
        Aunt Tillie could use source control. Many clue-less users out
        there invent ad-hoc methodologies to keep various versions of there
        files, and they all work much less better than CVS, and even less
        than BitKeeper.
        </p>

        <p>
        With good marketing and integration into the underlying desktop,
        BitKeeper can be marketed as a tool everybody could use.
        </p>

        <h3>Advantages of the Bazaar Style</h3>

        <p>
        Larry can criticize Eric Raymond's "The Cathedral and the Bazaar"
        as much as he wants. Fact is, everybody else beside him (and beside
        some sources in Microsoft who have any reason to attack CatB) thought
        it was a ground-breaking paper.
        </p>

        <p>
        BitMover can benefit from the Bazaar style while still maintaining
        full ownership and control on BitKeeper. It is obvious that CVS has
        more activity geared towards it than BitKeeper has: ViewCVS, Cervisia,
        WinCVS, MacCVS, Meta-CVS and <a href="http://freshmeat.net/search/?q=cvs">an entire Freshmeat search for CVS</a>. Due to the fact the source of BitKeeper
        is not revealed, the culture around it is much less lively. The only 
        way to remedy it is to open-source BitKeeper.
        </p>

        <h3>Trust is more important than Money</h3>

        <p>
        Larry, it is obvious you don't trust the BitKeeper user-base at large.
        Lack of trust makes one paranoid. And paranoia makes one unhappy. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You should ask yourself if you're happy. You did not seem happy to 
        me when you (and your employees) attacked me for my attempts to free
        BitKeeper. You also don't seem happy to the masses of the Linux Kernel
        mailing list who have to put up with your constant flood of messages
        there.
        </p>

        <h2>Afterward</h2>

        <p>
        Mr. McVoy, you hold the future to BitKeeper in your hands. If it is
        not made free software, it will become just a footnote in the history
        of Source Control systems. Like SCCS, like Perforce or like ClearCase.
        I can guarantee you 100% that a different open-source SCM will take
        its place.
        </p>

        <p>
        However, if it does become GPL or something similar, then it can grow
        into something wonderful. A source-control management that has
        yet to be seen and that will rule for many years to come. But you have
        to make the decision.
        </p>

        <p>
        The status quo will only lead you to many anxieties and unhappiness. If
        you wish to give away all free software users do so, and make sure 
        BitKeeper is completely proprietary and is not targeted at 
        open-source developers. In which case it would become the second 
        ClearCase. (only perhaps better)
        </p>

        <p>
        Everyone who knows you enough can tell you routinely blame your own
        problems on other factors, and that you have a complete distrust of
        the people of the world out there. These are both very bad signs: they
        show of immaturity, irrationality and mysticism. You are also entirely
        flame-bait about mentioning the license, or in comparison with 
        open-source alternatives. (some of which believe are superior to 
        BitKeeper)
        </p>
        <p>
        Trust, peace of mind, happiness, and idealism are much more important
        than getting a lot of money. If you have a milliard dollars and have
        neither of them, then you are not going to be a happy man. I should
        note that I am a Neo-Tech person, who is very much an Objectivist. As
        such we hold money as sacred, but still value happiness more. And like
        I said earlier, I think GPLing BitKeeper will only bring you much more
        money in the long run.
