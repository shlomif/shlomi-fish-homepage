<a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Cheerilee">Cheerilee</a> is addressing
the pupils in Ponyville's school.

Cheerilee: OK, everypony in order to prepare you for your story-writing-assignment, I invited a guest lecturer from Chaosville University. Please welcome Professor <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Discord">Discord</a> Ph.D.!

Discord: thank you, Ms. Cheerilee. Just for the record, I am an MCSE [ = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Certified_Professional">Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert</a> ], not a Ph.D.

+++: anyway, one observation on story-writing my colleagues and I came up with, and which seems logical, is that most good stories describe one or more problems which need to be reconciled. Some examples:

+++: 1. The Israelites wish to find a way to defeat Goliath, a tall Philistine giant, and so win the battle. [ <a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Missiles_vs_Melee_Motif/">Reference</a>. ]

+++: 2. Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit, is recruited to assist a band of dwarves reclaim their ancestors' home from the dragon Smaug; he wishes to accomplish that while remaining alive and healthy. [ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit">Reference</a>. ]

+++: 3. Theseus wishes to kill the Minotaur of Crete, so it will stop killing the youth of Athens. [ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur">Reference</a>. ]

+++: Like my colleagues like to say: “One does not simply start a story with ‘And they all lived happily ever after’”.
