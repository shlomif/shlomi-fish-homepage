<h1>Program to check if two graphs have the same topology</h1>

<p>
<a href="GraphIso.pm">GraphIso.pm</a> - This is the main module with the
function that does the comparison.
</p>

<p>
<a href="Graphs_Equal.pl">Graphs_Equal.pl</a> - a test program that uses
the GraphIso module and runs on several test graphs. They can be generated
by gen_graphs.pl below.
</p>

<p>
<a href="gen_graphs.pl">gen_graphs.pl</a> - This is the script that
generates some sample graphs for input to the program. It does so in a
platform-independant way.
</p>

<p>
<a href="test.pl">test.pl</a> - This script runs Graphs_Equal.pl and
gen_graphs.pl consecutively for a series of seeds. To run it type 
"echo [initial seed] > seed.txt".
</p>

<p>
<a href="gen_graphs.c">gen_graphs.c</a> - Same as gen_graphs.pl only in C,
which makes it much faster. I have no intentions on porting the main code to
C until I find that the algorithm is valid.
</p>

<p>
<a href="Docs/Description.txt">Description.txt</a> - a description of the
algorithm in English, in case the comments and the code are not enough.
Also, some complexity analysis and notes.
