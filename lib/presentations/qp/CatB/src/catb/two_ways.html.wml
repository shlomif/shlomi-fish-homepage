Raymond distinguishes between two ways of managing a software project: the
traditional "Cathedral" way, and the novel "Bazaar" way.
</li>
<li>
In the Cathedral way, the software is developed by a limited number of
developers, released only when being very stable, and maintained without
too much help from the outside.
</li>
<li>
In the Bazaar way, the software is released very often (often in a buggy
state), tasks are delegated and contributions from the outside are welcome
and often.
</li>
<li>
ESR attributes the "invention" of the Bazaar way to Linus Torvalds who used
it to develop the Linux kernel, a core component of a critical system - the
GNU/Linux operating system. (albeit acknowledges that it was used before for
other projects)
</li>
<li>
In "the Cathedral and the Bazaar" he documents his experiences in developing
and maintaining his own project Bazaar-style: the
<esr:homesite:link href="fetchmail/">fetchmail</esr:homesite:link>
POP-retrieval system.
