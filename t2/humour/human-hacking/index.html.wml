<p>
Jennifer is a trendy and popular high school senior who is living and
studying in the vicinity of Los Angeles. Her best friend, Taylor, convinces her
to try to become a developer of open source software. He puts her
under the tutorship of a different friend of his, the female open source
contributor Eve, who prefers to be called “Erisa”, and who is a self-conscious
and rebelling punk, with whom Jennifer finds it hard to deal. Jennifer remains
determined to learn how to become an open source developer from Eve, but
there are some surprises along the road.

<b>Update:</b> (12 April, 2011) there’s now a new
<a href="#version_2">version 2</a> of the story with some improvements to
the plot and style, and it’s now written using version 5 of DocBook/XML. I’m
planning some smaller future improvements, but it should be OK as it is.

If you enjoyed the story, but still think you can do better, I would love to
see more spin-offs, from making the story a little different, to writing
sequels, prequels, etc. to video or audio versions of it. If you find
the CC-by-sa too permissive or too restrictive to license the derivative
work under, then <a href="$(ROOT)/me/contact-me/">drop me
a line</a> and we may be able to negotiate a better, commercial, licence.
