<p>
Mageia is my Linux distribution of choice. In the Linux world, distributions
are a collection of the Linux kernel and user-land utilities and libraries
in a nice packaging. Mageia is an open-source distribution with good ties
into the community, which started as a fork of Mandriva Linux (which in
turn used to be called “Linux Mandrake”). It is especially suitable for
use on the desktop, but is also suitable for running Internet and
Intranet servers.
</p>

<p>
While not as hyped as other distributions are, Mageia is very decent, and
is suitable for both beginner and advanced users.

User-mode Linux is a port of the Linux kernel to run as a process on top of a
normal operating system. This is very useful for virtualisation, security,
