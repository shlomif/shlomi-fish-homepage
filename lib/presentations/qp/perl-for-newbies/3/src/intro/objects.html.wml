<p>
An object is a set of variables and functions that are associated with
this set. By calling these functions (commonly referred to as methods) 
one automatically has access to all the variables of the set. That 
way, it is possible to create and manage several instances of objects 
of the same class.
</p>

<p>
In Perl, every class resides in its own namespace. Perl enables various
associations to be performed on entire classes. For instance, one class
can inherit one or more classes, and thus have access to all of their 
methods.

<p>
By making a set of perl functions into a class, it is possible to make sure,
they can be instantized and re-used. Furthermore, this class can later be
expanded into a more powerful class, by making another class inherit it.
