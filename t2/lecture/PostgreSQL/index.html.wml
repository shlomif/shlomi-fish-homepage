<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This is a presentation I gave about
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">the PostgreSQL relational database
server</a>, after having had some experience with it. Someone person who was
very knowledgable about Postgres attended the presentation and gave some
useful commentary on it, which I did not integrate yet.
