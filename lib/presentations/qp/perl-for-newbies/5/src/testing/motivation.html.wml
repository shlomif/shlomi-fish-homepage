So what are the motivation factors for automated software testing? The
first is to prevent bugs. By writing tests before we write the code itself
(so-called <b>Test-First Development</b>) we ascertain that the code behave
according to the specification given in the tests. That way, bugs that could
occur if the code was deployed right away or tested immediately would be
prevented.
</p>

<p>
Another reason is to make sure bugs and regressions do not occur again. Say we
have a bug, and we write a meaningful test that fails when the bug is still
in the code, and only then fix the bug. In that case, we can re-use the test
in the future to make sure the bug is not present in the current version
of the code. If the bug will re-surface in a certain variation, then it is
likely it will be caught by the test.
</p>

<p>
Finally, by writing tests we provide specifications to the code and even
some form of API documentation, as well as examples of what we want the code 
to achieve. This causes less duplication than writing separate specification
documents and examples, and furthermore, is validated to be functional.
