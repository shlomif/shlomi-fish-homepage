<p>
In Perl we use the <code>print</code> command to echo strings and expressions
to the screen.
</p>

<p>
The neophyte "Hello World!" program can be written in perl as follows:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/output/hello.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>Now here's some explanation (in case you need any):</p>

<ol>
<li>
The string is enclosed in double-quotes(<code>" ... "</code>) because that's how
string constants are represented in perl.
</li>

<li>
<code>\n</code> is a special character that is called "newline". When you print a
newline you will see that your output started on a new line.
</li>

<li>
The semi-colon (<code>;</code>) at the end indicates that this is the end of
a perl command. Every perl command should be terminated with a semicolon.
</li>
</ol>
