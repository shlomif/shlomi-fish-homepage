A Jewish Deduction

The Bible dictates that "Thou shalt not seethe [= cook] a kid [= young goat]
in his mother's milk." To avoid any possibility of breaking that regulation,
the Jewish tradition ruled that it also applies to female goats, to mature
goats, and to the meat and milk of two completely unrelated goats. It is
also forbidden to eat the meat with fresh milk, and it applies to beef
and mutten as well (including mixing the milk and meat of two different
beasts). Finally, chicken, which are incapable of milk production, may not
be eaten along with any mammal's milk either.

We are fortunate that most mathematicians were not Jewish. Otherwise, it
would have been forbidden to divide by all numbers between -1 and 1.

Suggested Improvements to the Documentation:

The WYSIWYT project was for a long time fascinated by Microsoft's tremendous
desire to advance its Internet Explorer web-browser. We saw the fact that
they switched the help systems of the upcoming Windows 98, as well as
Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0, to HTML a major step in advancing our project.

As a complementary step, some of the chief heads of our project suggested
that the Windows' manuals themselves, as well as all of Microsoft's ads,
will be designed in HTML and printed after being rendered by IE4. While this
project is in the preliminary and planning stages, we expect it to acquire a
large momentum soon.

Yeah and what are the offerings of the open-source world? Let's see:

2. Richard M. Stallman - a hippy. How girly is that?
3. Eric S. Raymond - a nice looking man with a mustache. Baby faced, so he
looks a bit girly to me.
4. Larry Wall - a cross between Linus and RMS (i.e: a hippy dweeb) that is
even more girly.

      <buubot>  Perl 6, unlike most people, is able to breathe in the
                vacuum of space. In fact, anything else would damage its
                respiratory system. Because of this, whenever it's
                visiting Earth, it wears a respirator, which resembles a

Are you kidding?

CVS is not advanced as:

1. Microsoft Visual SourceSafe - the only sane choice for good data integrity
and portability.

2. tarballs/zip-files and patches. This one excels in convenience, and
robustness.

CVS is a very advanced version control system, however. I do wish that
Subversion (which is a VCS that I have to use against my will) was as good as
it is.

  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: what's up?
  <Mahmoud>  rindolf, writing a CMS from scratch with perl.. really
             cool, making my own template engine
  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: why???
  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: use TT2.
  <rindolf>  Or whatever.
  <Mahmoud>  rindolf, i dislike other CMS engines.. they are bloated and
             i don't trust them
  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: TT2 is pure perl.
          *  Mahmoud looks for TT2
  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: a CMS doesn't stay simple forever.
  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: and a CMS != Templating system.
  <Mahmoud>  rindolf, the template engine is quite simple, it's similar
             to how SimpleMachines forum does its templates
  <Mahmoud>  rindolf, just an external file with print 'foo'; commands
 <amnesiac>  Mahmoud, TT2 is very powerful
 <amnesiac>  Mahmoud, there are more templating systems, why not use any
             ofo the existing ones?
  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: please don't re-invent square wheels.
  <Mahmoud>  heh..
  <NOTevil>  oval!
          *  amnesiac likes hexagonal wheels
  <NOTevil>  very small octagon wheels aren't too bad.
  <rindolf>  amnesiac: triangular wheels are the best!

 <f00li5h>  so now wikipedia is a verb?
 <rindolf>  f00li5h: it's gonna enter the OED.
 <rindolf>  f00li5h: in English every verb can be nounified and every

            it

            Objectivism.

     <jql>  you shouldn't noun up a verb that's been nouned already
 <rindolf>  And the study of Objectivism is Objectivistalism.

A few weeks ago, I've been to Freenode's #perl, talking to merlyn and other
guys, when we got to discuss the Biblical "Tower of Babel Myth". As it turned
out, the commonly perceived interpretation was not the one most scholars find
as more sensible, which is the one we ended up being taught at Junior High
School.

What most people think is something like that:

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The people spoke to each other in the same language, concentrated in one place,
and decided to build a tower high enough so they can reach God. God, a small
dwarf who lived in the sky, was afraid of the efforts of these people, because
he feared they'll reach him. So he casted an 8th level Spell of Language
Fragmentation, caused these people to speak in different tongues, and without
being able to understand each other, they ended up spreading across the Earth.
God was relieved and returned to his dwarfish deeds, as dwarfs do.

No. 1 is true, naturally. No. 2 is not true - I know LISP but I prefer Perl.
Other like Python, etc. The reasons I don't prefer LISP are:

1. The standards of Common LISP and Scheme don't define anything practical.
2. LISP is at the moment incredibly verbose.
3. As Larry Wall noted, all LISP code comes in parenthesis and so it all looks
the same. (Perl is the exact opposite in this regard).
4. I cannot make heads nor tails of serious LISP code. Many LISPers create so
many macros and use them along with regular LISP code, so you keep having to
refer to the previous definitions, and make a lot of research to get you
started.

SICP Scheme is easy and fun. But serious LISP code can take too much time to
understand. OTOH, recently I had little problem reading the source code of
other Perl programmers, and extending it or fixing bugs. (likewise for
Python).

* Two Evolution recommendations.
* One Sylpheed Claws recommendation.

The problem is that I wasn't interested to learn about alternative E-mail

completely out of the question due to my work's constraints.

RTFM vs. JATFM
--------------

I recently had to figure out how to do something with wget: get everything
below a directory on the web-server, without following links to outside it. So
I logged in to FreeNode's #debian channel, where there are many knowledgable
people to ask it. The first answer I got was "RTFM". So, I read the wget man
page, but could not find it there. Eventually, after telling people that it
would be faster to give an answer, I got a reply ( add the -np -r flags). But
this has been the last straw.

I composed my own acronym. Just like RTFM is "Read the Fabulous Manual" and
STFW is "Search the Fabulous Web", then JATFM is "Just Answer the Fabulous
Man". It means that it's usually faster to answer someone's question than to
ask him to RTFM, which is just going to annoy him. I think the RTFM mantra has
done a lot of damage in the UNIX/Linux world, and I hope JATFMing would prove
to be a more healthy ideology.

 <rbastic>  or is that something I'm remembering from some other

 <rbastic>  i remember booting up the old app for the first time, and
            being amazed at how slow it was

 <rindolf>  rbastic: you mean the Java app is faster? :S

I don't suppose we should propose that as an alternative to Perl Gods, there
should at least be Perl Saints:

http://www.stallman.org/saint.html

Of course, I'm not sure what being a Perl saint would imply. Using nothing but
Perl? (Including not C in which perl 5 is written?)

Oh well.

Not that I mind the Perl Gods stereotype stuff.

        Shlomi Fish (a Perl saint^W hero wannabe, but definitely
        not a Perl God)

I almost feel honor bound now to start a noise band called The Randal
Schwartz Condition.  I could shout his rants into a microphone while
the rest of the band flogged a newbie live on stage.
