        <h1>Why BitKeeper should be Open-Sourced Now</h1>

        <h2>Foreword</h2>
        <p>
        I don't normally support open-sourcing commercial software. I don't
        think Microsoft Excel should be open-sourced. I don't think Corel-Draw
        should be open-sourced either. I like them both and I think both should
        remain proprietary.
        </p>
        <p>
        BitKeeper, however is different. BitKeeper would benefit a lot from
        being open-sourced, and in fact: that choice would determine its 
        future.
        </p>
        <h2>My BitKeeper Story</h2>
        <h2>BitKeeper should be GPLed - for BitMover's sake</h2>
        <h3>Source Control is like an OS - A Copy on Every Machine</h3>

        <p>
        Computer vendors would not dream installing RedHat Linux or Mandrake
        Linux on their customers' computers without paying RedHat or 
        MandrakeSoft for a license. But it is perfectly legal to do the 
        opposite.
        </p>

        <p>
        The same holds for source control. Sure, many users will download it
        and use it without charge. But every manager in a company will insist
        that if BitMover mandates a license, then it would be present. That's
        the law of the land.
        </p>

        <p>
        Those that break it are not really a concern of BitMover. They would
        have broken it, anyhow.
        </p>
        
        <h3>BitKeeper is a Platform</h3>

        <p>
        Refer to the Platform article written by everybody's favourite
        software management guru, Joel Spolsky.
        </p>
        
        <h3>You can't eat your cake and have it too</h3>
        <p>
        Most open-source developers out there won't use BitKeeper under
        the terms dictated by BitMover. There's nothing wrong with this
        idealism - it is perfectly rational.
        </p>
        <p>
        If BitMover wishes to 

        <h3>The Market for BitKeeper is very large - end users</h3>

        <p>
        Aunt Tillie could use source control. Many clue-less users out
        there invent ad-hoc methodologies to keep various versions of there
        files, and they all work much less better than CVS, and even less
        than BitKeeper.
        </p>

        <p>
        With good marketing and integration into the underlying desktop,
        BitKeeper can be marketed as a tool everybody could use.
        </p>

        <h3>Advantages of the Bazaar Style</h3>

        <p>
        Larry can criticize Eric Raymond's "The Cathedral and the Bazaar"
        as much as he wants. Fact is, everybody else beside him (and beside
        some sources in Microsoft who have any reason to attack him) thought
        it was a ground-breaking paper.
        </p>

        <p>
        BitMover can benefit from the Bazaar style while still maintaining
        full ownership and control on BitKeeper.
        </p>

        <h3>Trust is more important than Money</h3>

        <p>
        Larry, it is obvious you don't trust the BitKeeper user-base at large.
        Lack of trust makes one paranoid. And paranoia makes one unhappy. 
        </p>

        <p>
        You should ask yourself if you're happy. You did not seem happy to 
        me when you (and your employees) attacked me for my attempts to free
        BitKeeper. You also don't seem happy to the masses of the Linux Kernel
        mailing list who have to put up with your constant flood of messages
        there.
        </p>

        <h2>Afterward</h2>

        <p>
        Mr. McVoy, you hold the future to BitKeeper in your hands. If it is
        not made free software, it will become just a footnote in the history
        of Source Control systems. Like SCCS, like Perforce or like ClearCase.
        I can guarantee you 100% that a different open-source SCM will take
        its place.
        </p>

        <p>
        However, if it does become GPL or something similar, then it can grow
        into something wonderful. A source-control management that has
        yet to be seen and that will rule for many years to come. But you have
        to make the decision.
