The slides for 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Mojolicious/" rel="nofollow">a
    presentation I've given about the Mojolicious::Lite web-development
    micro-framework</a> are now online.
</p>

The <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/no-ie/" rel="nofollow">"Stop 
    Using Internet Explorer!"</a> was enhanced with two new links and the
browser coverage there was updated.

<p>
There's now 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/favourite/#other_lists" rel="nofollow">a
    collection of other high-quality lists of open source software</a> on my
favourite free software page.

Here is 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Freecell-Solver-Enterprise-Edition/" rel="nofollow">a 
    stub page for the "Announcing Freecell Solver™ Enterprise Edition" bit</a>.

<p>
The <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/" rel="nofollow">front page</a> was styled 
to look less like a blog, which will hopefully make fewer people think that
that is indeed the case.
</p>

<p>
Some new text was added to <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Pope/" rel="nofollow">the
    story "The Pope Died on Sunday"</a> (in Hebrew).
