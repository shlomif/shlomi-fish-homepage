Since the last update, the following changes took place:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
    <p>
    Three small-scale humorous creations of mine are now available on the site:
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/GPL-is-not-Compatible-with-Itself/">"The 
        GPL is not Compatible with Itself"</a> (formerly published on
    iglu.org.il), 
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/RMS-Lint/">"Introducing 
        RMS-Lint"</a> (also formerly published there), and the new
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Crackas-Paradise/">"Cracka's
        Paradise"</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
        A recent press conference of the Free Software Foundation confirmed the
        rumours that the GNU General Public License was found to be
        incompatible with itself. This newly discovered fact may actually cause
        a lot of disorder in the free software world in which most programs and
        libraries are licensed under this licence.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    New fortunes were added to the "shlomif", "shlomif-fav" and "subversion" 
    collections in the <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">Fortune
        Cookies Files</a>.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    New links were added to
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/">the various 
        Against-bad-software pages</a> and to 
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/links.html">the links page</a>.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    There were several underlying changes to the content managemeng system
    and build system of the site. In many pages, breadcrumbs' trails are
    now better and more encompassing, and more pages were added to the
    section navigation menus.
    </p>
    </li>
</ol>
