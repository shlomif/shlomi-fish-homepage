<h2>Can we do better than O(n*log(n))?</h2>

<points>
<li>
If we want to keep the states sorted - no.
</li>

<li>
If, however, we just want to determine if a given state is present
or not, then the answer is: "usually".

<h2>What is a hash?</h2>

<points>
<li>
As far as we are concerned a hash is an array of <b>buckets</b>. The index 
of the bucket into which a given state goes is determined according to a
deterministic hash function.
</li>

<li>
A hash function is highly magical and should make sure similar records 
have very distinct hash values, and all hash values are generated
in roughly equal frequency.
