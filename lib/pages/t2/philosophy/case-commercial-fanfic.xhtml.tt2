<p>
As unlikely as it sounds, I think I reached the "right" conclusions at <a
href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/my-real-person-fan-fiction/">my
previous attempt</a> while having a somewhat misled deduction chain.
</p>

<p id="geek_def">
As of March 2021, it seems most talented,
skillful, competent, and attractive individuals of any gender, age
and profession, and past experience are increasingly both geeks (= <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/paul-graham.html">"amateurs"</a>; love what
they do; not doing it only for money, even though they may be offered
a lot) and <a href="#what_is_hacking">great hackers</a> (= "action heroes"; bending or challenging the "rules",
not accepting their fate, being resourceful, thinking outside the box, etc.).
or even "hacker monarchs" / "messiahs".
As I show, this implies most new quality screenplays and
stories are currently and are going to increasingly not only be fanfiction but
also crossovers, parodies, and/or real person fiction - usually including
recent [% proprietary %] franchises and recent (and often living)
real people.  And they aren't being written in the finicky, hard to get right,
and boring <a href="#hollywood_screenplay_format">Hollywood-blessed screenplay format</a>,
and geeks will increasingly stop sending drafts or proposals to
<a href="#be_communicative">non-communicative</a> reviewers.
</p>

<p>
One thing I got wrong is thinking a geek will refuse to get paid. Perhaps it
was true for amateurs and geeks before the advent of Capitalism, but is no
longer true now.  That is wrong, as of 2021, because often, geeks are now
offered large amounts of money or at least token
pay.  For example, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>, who is
a software developer, an action hero, a geek, and <a
href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">a remarkable amateur
philosopher and entertainer</a>, is believed to get paid 20 million USD/year.
While he will gladly continue to comaintain the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux kernel project</a>
for less, it is commonly accepted that it is a reasonable salary to give him.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, attractive actors (including female actresses and/or inexperienced
and obscure ones and/or formerly big name ones) are also geeky hackers. As a
result, they will not play in any badly written film (and usually a dystopian,
ending badly, pessimistic, politically correct and dishonest one) even for all
the money in the world.
</p>

<p>
Geeks are not to be confused with "dorks" who are (for the context of this
essay) people without social life, or who seem reckless, not confident,
unattractive, etc.  Moreover, "amateur" now has pejorative meaning of something
done poorly or non-skillfully but in the 19th century, it was a compliment.
</p>

<p>
The word "nerd" can mean either "geek" or "dork".
</p>

<p>
These were contrasted
to "professionalism" (= doing something only for money, regardless of how little or a lot:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJrqpR_7VSo">"We're not just doing it
for money!…We're doing it for a shitload of money"</a>;
not enjoying your work).
</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJrqpR_7VSo" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<p>
A geek may agree to do some tasks that are not too enjoyable as part of their
job.  There is also the old <a
href="https://shlomifish.livejournal.com/1747.html">Stoic method</a> of trying
not to hate a task and even allowing oneself to enjoy it. This is reflected in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftxnr28LDXc">the "spoonful of sugar
makes the medicine go down" scene</a> from Disney's <i>Mary Poppins</i>.
However, if the job is destructive and pointless, e.g one that stands against
the contemporary <a href="#open_free_share_steal">"open / free / share"</a>
ideals, then it can never be enjoyable.

people expect you to do, following <a

<p>
"Craziness" / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevi%27im">Nev'ua</a> (
which was mistranslated as "prophecy").  I suspect "lenabé" in Biblical times
originally meant to "act crazy", to "drive crazy", "to be crazy", "to seek
[divine] guidance", including in today's casual senses.  It involved:
"funny"ness, exaggeration, song-and-poetry, emulation, contradicting one self,
<a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Luna_Eclipsed">intimidation and fear
(which can be fun in a way)</a> - even blasphemy.
Many [% MOTAS %] nevertheless found it sexy.
</p>

<p>
Plato considered insanity as divine, and during his time, the good "stand-up
philosophers" or nevi'im (and many similar phenomena in the Near East), were
often funny, or otherwise exciting, exalting, non "original" (borrowed and
built upon the works of their peers and predecessors), often seemingly
or actually contradicted
themselves, blasphemous or just seemingly "stupid", and didn't take themselves
seriously. Although held with <a
href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/image-macros/#pbride_philosophers">some
contempt</a>, they were highly coveted by [% MOTAS %].
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology)">Julian Jaynes</a>
hypothesised that the Nevi'im were <a

hallucinated voices of "gods" (= <a

and who spoke in poems or rhymes.  However, now I think most of the later ones
were only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania">hypomanic</a> (=
mild-mania) at worst, often spoke in prose or in free form verse, and often not
only emulated, built-upon, parodied, or mocked their predecessors or
contemporaries, but topped them.
</p>

<p>
And they were often accused of being <a

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes">"There

<p>
Just for the record, while I am enamoured with many YouTube cover
artists, and whose songs comprise of most of the music I listen to,
my sister, who is 5 years my junior and who has a Ph.D. in Computer
Science (so she is intelligent and techsavvy), has a prejudice
against them.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The Biblical
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson">Samson</a> was <strong>not</strong>
in general
an action hero, but a classical "I'm
taking them all with me" / <a
href="https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0716.htm#28">"may my soul perish with
philistines"</a> tragic hero, who worked hard (and not smart!) and took
many lives of (often innocent) people who cared about him.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Naturally, when software developers say "I hacked a Python script" or
"The Linux kernel is a great hack" they mean that they were created or
concieved with pleasure. The Ancient Hebrew verb <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%93%D7%A2">ידע ("yada`", "lada`at")</a>
meant both "to know"
and to "have had sex with". However, I hypothesised that it also
meant "to create something with joy" and a linguist friend confirmed that. A female software developer who
paid me to teach her <a href="https://perl-begin.org/">the
Perl programming language</a> told me that writing a Perl script
felt like giving birth for her.
</p>

<p>
As a result, I think "yada`" had some of the contemporary meaning of "hacking"
despite some etymological erosion.
</p>

<p>
This corresponds with the <a
href="#hacking_and_amateur__vs__conformism_and_professional">"amateur" /
"geeky" nature</a> of workers loving/enjoying their work.
</p>

<p>
Also note that hacking sometimes <b>does</b>
involve a prolonged and intense amount of work
as opposed to the <a href="#david_and_goliath">David vs. Goliath
's "taking the easy way out"</a>. David for example
had likely spent many hours practicing his slingshot skills
and honing them.
</p>

<p>
That put aside,
despite common belief, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-nasa-spen/">NASA

<p>
Traditionally (as of 2021), there was an apparent
dichotomy between geek and hacker culture and "mainstream"
culture. Geeks were considered intelligent, but unattractive,
shy, anti-social, unathletic, and often without "real-life" social life.
My 2005 [% hhfg %] story
presented male and female open source and [% opencontent %] geeks and hackers
as competent, confident, sexually attractive, socially capable, assertive, as well as
popular and coveted. It was written as an antithesis to Paul Graham's <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html">"Why Nerds are Unpopular" essay</a>
and the <a
href="https://www.shlomifish.org/me/resumes/Shlomi-Fish-Resume-as-Writer-Entertainer.html">Buffyesque false
social dichotomy</a>. Some commentators claimed it was detrimental, because the
target demographic for "open source"/etc. geeks was the social outcasts,
"uncool" kids.
</p>

<p>
However, by the time the first season of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory">The Big Bang
Theory</a> aired during late 2007, it was an established observation that geeks
and hackers were the Alphas.  Moreover, I believe that its primary "anti-Geek"
character, <a href="https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Penny">Penny</a>,
despite her "hot dumb blonde girl" image, and her ignorance and laymanship, was
a superb hacker and geek. This is because she constantly challenged and broke
the hidden rules of the show's more stigmatic (and less attractive looking)
geeks, and because she was passionate and enthusiastic about many of her
endeavours.  Moreover, she is often depicted as trying to emulate the
nerdier/dorkier geeks, and successfully.

Hollywood's blessed screenplay format is boring, finicky, and requires a lot of
time to prepare and get right.
</p>

[% IF 0 %]
It only has one proprietary Windows-only program
and one unmaintained, slow, and non-responsive, open source program - <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtx">Celtx</a>, that can be used to edit
it.
[% END %]

<p>
Moreover, it is poorly documented, cannot be <a href="https://github.com/caramelomartins/awesome-linters">validated and linted</a> by an automated program,
and <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/unwebbable/">has issues
being XML and HTML-friendly</a>
</p>

<p>
As a hacker/action hero I'd rather <a href="[% base_path
%]humour/stories/">my screenplays</a> never be filmed by Hollywood studios,
than waste time preparing one in its blessed format. Furthermore,
since it cannot be automatically <a
href="https://github.com/caramelomartins/awesome-linters">linted or
validated</a>, one often needs to revise or
amend the drafts, which is even more time-consuming. Rinse and repeat.
</p>

<p>
One can imagine most young
or young-at-heart screen writers who use code sharing sites
and services (e.g: [% GitHub %] or GitLab), wikis, desktop or online word
processors, or similar tools, will also sport the same sentiments.
</p>

<p id="hacker-laziness">
As <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">Paul Graham notes</a> in a
different context: <q>Hackers are lazy, in the same way that mathematicians and
modernist architects are lazy: they hate anything extraneous.</q>
</p>

<p>
So a lack of "original" screenplays and many unemployed screenplay readers is
not surprising.
</p>

<p>
Note that even if a screenwriter has prepared such Hollywood-blessed
screenplays in the past, he or she likely met enough fans, critics (either
positive or <a
href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/">negative</a>

a custom format. Perhaps any self-contained XHTML5/HTML5 page or <a

ones on the public-facing web.
</p>

<p>
One can find many screenplays like that in
<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/"><b>Archive of our own</b></a>,
but there are likely many more.
</p>

<p>
Given many screenplays are reworked, or even improvised upon
during filming, their formatting should not be too draconian and
finicky, anyway.

<p>
I am quite happy with my
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/XML-Grammar/Fiction/">XML-Grammar-Fiction</a>'s

and I added more features to these grammars as I needed them ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI - "You aren't going to need it"</a> ). Nevertheless, I'd be happy with other grammars that can be validated and linted.
</p>

<p>
It is also conceivable to write converters from subsets of
other trendy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language">lightweight markup languages</a> (e.g : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc">AsciiDoc</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#CommonMark">CommonMark</a> ) and other document formats such as Google Docs or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OpenDocument</a>, to these grammars.

If you do not like a work, please try to comment on why you think it is
lacking, rather than completely dismissing it or vaguely criticising it ( e.g:
"it sucks"; "you cannot write"; "it's a waste of space"; "try to write it as if
you were there").  People are often amazed by food reviewers in the recently
trendy <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television#Reality_competition/game_shows">cooking
competition ("reality") shows</a> being very pedantic and pinpointing small and
large problems, but it comes with experience and "with the territory". So I
applaud these reviewers.
</p>

<p>
Telling a contributor why you dislike their work will make reworked and future
works better, and your own future job easier. Reportedly, film studios often
silently dismissed screenplays that they received. I recently submitted my <a

it is often indicative that the <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/02/19/seven-steps-to-remarkable-customer-service/">problem needs to be fixed more permanently</a>.
I also recall being given a list of reasons by a web ad service for why my

<p>
Now for a personal story: back when I was in the 7th or the 8th grades (I am
1977-born, so it was around <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War">the first Gulf War</a>; ~1990),
my classroom studied a Hebrew translation of Molière's play <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Misanthrope">The Misanthrope</a> as
part of our "Literature" studies and my classmates took turns reading the
lines. One day I was assigned to read the lines of the titular character, and
whereas most of my peers read their lines without excitement, I was
enthusiastically envigorating the role with much fake emotion. I became a hit
and almost monopolised that role.
</p>

<p>
One reason I did that was that at the time, I was more oriented toward
Maths and other exact sciences, and because in Israel, one's 7th/8th grade
Literature grades have little effect on their scholastic aptitude. So
I had little to lose.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I recall playing the close-to-the-finish monologue where I was
lamenting the disappearance of my character's treasure box. I felt I acted
unnaturally, but it was still fun, and my classmates gave me an enthusiastic
ovation.
</p>

<p>
My performances there are lost in the proverbial <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_records">Akashic records</a>
because they were not recorded. Furthermore, for better or for worse, I was a
web worker and writer, during the early days of [% the_web %], an amateur graphics
manipulator, and a professional software developer (who also has done <a

mashes together the real world <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a>, her franchise's characters: Harry

<p>
While it also sports a parody of the fable <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_miller%2C_his_son_and_the_donkey">"The
miller, his son and the donkey"</a>, the donkey there is the <a
href="https://shrek.fandom.com/wiki/Donkey">one from the Shrek franchise</a> as
originally voiced by Eddie Murphy, and he ends up being transformed
into a bigger and stronger stallion, like in the second Shrek film.
</p>

<p>
These are all building blocks of my creative spiritual world.  Any screenwriter
who can successfully mutate the screenplay (and they have my blessing and legal
permission to do so) must use recent enough characters and quotes.  To quote <a
href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Groucho_Marx">Groucho Marx</a>: <q> I don’t
care to belong to any club that will have me as a member</q>. The Muppets
franchise did such crossovers and [% RPF %] since the 1970s (e.g. <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNYI3iINXrQ">"Sam the Eagle versus Alice

amazingly fresh and funny even today.

As much I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin">Charlie

Glau &amp; Chuck Norris as Grammar Nazis"</a> fanfic episode, despite the fact
that he also was Hollywood's "alpha male" at the time.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I believe most hobbyist screenwriters either approve of other people
taking their works in their own direction ( <a
href="http://ccmixter.org/files/zep_hurme/38531">"If they don't like it, tell
them they can go and remake it"</a>. ), or lack the time and energy (even if
they have enough money) to start a long litigation process.
</p>

<p>
Good hackers are constructively lazy, and <a
href="#open_free_share_steal">build
on the work of others</a>. And this means doing crossovers, parodies, and real
person fiction. </p>

<p>
As an analogy, most software developers will use high-level programming
languages, and convenient desktop or mobile operating systems to write <a
href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/05/06/five-worlds/">what Joel on
Software calls</a> "throwaway code", or "in-house code" or even a lot of
shrinkwrap (open source/proprietary/etc.) codebases whose performances are not
too critical, as well as libraries, APIs, and development tools.  Writing
everything in assembly (or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit">ASIC</a>
if you're really crazy and rich) will be a grand waste of time, and usually
development effort will exceed the runtime of code written using higher level
languages. <q>Real programmers use a nice [text] editor and a programming
language and get done in less than O(N!)</q> ( <a
href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-sharp-programming-real-programmers">vanguard
on ##programming</a>).
</p>

<p>
Similarly, most competent screenwriters will use characters, concepts, and
texts from more than one recent franchises or works for most largescale
screenplays.  They will either get frustrated at their "lack of imagination" or
accept that the screenplay will have to be anonymised. I'm proud of me being a
fanfic writer / remixer, and suspect the situation will only get "worse"
for the commercial film and fiction industries.
</p>

<p>
Do note that, like parents, I believe geeky and hackery screenwriters are very
proud of their intellectual children (at least when they are happy or
hypomanic), and won't mutate them on their own volition without a good reason.
They will refuse to de-fanfic them, even if it means that they'll find
different jobs (where their hacker and geek nature is being approved of and
respected, including lower-paying ones), or become <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Con_Man_(web_series)">Con-Men</a> (=
creators who frequent conventions/conferences, and making an income out of it),
or like me publish and publicise their "fics" on the web and social media
outlets. I suspect the reason several promising T.V. shows (e.g:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)"><i>Firefly</i></a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator:_The_Sarah_Connor_Chronicles"><i>Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</i></a>,
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Shakers"><i>Game Shakers</i></a>)
got cancelled recently, is that their screenwriters turned "to the dark side"
so to speak and started using fanfic - elements there, which would be
a legal and pseudo-ethical minefield.
</p>

<p>
It seems the parodical 2001 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Another_Teen_Movie"><i>Not Another Teen Movie</i></a>
killed the whole genre. However, I've written the afforementioned
[% hhfg %] story in 2005 (after recovering from my
<a href="#learning_more_from_inet_forums">Technion "education", or
relative lack of it and entertainment</a>), and it is a geek/hacker spin
on the teen story model. It too is partly crossover/RPF fanfic, but despite
that two teenagers living in the USA (where it takes place) asked me if it was
real.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, its two female protagonists seemed quite farfetchedly competent back
then, but I'd bet many younger girls (or older ones that have the right
attitude) today can easily blow them out of the water.

Even though I tried to find truly malevolent people per <a
href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/guide-to-neo-tech/">Neo-Tech</a> and some possible
interpretations of my Israeli-taught mostly-Tanakh Judaism, I was unable to run into a
truly evil person. Even historical mass-murderers (e.g: Stalin, Mao, Hitler,
Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun, Alexander of Macedonia, even <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebuchadnezzar_II">Nebuchadnezzar</a>)
provided some redeeming actions or wisdom. See for instance <a
href="https://www.geekwire.com/2011/top-10-reasons-darth-vader-amazing-project-manager/">"Top
10 reasons why Darth Vader was an amazing project manager"</a> with an easy
(but tabooed) "Darth Vader"⇒"Nazi Germany's leadership" substitution.

Since I have at least subconsciously (and lately consciously) believed everyone
can improve and change, and grow (see the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect">Pygmalion effect</a> vs.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem_effect">the Golem effect</a>) and
treated them like that, they eventually usually did improve.
</p>

<p>
My mother told me once "There are no bad people - only bad actions".
Moreover, the iconic Israeli homeless man, "Ayalon Dude", (see <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtUJVg2nCzk">an interview with him in
Hebrew</a>) once proposed her to marry him, because she treated him with
respect and friendliness. She naturally refused because she was and still is
happily married (to my father).
</p>

<p>
As a result, I don't think that Hollywood producers, executives, lawyers,
directors, and other workers are evil (or alternatively USA/etc. government,
parliament, legal system, etc. workers are) - just possibly misguided.

intestate with a fortune estimated at £2 million, which became the subject of
legal wrangles (Jennens vs Jennens) in the Court of Chancery for well over a

One reason the [% RIAA %] member companies embraced YouTube and other media sharing
sites as distribution channels for their songs, was that there were enough
independent musicians who provided (sometimes not too inferior and often
superior) covers of the songs and didn't care too much about getting direct ad
revenue. It's not as if one gets penalised for getting a million views (or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_most-viewed_YouTube_videos&amp;oldid=1004942122">much
more</a>) rather than a mere one hundred. Furthermore, to <a

Tim O'Reilly</a> <q>The greatest threat to authors and creative artists is not
piracy — it’s obscurity.</q>.
</p>

<p>
The [% RIAA %] member companies are happy now providing legal or financial
services to signed artists and lately even actively promoting them and YouTuber
singers (and the line between signed and independent artists has been getting
more blurry).
</p>

<p>
As an analogy, The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church">Roman Catholic</a> church used to burn at stake girls who
admitted to having premarital sex even once. On the other hand, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna">Madonna</a>, who identifies as a
Catholic, and boasted of having had premarital sex with dozens of willing men,
( and I have no reason to doubt her) was not only left unharmed, but was welcome
in some of the holiest churches in Israel and the Palestinian Authority during
her visit there. If you ask a Catholic clergyman if she or similar "sin"ful
women should be killed again he'd likely say: <q>Dear Lord no! 'Thou shall not
kill'. It's up to God to punish them if he sees fit, but we should not act as
his agents.</q>. So the Roman Catholic church now is more benevolent
- by choice.
</p>

<p>
More recently, the <a
href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ceiling-cat">"Ceiling cat is watching you
masturbate"</a> captioned image, has stopped many preachers from using the
shopworn "omniscient, omnipresent, deity [who cares about your sex life]"
argument. However, to be frank, it was neither effective, nor desirable. I
think there are far better insights and memes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">the Hebrew Bible</a>, than that
(despite being a non-observant <a
href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/religious_belief.xhtml">agnostic</a>).
</p>

<p>
Similarly, the [% RIAA %] is not going back to the pre-YouTube / pre-"piracy"
days, because even if it could, it would rather not. We need to be more
creative and resourceful when reforming the
fiction/drama/Hollywood/film-industry world, but I think we should try, and we
likely can succeed.

The commercial fiction industry ( "Hollywood"/etc. ) is not a good oligopoly
because they assume people will only enjoy fanfic from one franchise or at most
two. This causes franchises to be territorialised even inside media

mashed together the franchises of previous generations, along with [% RPF

I can further suggest the owners of major (and minor) franchises to put them
under <a

copyright licences</a>, requesting that a donation be made in case there is
profit.  If one cannot legally accept donations, then they can sell digital

They can do it either by agreement or unilaterally.  As an analogy, I recall
that back in the late 1990s, there was an initial resistance by vendors of <a

SQL databases</a> to release official <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> ports of their databases (which
they built and supported on similar, but proprietary and costly, <a

However, then they announced their intentions to do so one by one, and
it was <a
href="https://linux.slashdot.org/story/98/08/01/0948200/we-just-typed-make">technologically
easy to do</a> and brought all of them many sales.
And today anyone who proposes deploying a Unix-like server that does not
run an open-source operating system (GNU/Linux or
BSD or similar)
except for running legacy applications ,<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-sharp-programming-mac-server">is in a state of sin</a>.

Copyright maximalism, and franchise territorialism, are artificial, man-made,
and unnecessary problems.  They can be subverted either legally, or in
practice, by hacking around them. As alternatives to the more famous actors,
cosplayers can play as them or one can produce lower-cost animations (including

I was probably too young to prevent the death of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith">Samantha Smith</a>, one of
the youngest known hacker monarchs up to her time.  I believe she died because
in her later career as a child actress, she didn't insist on doing things her
way, until she was killed by a private nighttime flight plane crash, which she
took due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris">hubris</a> and
impatience.
</p>

<p>
I am however saddened that I didn't prevent the premature death of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie">Christina Grimmie</a> at
age 22 in 2016, who was a singer, songwriter, and YouTube indie artist. I and
others expected her to dominate the music world, or perhaps the whole world at
large, for years to come (and become a <a

her, and who committed suicide shortly after shooting her. I believe her death
was also caused by her not doing things her way, which made her later work
gradually deteriorate, her sex-appeal (which <a

Well, I'm still going to try, and there may be obstacles, and setbacks,
and I might not succeed, but I won't give up for now.
I may still <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FCld2UJMRg">"walk away"

But I'll carry on for now.
</p>

<p>
And I'm not alone. There are many fan-fiction (or "original" fic) authors who
would love to see their ideas filmed, but know that submitting them to
Hollywood studios is futile. There are dozens if not hundreds of unemployable
formerly "big name" actors, actresses, film makers, and screenwriters.
There are many disgruntled lawyers who make <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/my-real-person-fan-fiction/#commercial_fanfic">atrocious "Intellectual Property" demands</a>
and even put one long paragraph of legalese on a McDonalds' Happy Meal toy.
And even the Hollywood executives likely feel trapped.

<p>
I have some "enemies" as well. My greatest enemy is naturally myself - how
I manage my time, how I say what I say, my prejudice and <a href="#guidelines_as_dogma">"rules"</a>
I succumb to, and my past record, legacy and mismanagement.
I also have to handle:
</p>

for months and are effectively unreachable.
</p>

</p>

or even court precedents and other <a href="#guidelines_as_dogma">guidelines</a>

They are not obstacles to be casually dismissed. But they may be
surmountable. Furthermore, I am not seeking to destroy the commercial
film industry this time, but to make them prosper. And I believe
commercial fanfiction will be nice to have, even if some film studios
go out of business (which I hope will not happen).

I created <a

captioned image</a> back in August 2014 which echoed my sentiments that female
fighters in films have become not-as-intimidating-as-they-could-be.  Taylor
Swift's delayed (and likely indirect) response, published in 18 May 2015 was
this videoclip for her song <a

Blood</a>:

One should note that the female entertainers in the clip marketed themselves as
singers and/or models, despite the fact that they were technically acting in
the clip.  If they were actresses, appearing in that clip would have
accelerated their "Hollywood unhirability" (but why should it have?)

I also wish to dedicate this essay to the cast and makers of [% BtVS %],
including <a href="#film_industry_losing_the_psychological_war">Joss Whedon</a>
and [% SMG %]. I consider Buffy to be the <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs">hacker monarch</a>
of the brief "Web 1.0" period, comparable to Saladin, The Muppets, Jules Verne
and The Beatles.
Unfortunately, the growing prevalence of the Internet and the web (and
the <a href="#open_free_share_steal">"open" / remix</a> culture) combined
with some unfortunate mismanagement decisions (Buffy not ending at high school
graduation, <a href="https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Faith_Lehane">Faith</a>
being placed in a coma, and the show stopping being aired in Israel
and possibly other countries) started spelling doom on it.
While Gellar was <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/biggest_celeb_crush.xhtml">my biggest celebrity crush</a>,
a role model,
and the "queen of the (1.0) Web", she was dethroned by Natalie Portman
soon after that, who in turn gave way to Jennifer Lopez,
Beyoncé Knowles, and Paris Hilton.
</p>

<p>
Like I note, I suspect the creativity crisis of the film industry is caused
by its operational and legal policies, and film makers like Whedon are
not immune to their psychological effects.
