Welcome to the <a href="http://linuxclub.il.eu.org/">Haifa Linux Club</a> 
lecture about Basic Use of Linux. This lecture will cover both using 
"X-Windows", the Linux windowing interface, with a lot of focus on its
KDE desktop environment. It will also cover using the Linux' command-line
interface, because some things in Linux can only be done or are better done
at the command-line.
