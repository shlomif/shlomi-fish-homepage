<latemp_subject "File-Dir-Dumper - Serialise Meta-Data of Directory Structures" />

<p>
This is a Perl CPAN distribution to dump the meta data (file sizes,
permissions, filenames, etc.) of a directory structure to a stream. It uses
a stream of <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>-dumped data structures,
as its representation.
