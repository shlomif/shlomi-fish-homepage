seriously.

I have now concentrated the tech tips from my blogs on
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/tech-tips/">one
page</a> on the site for easy lookup and searching.
</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>
We now mirror the humorous items
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/if-people-bought-cars-like-computers/">“What
if people bought cars like they bought computers?”</a>
and
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/what-if-drivers-were-hired-like-programmers/">“What

</li>

<li>
<p>
There are new <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/">Chuck Norris factoids</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The Klingon warriors’ motto is “It’s a good day to die.” Chuck Norris’s motto
is “It’s a good day to kill.”

<li>
<p>

</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The version control repository was moved to
<a href="https://github.com/shlomif/shlomi-fish-homepage">new
location on GitHub</a> and we run the build and tests using
a <a href="https://travis-ci.org/shlomif/shlomi-fish-homepage">Travis-CI
continuous integration service</a>. Part of the motivation for the switch
to GitHub was because the continuous integration services offered for Bitbucket
did not seem as comprehensive or easy as Travis-CI.

<p>
Hope you enjoy all that!
