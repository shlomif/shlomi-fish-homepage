The Book "The Mythical Man-Month" by Fred Brooks was written in 1974 and
a second edition was released in 1995, which included four new chapters.

The Book is considered a seminal work in the field of software engineering
and team management.

It is basically a long list of problems a software project may encounter
with solutions proposed for them. (some good, some partial)

<b>Brooks' Law:</b> adding more developers to a project increases the number
of interactions that have to exist between them, and so the output does
not increase linearily.

As ESR notes, Gerald Weiberg observed that in shops where developers were not
territorial about their code, and encouraged others to look for bugs and
correct them, output was drastically better.

<li>
That's why an open-source Bazaar-style project which is open for public
scrutiny can advance much faster than a completely closed Cathedral-style
project.
