Data Structures:
================

The RWLock will use a queue. Each element of the queue will contain:
1. a condition variable
2. a flag that indicates if it contains readers or writers pending.
3. num_threads - an integer specifiying how many threads are waiting on it.
4. was_first_thr_accepted - a flag that indicates if the first thread has
already been accepted from it. (used only for a writers' pack).

The RWLock will contain a counter that tells it how many readers are using
it at the moment (num_readers), and a flag that specifies if there's a
writer using the lock (is_writer). It also uses a common internal mutex
to protect against mutual exclusion (mymutex)

Algorithm:
==========

accept_pending_items:
---------------------

Peek the first element out of the queue.

If it is a writers' pack, it decrements the number of threads by one,
and signals the condition variable, and sets was_first_thr_accepted to 1.
Afterwards, if (elem.num_threads == 0) it extracts and destroys the item.

If it is a readers' pack, it broadcasts the condition variable. Then it
extracts and destroys the item.

get_write_access:
-----------------

locks mymutex.

Checks if is_writer is set or num_readers is greater than 0. If so,
it enqueues itself. (the mutex of the condition variable is mymutex)

If not it sets is_writer to 1.

    Enqueuing:

    peek the tail of the queue. If it is a writers' pack and
    its was_first_thr_accepted is false, increase the number of threads
    there by 1 and wait on its condition variable. If not, enqueue a new
    writer's pack with a threads_num set to 1 and a new condition variable.


Unlocks the mutex.


get_read_access:
----------------

locks mymutex.

If the queue is empty and is_writer is false it increments num_readers
and unlocks mutex.

Else it enqueues itself, while using mymutex for waiting on the
condition variable. When the condition variable is signalled,
num_readers is incremented by 1.

    Enqueueing:

    peek the tail of the queue. If it is a readers' pack,
    increase the number of threads there by 1 and wait on its
    condition variable. If not, add a new readers pack with threads_num
    set to 1 and a new condition variable, which it will wait upon.

Unlocks mutex.



release_write_access:
---------------------

locks mutex

Sets is_writer to false. Then calls accept_pending_items.

unlocks mutex

release_read_access:
--------------------

locks mutex

Decrements num_readers. If num_readers == 0 it calls accept_pending_items.

unlocks mutex
