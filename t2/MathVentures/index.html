This section of my homepage is dedicated to various math problems that I
encountered in real-life or thought about them myself <B>and</B> managed to
solve. I have a couple of others which I'm still pondering, and I may add a
page with their description some time later.<BR><BR>

This page is under construction. Some of the links may not point anywhere,
and some of the articles may be incomplete. They will be completed sooner or
later. Please mail your comments, suggestions and (hopefully not ;) )
