<p>
This is Freecell Solver - a program that automatically solves games of
Freecell and similar Solitaire variants such as Eight Off, Forecell and
Seahaven Towers, as well as Simple Simon boards. Freecell Solver is free
software distributed under the public domain. It is written in ANSI C
and requires a C compiler to be built. Nevertheless, binaries for
Windows 32-bit are available.
</p>
<p>
Included with the archive is source code for programs that can automatically
feed it with the boards of several popular Solitaire Implementations.
</p>
<p>
Freecell Solver can also be built as a library for use within your own
Solitaire implementations. A more detailed list of features can be found
in the <a href="features.html"><b>Features List</b></a>.

<h3>28-Sep-2002</h3>
<p>
Freecell Solver 2.8.0 has been released. This version features a better
documentation and help screens, a preset system, and an option to read
paramters from files. Plus, it is possible to run one instance of the
solver after the other in case the other one has returned a negative
verdict.
</p>
<p>
All in all: a lot of added usability!
</p>
<h3>12-Jul-2002</h3>
<p>
Freecell Solver 2.6.0 has been spotted in the wild. This version features
atomic moves, which are slower than the traditional ones, but guarantee
a true verdict. It also has a <tt>--prelude</tt> switch that allows running
a static order of quotas at start for the participating soft threads, and
makes constructing faster solving presets easier.
</p>
<p>
Several other flags were added, and the code has also been greatly optimized
and cleaned up, which makes Freecell Solver much faster than it was before.
