<!-- TITLE=New Aphorisms, Collections of Humorous “Facts” and Hebrew Translation of “Define Zionism”-->
<p>
There are <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#siginificance-of-being-18" rel="nofollow">four new aphorisms</a> in the aphorisms’ collection:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    A kid always wishes they were older until they are 18. Afterwards, they 
    always wish they were younger.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There’s <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/" rel="nofollow">a new
    sub-section of my humour section dedicated to collections of “facts”</a>
about various things that my friends or I originated. Right now,
there are some facts about Chuck Norris, why Knuth (= the famous computer
scientist) is not God, some facts about Larry Wall (the software developer
known for Perl) and some about how and why XSLT is evil. More additions are
welcome:
</p>

<blockquote>

    <ul>
        <li>
        Chuck Norris read the entire English Wikipedia in 24 hours. Twice. 
        </li>
        <li>
        Chuck Norris is the ghost author of the entire Debian GNU/Linux 
        distribution. And he wrote it in 24 hours, while taking snack breaks. 
        </li>
        <li>
        Bugs are too much afraid to reproduce on Chuck Norris’ computer. As a
        result, when he uses Microsoft Windows, it behaves just like a Linux
        system.
        </li>
    </ul>

<p>
There’s now an <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/art/#music" rel="nofollow">mp3 version
    of the “Yonathan Haqatan” MOD Techno/Dance version</a> (which my
friend and I prepared). Hopefully, it will be good enough to be heard by
people who are unable to play 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_file" rel="nofollow">module files</a>.
</p>

<p>
There’s now 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/politics/define-zionism/heb/" rel="nofollow">a 
    Hebrew translation of “Define ‘Zionism’!”</a> available.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/Spark/" rel="nofollow">the Spark
    page</a> was updated with many corrections, new links, and more
content:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
As opposed to Arc, which shipped with no automated tests, Spark will be
developed in a Test-driven development fashion. Namely, it will have a
comprehensive test suite that will need to fully pass upon any commit to the
trunk (or “master” or whatever the main branch is called).
</p>

<p>
The code of the tests is not expected to be authoritative for how the final
version of the language will behave. Rather, some future design decisions will
require changing the code of a lot of the tests accordingly.
</p>

<p>
I still don’t have a clear idea of how to design a lot of “big picture” Spark
design decisions. While I believe that design is good, I also think that Spark
should be designed incrementally, and that we can expect many design decisions
to change. Test-driven development, while accepting the fact that often a lot
of testing code will need to be modified, will allow us to do that.
</p>

<p>
I have added JavaScript-based text ads courtesy of 
<a href="http://www.adengage.com/" rel="nofollow">AdEngage</a> to the top of the page. My
hope is that they will provide me with some extra income for maintaining the
site, as a replacement to the Google AdSense ads that 
<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_hsite/11327.html">have 
    been suspended</a>. Being textual ads, they hopefully should note be
too intrusive, and I hope people can relate to my desire to be rewarded for
the hard work I put into the site and the costs of hosting it.
</p>

<p>
I have made several spelling, grammar, etc. corrections to some of my
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/" rel="nofollow">stories and 
    screenplays</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, I should note that I’ve heard several critiques of the new style,
which emphasised some problems with it. While it is more attractive than the
old one, it results in a narrow content section, especially where the
section navigation menu is present. I’m currently working on trying to
improve the new design or to replace it with a new one, so stay tuned.
