VPN is Virtual Private Network. It means having a number of computer
which are virtually on one network, while on the reality they are on
different networks in the internet.
</li>
<li>
Many ADSL and Cable
providers require their users to connect to them using a VPN.
</li>
<li>
In order to create a VPN, it is common to tunnel a whole network protocol 
stack, down to and including the data link layer, as an application layer 
(layer 7) connection.
</li>
<li>
Few common implementations of such VPN is <b>PPTP</b> (Point-to-Point
Tunneling Protocol), <b>L2TP</b> (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) and 
<b>PPPoE</b> (PPP
over Ethernet). 
</li>
<li>
Out of these, the Linux "back-end"
support for PPTP and PPPoE is good, while L2TP is still under
development.
