<p>
My main weblog of various odds and ends. I’m trying that it won’t be one of
these boring personal blog, but rather one that contains either philosophical
insights, or otherwise personal events that I think are of interest to the
public and provide some insights. It includes some political thoughts
of mine, which I hope are insightful.
</p>

<p>
I used to maintain this blog
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/shlomif/">on Advogato</a>,
and for some time cross-posted entries to both blogs, but no longer do. The
Advogato blog contains many older entries, though.
