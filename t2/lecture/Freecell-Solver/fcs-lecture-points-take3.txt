Description of the game:
------------------------

Freecell's Rules:
-----------------

* There are 8 stacks of cards, 4 freecells, and 4 foundations. The game
is played with one deck.

* At the beginning of play, the cards are dealt to the stacks (4*7+4*6).
The faces of all the cards are visible at the beginning of play.

* A freecell can hold one _single_ card.

* The foundations are built from ace to king and the object of the
game is to move all the cards to the foundations.

* A card can be placed on top of a card that is of the opposite colour,
and is higher in rank by 1, assuming that the latter is at the top of a
stack.

* An empty stack may be filled with any card.

* An atomic move consists of:
    - moving a card from a stack to a freecell.
    - moving a card from a freecell to a parent card on a stack.
    - moving a card from the top of a stack on top of a parent card on a
      different stack
    - moving a card from the top of a stack or from a freecell to the
      foundations.

    Strategies:
    -----------

    * A sequence of more than one card can be moved by moving the top cards to
      the freecells or to unoccupied stacks. The latter is commonly called a
      sequence move or a "supermove" if it involves temporarily putting some
      cards in a vacant stack.

    * Sometimes, it is useful to move cards to the freecells or temporarily
      to an empty column, so the card below them can serve as a basis for a
      sequence.


Pseudo-code for DFS:
-------------------

Solve-State(state, prev_states, ret)
    if (state == empty_state)
        Push(ret, state)
        return SOLVED
    for each move possible on state
        new_state <- apply(state, move)
        if (new_state in prev_states)
            ; Do nothing
        else
            add new_state to prev_states
            if (Solve-State(new_state, prev_states, ret) == SOLVED)
                Push(ret, state)
                return SOLVED
    return UNSOLVED

Freecell-Solver(init_state)
    if (Solve-State(init_state, Null, ret) == SOLVED)
        print "State was solved"
        while (state <- Pop(ret))
            print state
    else
        print "I could not solve this board";


State Collection:
-----------------

1. Initial Perl Version - A list of states - O(n) lookup
    - dirt slow.

2. In C - A sorted array + a sort margin that was qsorted into the array.
    - O(log(N) lookup and O(n^2*log(n)) (average) O(n^3) cumulative
    complexity.

3. Merging the sort margin instead of qsorting it in.
    - O(n^2) complexity cumulative complexity.
    - Noticeably Faster (times 3 or so)

4. A balanced binary tree - O(log(N)) lookup and O(N*log(N)) cumulative
    complexity.
    - Twice as fast or so.
    - I used predefined APIs in libavl, libredblack and glib. The glib
    one was relatively slower.

5. A Hash
    5.1 - Using Glib's Hash and a 4-byte wide XOR function as a hash function
        - dirt slow - even slower than an array.
    5.2 - Converting to MD5 as a hash function
        - Much better - roughly as much as a binary tree.
        - I ended up coding and tweaking my own hash implementation in the
            process. It turned out to be faster than glib's.
        - Your hash is only as good as your hash function!
    5.3 - MD5 is a cryptographically secure hash function. Its calculation is
        still very slow. Converting to Perl's hash function, which is faster.
    5.4 - Hash - a heuristic that gives _on average_ O(1) lookups and O(n)
        cumulative complexity. (worst case: O(n) lookups and O(n^2)
        cumulative)
    - TODO: Write about Hash optimizations (?)


Moves stuff:
------------

1. Meta-moves instead of atomic moves. I do several moves at once while
trying to achieve a certain "desirable" end in mind.
    - Examples: (see previous summary)

    * Put top stacks cards in the foundations.
    * Put Freecell cards in the foundations.
    * Put non-top stack cards in the foundations. (by moving cards above them
    to freecells or vacant stacks).
    * Move stack cards to different stacks.
    * Move sequences of cards onto free stacks.
    * Etc.


2. I generated a 1000 test boards and saw that some of them were reported
unsolvable. After I played one I discovered it was solvable, and realized
there was one generic type of meta-move that I missed (moving a card to a
parent on the same stack). So I implemented it and saw that the board could
now have been solved.

3. Someone reported some of the Microsoft boards to be unsolvable by FCS.
    - I realized some of my meta-moves were not generic enough so I
    generalized them.
    - Now, Freecell Solver can solve all of the Microsoft deals (except 11982
    which was reported to be unsolvable by any human or computerized solver).

4. Tom Holroyd reported a few "Seahaven Towers" boards which he generated
to be unsolvable. Again, it inspired me to improve the solver to accommodate
for solving them.

4. Adrian Ettlinger, however, made a thorough "benchmarking" of Freecell Solver
to test each solvability, and found several boards that could not be solved
with a certain number of Freecells.
    - This is a known issue, that I do not plan to take care of due to the
    definition of the FCS strategy.
    - I found out by tracing a solution to these boards (using Tom Holroyd's
    patsolve) that FCS did two moves in a certain way and not in another
    permutation of them. This caused it to be reported as unsolved
    eventually.

Scanning:
---------

* Specifying the order of the tests (possibly a subset of it) in
the command-line.
    - Sometimes allow solving boards very quickly.

* Best-First Search is a scan that uses a priority queue to determine
to which node in the graph to go next.

* Soft-DFS -
    - PySol game #980662 recursed into a depth of over 3000. On NT, this
    caused a stack overflow which resulted in an ugly segfault.
    - I decided to implement Soft-DFS which does not utilize procedural
    recursion but rather its own dedicated state stack.
    - This turned out to have an O(1) suspend and resume time instead
    of O(d) for hard-DFS.
    - (I later on discovered that a Win32 program can be compiled with more
    stack space, but decided to continue developing Soft-DFS just for the
    heck of it and to have a O(1) function depth).

* Optimization Scan -
    - Stephan Kulow (of KDE fame) complained that after he integrated FCS
    into patsolve, he had several games in which the stacks were moved
    back and forth all over the place. This is the property of DFS which
    is not guaranteed to eliminate redundant move.
    - I suggested to use a BrFS scan restricted to the states that were
    found in the solution path to try to eliminate redundant moves.
    - This turned out to be quite beneficial in most cases.

    - I later on implemented a scheme in which each state stored a pointer
    to its "parent" state (the state from which it was initially derived),
    and used back-tracking to trace the solution down there.
    - This turned out to have much the same effect as the optimization scan,
    but the optimization sometimes improved it a bit.

State Representation:
---------------------

* Chars and half-chars instead of longs and shorts.
    - Less memory = less swapping.
    - Operation on chars are just as fast as operations on dwords.
    - Refer to the Linux-IL thread

* Indirect Stack States
    - Collect the stacks in a collection, and keep one copy of each stack.
    - In every state, every stack would be stored as a pointer to the copy
    in the collection.

* Remembering the original location
    - Keep the indices of the stacks or freecells outside the main
      data-structure and sort the two arrays together.
    - The collection considers only the first sizeof(internal) bytes
    when comparing two states.
    - I later used this external information place to store other
    information like depth in the search tree, the parent state, etc.

Board Auto-Generators:
----------------------

* A short time after the release of Freecell Solver 0.2.0, Eric Warmenhoven
sent me a program he prepared to generate the initial boards of GNOME Freecell
so they can later be input into Freecell Solver.

* I thanked him for his effort and later continued the theme, by writing
programs to generate the board layouts of GNOME AisleRiot, PySol, and the
Microsoft Freecell/Freecell Pro deals (the latter are considered the standard
among hard-core Freecell enthusiasts).

* Some programs have integrated the Freecell Solver library, to allow for
automatically solving a board starting at a position that the player has
reached.

* Why not C++:
--------------

Markus Oberhumer (of PySol fame) asked me if I thought about converting my
solver to C++. (I suppose he meant with STL and all). Here is a full
answer why I'm not going to do it:

1. The solver is already working in ANSI C.

2. The code is not overly OO. Whatever OO concepts exist there, fit well
enough within what ANSI C gives me.

3. C++/STL may make it slower, perhaps even considerably. I'd rather not spend
time risking something like that, only to roll it back later.

4. ANSI C compiles much faster. (at least with gcc)

5. ANSI C is cleaner, more portable, and causes less unexpected problems
than C++.

I'm more willing to integrate C++-derived features there into the ANSI C code.
Things like namespaces, (non-inherited) classes, or inline functions.
However, for the time being I'd like to maintain the code as pure ANSI C.
Then again, some of the gcc extensions can prove very useful too, but I cannot
use them either.

The fc-solve-discuss flame-war:
-------------------------------

* Recent versions of Freecell Solver pass the moves from the initial
position to the final solution to the layer above.

* The stack -> stack moves are being outputted with the number of
cards that are moved.

* Freecell Pro, OTOH, used to ignore the number of cards and expected such
moves to comply with what the original Microsoft Freecell would do in that
case.

* This caused problems in playback of a large percentage of the games in
its integration with Freecell solver.

* A post I made to the mailing list about it
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/197) sparked a
very big flame-war that diverted to cover other topics.

* I actually was happy that there was some action there:
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/219)

* Usually the only thing that happens is that I announce new releases or ask
them questions and no-one or few people reply.

* Eventually Adrian Ettlinger (a FC-Pro hacker) have extended Freecell Pro
to make use of an optional number of cards to move argument. This made
playback of Freecell Solver solutions perfectly smooth.

The Story of the User API:
--------------------------

* Starting of Freecell Solver 1.0.0, FCS had a set of functions
entitled freecell_solver_user_ (after their prefix) meant for integration into
an existing software.

* When Stephan Kulow integrated them into kpat (a solitaire suite for KDE),
he did not use it, because it did not gave him everything he needed. Instead
he used the more basic internal functions.

* I told him that "I would sleep better at night" knowing that fcs_user_ will
be used, and asked him to implement the missing parts himself, and send me
the patch. He did.

* Markus Oberhumer (of PySol fame), created a Python interface for the
library, and again sent me some functions he wrote.

* Eventually, I converted the executable itself to use fcs_user (while adding
a lot of functions in the process) to make sure I give the embedding
application all the functionality that I use.

* I also ended up creating an API to analyse a command line and configure
a solver instance accordingly. This made writing programs that behave
in a similar manner to the fc-solve executable so much easier.

* I found it encouraging that <FILL IN>, an engineer who worked on Freecell
3D, was able to integrate fcs_user_ without my help, and just
informed me of the release of F3D.

Auto-confiscation and Friends:
-------------------------------

* Once upon a time Freecell Solver was distributed only with a makefile
for GNU make, and everyone were happy.

* When Stephan Kulow embedded its code into kpat, he adapted the makefile
to use the standard KDE autoconf-based build process.

* Somewhat afterwards, I decided that I want the build process to be more
portable and modular, and to give me the ability to build a shared library.

* The solution - Converting to Autoconf, Automake and Libtool.

* How to do that is out of the scope of this article. I can just say it is
not very straightforward, and required me a lot of tweaking and trial and
error.

* Then I decided building an RPM out of it would be nice. So I created an
RPM spec for it.

* Again, it required quite a lot of tweaking and experimenting. (Tzafrir's
Lecture (URL) and web-resource greatly helped).

* I eventually integrated generating an up-to-date RPM SPEC into the Autoconf
process, and thus, was able to build an RPM by issuing:

./configure
make dist
rpm -tb freecell-solver-*.tar.gz

from the distro. (link to what Joel Spolsky says about building a package in
one command).

* A corresponding Debian package has been initially created by Yotam Rubin and
is now maintained by Risko Gergely, who also uploads it to the Debian pool of
packages.


The Freshmeat Effect (and how to avoid it)
------------------------------------------

* When I created the first version of FCS, and gave it the final touches,
I decided to call it "Freecell Solver" in order for it to have a descriptive
title.

* I posted announcements for the first release and subsequent (usually stable)
releases on Freshmeat, and so made many people aware of it.

* Starting at the very first days, a Google search for "freecell solver"
yielded its homepage as the first link.

* Today, the situation is much worse: now most of the Google hits have
something to do with it.

* The query "freecell solver" is generic enough that someone may wish
to find any of the available Freecell Solvers.

* Solution: do your best to give an original name for your program, so it
won't clog up searches. Abbreviations, or acronyms or puns or just something
meaningless which you like, work best.
