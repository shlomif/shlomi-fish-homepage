<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>
This is Maniac Downloader, a maniac download accelerator. It is currently very
incomplete (see the TODO.txt file), but is still somewhat usable. Maniac
Downloader is being written out of necessity out of proving to improve the
download speed of files here (which I suspect is caused by a misconfiguration
of my ISP's networking), and as a result, may prove of use elsewhere.
</p>

<h3 id="secret-sauce">The Secret Sauce</h3>

<p>
The main improvement of Maniac Downloader over other downloader managers is
that if a segment of the downloaded file finishes, then it splits the largest
remaining segment, and starts another new download, so the slowest downloads
won't delay the completion time by much.
