A Jewish Deduction

The Bible dictates that "Thou shalt not seethe [= cook] a kid [= young goat]
in his mother's milk." To avoid any possibility of breaking that regulation, 
the Jewish tradition ruled that it also applies to female goats, to mature
goats, and to the meat and milk of two completely unrelated goats. It is 
also forbidden to eat the meat with fresh milk, and it applies to beef 
and mutten as well (including mixing the milk and meat of two different
beasts). Finally, chicken, which are incapable of milk production, may not
be eaten along with any mammal's milk either. 

We are fortunate that most mathematicians were not Jewish. Otherwise, it
would have been forbidden to divide by all numbers between -1 and 1.

Suggested Improvements to the Documentation:

The WYSIWYT project was for a long time fascinated by Microsoft's tremendous 
desire to advance its Internet Explorer web-browser. We saw the fact that 
they switched the help systems of the upcoming Windows 98, as well as 
Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0, to HTML a major step in advancing our project.

As a complementary step, some of the chief heads of our project suggested
that the Windows' manuals themselves, as well as all of Microsoft's ads,
will be designed in HTML and printed after being rendered by IE4. While this
project is in the preliminary and planning stages, we expect it to acquire a
large momentum soon.

2. Richard M. Stallman - a hippy. How girly is that?

4. Larry Wall - a cross between Linus and RMS (i.e: a hippy dweeb) that is 
even more girly.

Are you kidding?

CVS is not advanced as:

1. Microsoft Visual SourceSafe - the only sane choice for good data integrity 
and portability.

2. tarballs/zip-files and patches. This one excels in convenience, and 
robustness.

CVS is a very advanced version control system, however. I do wish that 
Subversion (which is a VCS that I have to use against my will) was as good as 
it is.

  <Mahmoud>  rindolf, writing a CMS from scratch with perl.. really
             cool, making my own template engine
  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: why???
  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: use TT2.
  <rindolf>  Or whatever.
  <Mahmoud>  rindolf, i dislike other CMS engines.. they are bloated and
             i don't trust them
  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: TT2 is pure perl.

  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: a CMS doesn't stay simple forever.
  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: and a CMS != Templating system.
  <Mahmoud>  rindolf, the template engine is quite simple, it's similar
             to how SimpleMachines forum does its templates
  <Mahmoud>  rindolf, just an external file with print 'foo'; commands
 <amnesiac>  Mahmoud, TT2 is very powerful
 <amnesiac>  Mahmoud, there are more templating systems, why not use any
             ofo the existing ones?

A few weeks ago, I've been to Freenode's #perl, talking to merlyn and other
guys, when we got to discuss the Biblical "Tower of Babel Myth". As it turned
out, the commonly perceived interpretation was not the one most scholars find
as more sensible, which is the one we ended up being taught at Junior High
School. 

What most people think is something like that: 

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The people spoke to each other in the same language, concentrated in one place,
and decided to build a tower high enough so they can reach God. God, a small
dwarf who lived in the sky, was afraid of the efforts of these people, because
he feared they'll reach him. So he casted an 8th level Spell of Language
Fragmentation, caused these people to speak in different tongues, and without
being able to understand each other, they ended up spreading across the Earth.
God was relieved and returned to his dwarfish deeds, as dwarfs do.

   <adeht>  <adeht> s/had/has/;
 <rindolf>  adeht: it's actually from sed and ed before that.
   <adeht>  I know, but I'm using perl syntax :)
 <rindolf>  adeht: now write it in Lisp.
   <adeht>  heh.
   <adeht>  in Lisp you wouldn't use a regex for this kind of dumb
            substitution.. though you could
   <adeht>  rindolf: a nice way of writing CL code is to imagine your
            dream language for expressing that particular problem, and
            then realizing it :)
 <rindolf>  You probably wouldn't use a regex in Python either.
 <rindolf>  adeht: I see.

No. 1 is true, naturally. No. 2 is not true - I know LISP but I prefer Perl. 
Other like Python, etc. The reasons I don't prefer LISP are:

1. The standards of Common LISP and Scheme don't define anything practical.
2. LISP is at the moment incredibly verbose.
3. As Larry Wall noted, all LISP code comes in parenthesis and so it all looks 
the same. (Perl is the exact opposite in this regard).
4. I cannot make heads nor tails of serious LISP code. Many LISPers create so 
many macros and use them along with regular LISP code, so you keep having to 
refer to the previous definitions, and make a lot of research to get you 
started.

SICP Scheme is easy and fun. But serious LISP code can take too much time to 
understand. OTOH, recently I had little problem reading the source code of 
other Perl programmers, and extending it or fixing bugs. (likewise for 
Python).

* One Thunderbird recommendation.
* Two Evolution recommendations.
* One Sylpheed Claws recommendation.
* One GMail recommendation.

The problem is that I wasn't interested to learn about alternative E-mail
clients, and just wanted to get my problem solved. And in GMail's case it was
completely out of the question due to my work's constraints.

RTFM vs. JATFM 
--------------

I recently had to figure out how to do something with wget: get everything
below a directory on the web-server, without following links to outside it. So
I logged in to FreeNode's #debian channel, where there are many knowledgable
people to ask it. The first answer I got was "RTFM". So, I read the wget man
page, but could not find it there. Eventually, after telling people that it
would be faster to give an answer, I got a reply ( add the -np -r flags). But
this has been the last straw. 

I composed my own acronym. Just like RTFM is "Read the Fabulous Manual" and
STFW is "Search the Fabulous Web", then JATFM is "Just Answer the Fabulous
Man". It means that it's usually faster to answer someone's question than to
ask him to RTFM, which is just going to annoy him. I think the RTFM mantra has
done a lot of damage in the UNIX/Linux world, and I hope JATFMing would prove
to be a more healthy ideology.

            quickly.
 <rindolf>  rbastic: under 5 or 10 minutes on a P4-2.4GHz with 1 GB of
            RAM.
 <rindolf>  rbastic: maybe KDE is making g++ look bad.
 <rbastic>  rindolf: yeah, i'm not a big KDE fan
 <rindolf>  rbastic: actually I'm using KDE-3.5.8 here.
 <rindolf>  rbastic: I was talking about the compilation speed of KDE
            apps and KDE itself.
 <rindolf>  rbastic: possibly because each file has half-a-gazillion
            headers.
 <rindolf>  My C++ code is a server one, so we don't have too many deps.
 <rbastic>  yeah, isn't there a way to cache header files? ie. in their
            "compiled" form?
 <rbastic>  or is that something I'm remembering from some other
            programming language that purported to build on top of C?
 <rindolf>  rbastic: MSVC has that.
 <rbastic>  ahh, nods
 <rindolf>  rbastic: no, Visual C++ has precompiled headers.
 <rindolf>  rbastic: I remember that I kept deleting them.
 <rbastic>  yeah, couldn't remember
 <rbastic>  lol
 <rindolf>  Pascal compiles very quickly.
 <rindolf>  That's one of the things I enjoyed in Delphi.
 <rbastic>  ugh, the app i'm been maintaining in Java was originally a
            fat client/server desktop app, written in Delphi
 <rindolf>  rbastic: ah.
 <rbastic>  i remember booting up the old app for the first time, and
            being amazed at how slow it was
 <rbastic>  eventually, i had to duplicate a feature in the Java code
            and i wasn't sure how it was implemented before
 <rindolf>  rbastic: you mean the Java app is faster? :S
 <rbastic>  so being as i had no Delphi experience, and the newer Delphi
            environments made NO sense to me at all, i just opened up
            the SQL Server query analyzer
 <rbastic>  rindolf: yes, but only b/c the Delphi programmer was an
            idiot, issuing queries over and over again needlessly
 <rbastic>  rindolf: if you could've seen the MSSQL Performance Analyzer
            or whatever, it was basically just.. Query1, Query2, Query3,
            Query1, Query2, Query3, repeat.

I don't suppose we should propose that as an alternative to Perl Gods, there 
should at least be Perl Saints:

http://www.stallman.org/saint.html

Of course, I'm not sure what being a Perl saint would imply. Using nothing but 
Perl? (Including not C in which perl 5 is written?)

Oh well.

Not that I mind the Perl Gods stereotype stuff.

        Shlomi Fish (a Perl saint^W hero wannabe, but definitely 
        not a Perl God)

I almost feel honor bound now to start a noise band called The Randal
Schwartz Condition.  I could shout his rants into a microphone while
the rest of the band flogged a newbie live on stage.
