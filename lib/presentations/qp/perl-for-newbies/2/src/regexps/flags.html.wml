<p>
There are other flags besides <tt>e</tt> that can be appended to the end
of the match or substitution.
</p>

<p>
An <tt>i</tt> following the regular expression call, causes a case-insensitive
operation on the string. Thus, for example, an "A" will match both "a" and "A".
Note that the strings placed in <tt>$1</tt>, <tt>$2</tt> and friends will still
retain their original case.
</p>

<p>
A <tt>g</tt> causes the match or substitution to match <b>all</b> occurences, 
not just one. If used with a match in an array context 
(e.g: <tt>@occurences = ($string =~ /$regexp/g);</tt>) it retrieves all 
the matches and if used with a substitution it substitutes all the
occurences with the string.
</p>

<p>
This example replaces all the occurences of the word "hello" by the index of
their occurence:
