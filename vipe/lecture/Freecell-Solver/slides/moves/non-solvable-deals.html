4.4 Non-Solvable Deals

<h3 class="notbold">
<ul>
<li>
Adrian Ettlinger sent me a few layouts he tested, with fewer Freecells
than usual, that Freecell Solver could not solve.
</li>
<li>
I realized that the reason Freecell Solver could not solve them was that
a meta-move moved two cards in the opposite manner that would allow
for a solution.
</li>
<li>
The only way I could think of to solve this without messing my code completely
would be to code move functions that would simply perform atomic moves.
</li>
<li>
It was not done, yet.
