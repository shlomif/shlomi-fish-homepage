<li>
gdb is the basic debugger. Many Linux debuggers are based on it.
</li>
<li>
Even though it does not have a fancy GUI, it does the trick. 
</li>
<li>
<b>In order to use gdb one must use the -g flag when compiling!</b>
</li>
<li>
Executing gdb is simple:  <tt>gdb program_name</tt> 
(it can be run differently but for that RTFM) 
</li>
<li>
gdb has an excellent built in help, you can type <tt>help</tt> from the 
gdb command line and get a list of stuff to get help on, or type 
<tt>help &lt;something&gt;</tt>, and get specific help on something - either 
a command or a topic name.
</li>
<li>
Another good source for help on gdb is the info pages. Type: <tt>pinfo gdb</tt>
or <tt>info gdb</tt> if <tt>pinfo</tt> is not available.
