<p>
My father and I visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>
(in the Netherlands) during a trip to Europe during the 1990 Passover vacation.
During one morning, we went to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh">Vincent van Gogh</a> museum,
and we were let in without being requested payment.
</p>

<p>
After we did an enjoyable tour of the exhibition, we walked out and noticed that
there was a long queue of people for the cashiers on a separate building.
