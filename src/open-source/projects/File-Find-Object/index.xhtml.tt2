<p>
The perl 5 distribution ships with the File::Find module, which can be used
to traverse directory trees. However, it has some serious limitations:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
It cannot be instantiated, and also makes use of some global variables.
</li>

<li>
It cannot be easily interrupted in the middle.
</li>

<li>
It does not have an iterative interface.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
File-Find-Object is a CPAN module, which was originally created by
<a href="http://metacpan.org/author/NANARDON">Olivier Thauvin</a> and
now mostly maintained by me (= Shlomi Fish) that aims to address these
limitations and more, and provide Perl programmers with a robust,
object-oriented and usable alternative.
</p>

<p>
Also available is <b>File-Find-Object-Rule</b>, which is a port of
File-Find-Rule to File-Find-Object. This gives Perl programmers a convenient,
declarative interface for File-Find-Object, while overcoming the limitations
of File::Find.

<p>
Version 0.0300 of File-Find-Object-Rule was released yesterday. The main
highlight of this release is that the iterative <code>-&gt;start()</code>
and <code>-&gt;match()</code> methods are now truly iterative and use
File-Find-Object to scan the tree incrementally, instead of building a long
list of results in memory, and then iterating over it.
</p>

<p>
Other, more minor, improvements included a cleanup of the code to use
[% xsac %], POD tests and full POD coverage, update of the documentation for
File-Find-Object-Rule (instead of the original File-Find-Rule) and more links
and keywords as META.yml meta-data.

<p>
Recently, File-Find-Object was benchmarked using a test program that
traversed a directory and printed the result. It turned out to run at
2 minutes (120 seconds) while File-Find did it at 4-5 seconds. As a result,
we spent a lot of time in optimising File-Find-Object, and now it does
the scan at about 30 seconds. These optimisations were integrated into
version 0.1.6 which was uploaded to CPAN today and will be available
shortly.
</p>

<p>
One thing to note is that we are now using [% xsac %] instead of [% cpan_self_dist( "d" => "Class-Accessor", ) %],
because the conversion yielded a substantial increase in speed. More
information can be found in the Changes file in the distribution.
