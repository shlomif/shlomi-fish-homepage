The <code>sprintf</code> built-in function can be used to translate a format
string with some conversions embedded inside, and some parameters into a
formatted string. Each conversion is specified by the starting character of the
percent sign (<code>%</code>), and can have a type and several parameters that will
dictate how it will be formatted in the output string. The output string is
returned by <code>sprintf</code>.

Here's an example that illustrates its use:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/sprintf/sprintf1.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
The output is:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
Hello "Nathan"! Your lucky number is 65.
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
As you can see, the first conversion is taken from the first argument, and the
second one from the second argument. That's how sprintf works: processing
the conversions from the arguments in order.
