<p>
There is an Israel-wide mathematics competition for teams of 4
high-school students from the same high school. During the 12th grade, I was
assigned in charge of forming the team, but many of my classmates whom I
perceived as bright and mathematically inclined, did not want to go. That was
possibly given the competition was hosted in the Technion in Haifa, whereas we
lived and studied in Tel Aviv (so the participants had to commute to there and
back and also miss a pedagogical study day and need to catch up from a
classmate).
</p>

<p>
I ended up travelling to the Technion by trains and buses with two other
students (called Ido and Esther) and as we were only able to solve 3 problems
out of the 9 in the competition’s problems’ sheet, we did not place. However,
we could take our copies of the sheets home with us, and so my classmates and I
tried to find solutions for the remaining problems.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I, with some assistance from my friends and classmates, was able to
solve all the problems in the sheet, except for one, which was a a geometrical
one. Moreover, Esther claimed she came up with different solutions to some of
the problems we had solved, that she wrote on paper pages at her home, but
could not readily reproduce. I was eager to see these elusive solutions,
especially given I could reproduce mine on the spot.
</p>

<p>
She first said she gave them to her boyfriend (who didn't study in our school)
for review and improvements, and then she said they had a fight. Eventually,
she brought the sheets to our class, but then refused to show them to me,
because she claimed I didn't greet her when she came to class (“good morning” /
etc.) and asked for them right away.
</p>

<p>
I still do not know what these solutions were, and do not understand why I
should have been punished on allegdly failing to greet her in the morning.
This is given <a

ethics</a> of forgiving. In <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_Minds">the film <i>Dangerous
Minds</i></a>, a high-school student is killed due to the principal
disapproving of him not knocking at the door. Anyway, for a while, I could
reconstruct my own solutions to the riddles on the spot, which Esther failed to
do for her own.
