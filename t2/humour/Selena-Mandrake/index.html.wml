<p>
A supernatural dramedie, this screenplay has many ties to my screenplay
<a href="$(ROOT)/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">Star Trek: “We, the
Living Dead”</a>, and was part of the grand Star Trek Deep Space Nine /
Buffy the Vampire Slayer / etc. great conspiracy theory thing that I imagined
in my “great mania” and that has inspired me ever since. It's very
farfetched, but on the other hand conveys many serious messages and insights.

Hope you enjoy it!
