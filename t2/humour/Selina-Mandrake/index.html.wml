<p>
A supernatural dramedie, this screenplay has many ties to my screenplay
<a href="$(ROOT)/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">Star Trek: “We, the
Living Dead”</a>, and was part of the grand Star Trek Deep Space Nine /
Buffy the Vampire Slayer / etc. great conspiracy theory thing that I imagined
in my “great mania” that has inspired me ever since. It’s very
far-fetched, but on the other hand conveys many serious messages and insights.

<p>
Hope you enjoy it!

Well, since this work is a parody of Buffy - The Vampire
Slayer (written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon">Joss
Whedon</a>), and contains characters from there,
I am theoretically protected by the Copyright’s
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use#Fair_use_and_parody">“right of
parody”</a> as part of the ”Fair Use” provision. There are other parodies of
Ayn Rand works online and possibly offline, and no one was sued yet.
</p>

<p>
This work uses other characters and concepts, from other copyright, and
already Public Domain works.

All the text in “Selina Mandrake - The Slayer” is original, and as far as
I’m concerned can be used under the terms of
<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">the Creative Commons

your option any later version</a>, but like I said, the situation is
more complicated than that.

<p>
I’m putting it here on this site in hope it will amuse or inspire
people, and also because it may encourage people to watch some episodes of
Buffy - The Vampire Slayer, Star Trek TNG/DS9, learn about Jewish culture,
read Dumas’
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers">The Three
Musketeers</a>, etc. all of which I can highly recommended. I’m not
charging people any money to download, build, or view the works, but I
have some web commercials which I’m making some small money from, and which
I hope are acceptable to the copyright holders. Please don’t sue me.
