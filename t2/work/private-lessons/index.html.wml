<subject "I'm Giving Private Lessons" />

<p>
I'm giving private lessons in either High School topics (Mathematics,
Computer Science, or Physics), or in Computers (C/C++, Perl, WWW 
Programming, Unix and Linux). I live in Northern Tel-Aviv.
Here's <a href="tutor-ad.sxw">my ad in OpenOffice Writer Format</a>,
and <a href="tutor-ad.pdf">here's the PDF version</a>. Spread the word!
