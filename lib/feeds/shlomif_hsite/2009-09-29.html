<!-- TITLE=New Slogans&#39; Art Page, New &quot;Objectivism and Open Source&quot; and Improvements to the Humour Pages-->
<p>
There's a new page in the "computer art" section with
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/art/slogans/" rel="nofollow">graphic designs for
    slogans in SVG formats</a>. Unless noted otherwise, they are licensed
under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" rel="nofollow">the Creative
    Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 (Unported) licence</a>. Next, I'm
planning to prepare some more designs, and make some merchandise based on them.
