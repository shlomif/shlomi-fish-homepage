<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://humanity.berlios.de/">Humanity</a> is a screenplay for a movie
that aims to be a parody about humanity and modern life in particular. It
tells the story of a day in the life of a Semitic city circa the year
500 B.C. Each scene is dedicated to one of the city's elements: The Cathedral
(ok - an altar with a priest), the Bazaar, the Well, the Wall, etc.
