<p>
Perl supports inserting variables into string constants simply by
placing their name along with the dollars inside them. Here's an example:
</p>

<quadpres_code_file filename="src/interpolate1.pl" />

<p>
Note that once perl encounters a <code>$</code>-sign, it will try to use as
many characters as possible from the string as the variable name,
even if a variable by that name does not exist. Therefore, if you write
<code>$xy</code> inside a string, it will not take the value of <code>$x</code> and
append the string "y" to it! To overcome this limitation, you can limit the
variable name using curly braces:
<code>"Hello ${boy}and${girl}"</code>.
</p>

<p>
In any case, interpolation is especially useful for building regular
expressions, since the string may contain control characters.
