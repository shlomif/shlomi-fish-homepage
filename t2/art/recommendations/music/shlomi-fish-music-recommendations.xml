                        A double album of the first years of my favourite 
                        English-singing band. Some pretty nifty songs, with
                        very revolutionary melodies and style.

                        The later Beatles' years. Songs have become more
                        expermintal, but also very good.

                <title>Greatest Hits</title>

                        I've been a fan of some of Shania Twain's MTv hits, and
                        downloaded them from Peer-to-Peer networks. One day
                        when I went to a local store looking for certain CDs, 
                        I saw her "Greatest Hits" compilation. Since I was
                        looking for other CDs, I did not buy it then, but
                        rather went another day and bought Twain's CD.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The CD did not disappoint me. With some great songs like
                        "Up", "Come on over", "Man, I feel like a woman!", 
                        "Any man of mine", "Party for Two", and my old
                        favourites "That don't impress me much", "You're Still
                        the One", and "I'm Gonna Getcha" - this CD is one of
                        my favourites. Shania Twain sings her country, (perhaps
                        pop country) songs in a fun way, and the arrangement is
                        very nice.
