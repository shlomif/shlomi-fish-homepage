<h1 class="fcs">5 File Input/Output</h1>

<p>
By now you are probably wondering how perl can be used to interact with
the external world, and this is where <b>File Input/Output</b> enters the
frame. 
</p>

<p>
In perl, file I/O is handled by using sessions: you are opening a file for
reading or writing (or both), do with it what you want, and then close it. 
In perl filehandles are placed on a separate namespace than that of the 
variables. It is generally marked with a starting asterik (<tt>*</tt>), which
can be omitted if the first letter is a capital one.
</p>

<p>
To open a file use the <tt>open MyFileHandle, $file_path;</tt> notation, and
to close a file use the <tt>close(MyFileHandle);</tt> notation. 
The first characters of <tt>$file_path</tt> determine whether the file will be 
open for reading, writing, appending or both. The following table should give 
you a quick reference:
</p>

<table border=1>


<tr>
<td>
&gt;
</td>
<td>
Writing (the original file will be erased before the function starts).
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>
&lt; (or nothing)
</td>
<td>
Reading
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
&gt;&gt;
</td>
<td>
Appending (the file pointer will start at the end and the file will not be
overriden)
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>
+&lt;
</td>
<td>
Read-write, or just write without truncating.
</td>

</table>

<p>
The rest of <tt>$file_path</tt> is the pathname of the file to open relative
to the script current working directory (<b>CWD</b>). For instance, the
command <tt>open I, "&lt;../hello.txt";</tt> opens the file "hello.txt" found
a directory below the current directory to reading.
</p>

<p>
Be careful on opening files whose filenames were inputted from the user. If 
not properly checked, you may open an improper file, or you may actually run
programs (we will learn about that later), or cause unexpected results.

<p>
Such badly written code was part of the problem in which the

Gibraltar Hack</a> against the PC-Week Linux test server was 
successful.
