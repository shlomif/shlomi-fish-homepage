<h1>DeCSS for JavaScript Embedding HTML</h1>

<p>
On this page: <a href="decss_js.html"><tt>decss_js.html</tt></a>, you can find 
an HTML file that powers the DeCSS for JavaScript source code. Note that its
decryption backend is _not_ DeCSS.
</p>

<p>
It is in fact a fake decryption code that decrypts according to Julius
Caesar’s method of rotating a letter by 3 places to encrypt it. If Julius
Caesar had been alive he could have sued me according to the DMCA, but since
he is not and I’m not aware of anyone who would use this trivial method for
his encryption we are safe.
</p>

<p>
To activate the HTML with the real DeCSS backend place both it and the 
<b>real</b> <tt>decss_js.js</tt> file in the same directory, assuming you know
what you are doing. I am not responsible for the results.
</p>

<p>
DeCSS for JavaScript opens a world of possibilities from DeCSS web-boxes,
to Distributed DeCSS (I’m not saying it’s a practical way of doing it, just
that it is possible). Or one could generate random sequences and instruct
the client computer to DeCSS them for him over and over again. As innocent
web-surfers now have the potential to become active violators of the DMCA -
it is time to question whether they or the DMCA are the irrational one.
