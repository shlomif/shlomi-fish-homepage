<latemp_subject "Open Source Software I wrote" />

<p>
I love computers, and I also like to program for fun, profit and ideals. I've 
been programming since I was 10 years old (back in 1987 for the PC XT ROM 
BASIC). Now in my free time I'm using a Linux machine for development, and 
am working on <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source 
Software</a>. I also maintain some software-related resources, and also have
some <a href="$(ROOT)/philosophy/computers/">essays about computing</a>.
