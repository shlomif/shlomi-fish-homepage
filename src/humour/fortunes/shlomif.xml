                    The prefix “God said” has the extraordinary logical property
                    of converting any statement that follows it into a true one.

                <p>A Jewish Deduction</p>

                <p> The Bible dictates that “Thou shalt not seethe [= cook] a
                    kid [= young goat] in his mother’s milk”. To avoid any
                    possibility of breaking that regulation, the Jewish
                    tradition ruled that it also applies to female goats, to
                    mature goats, and to the meat and milk of two completely
                    unrelated goats. It is also forbidden to eat the meat with
                    fresh milk, and it applies to beef and mutton as well
                    (including mixing the milk and meat of two different
                    beasts). Finally, chicken, which are incapable of milk
                    production, may not be eaten along with any mammal’s milk
                    either.  </p>

                <p> We are fortunate that most mathematicians were not Jewish.
                    Otherwise, it would have been forbidden to divide by all
                    numbers between -1 and 1.  </p>

                <p>“Oh,”, one of them said to me, “their number is growing geometrically. When I checked two weeks ago, their number was 2,148,763. A week ago there were 4,278,109 forbidden writings. Now there must be about 8,600,000 ones.”</p>

                <p>BTW, for an editor with no replace feature (at least not on

                <p>Suggested Improvements to the Documentation:</p>

                <p>The WYSIWYT project was for a long time fascinated by
                    Microsoft’s tremendous desire to advance its Internet
                    Explorer web-browser. We saw the fact that they switched
                    the help systems of the upcoming Windows 98, as well as
                    Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0, to HTML a major step in advancing
                    our project.</p>

                <p>As a complementary step, some of the chief heads of our
                    project suggested that the Windows’ manuals themselves, as
                    well as all of Microsoft’s ads, will be designed in HTML
                    and printed after being rendered by IE 4. While this project
                    is in the preliminary and planning stages, we expect it to
                    acquire a large momentum soon.</p>

                <p>I know I’m blond, but I have to colour my hair brown, so
                    people would not think I’m stupid. Because, like the title
                    of the book says: "You’ve only got Three Seconds".</p>

                <p>Actually, since Amazon sent us two books like that, you’ve
                    only got six seconds.  </p>

<p>
Shlomi,

Have you ever considered taking a Turing test? ;-)
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
&lt;sarcasm&gt;<br />
Sure I did. I sat at one point of an IRC channel, and someone
tested me. Eventually it was discovered that I am a computer, but it
turned out the other side was an Eliza program. Strangely enough, I could
not detect that the latter fact was true.<br />
&lt;/sarcasm&gt;

<p>
Can anyone draw a plan as to how to teach a computer to laugh? Say we
define laugh as print “LOL”, and define smile as print “:)”. How would a
computer know when to print any of those, and when to operate an Eliza
program?
</p>

<p>
Judging by IRC or AOL, randomly would do just fine. 😉.

KImageShop is seriously lacking in developers, and the GIMP is to blame

                <p>&gt; Thanks, applied as change #22936.</p>

                <p> And thank you for applying this patch. But to be honest,
                    I’m a little disappointed. I expected it won’t go in so
                    easily and will trigger some discussion here. But there was
                    none. No typo corrections (“you misspelled
                    ‘floccinaucinihilipilification’”); no flames ("this patch
                    is the worst thing since non-sliced bread"). Nothing.</p>

                <p> Someone should do something about it. This direction is not
                    healthy for p5p. Seriously.</p>

                <p>[Commenting in Slashdot after Arnold Schwarzenegger’s
                    decision to use open-source software in the California
                    government:]</p>

                <p>&gt; This is obviously because Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are
                    girly men. </p>

                <p>Yeah and what are the offerings of the open-source world?
                    Let’s see: </p>

                <p>1. Linus Torvalds - Looks like a dweeb, ergo is a dweeb. How
                    girly is that?  (plus his wife can kick ass better than
                    him) 2. Richard M. Stallman - a hippy. How girly is that?
                    3. Eric S. Raymond - a nice looking man with a moustache.
                    Baby faced, so he looks a bit girly to me.  4. Larry Wall -
                    a cross between Linus and RMS (i.e: a hippy dweeb) that is
                    even more girly. </p>

                <p>So who do we have left? Alan Cox? OK, he’s manly. (huge man,
                    huge facial hair, etc.) And all the others are so negligible
                    people don’t even know how they look like. </p>

                <p>Note: this comment may have been a bit cruel, so sorry.
                    Don’t take it too seriously, especially if you’re one of
                    the guys I laughed about. I hold you all with the greatest
                    respect. Seriously. </p>

                <p>Sincerely yours, <br /> Shlomi Fish (who is a quite girly
                    male himself).</p>

                <p>The first phrase that should be taught when teaching a new
                    language is how to say “Do you speak English?”.  </p>

                <p> The first thing that needs to be taught when teaching a new
                    computer tool is how to exit it.</p>

                    alternative to know that something sucks. Take Microsoft

                <p>The bad thing about hardware is that it sometimes works and
                    sometimes doesn’t.  The good thing about software is that
                    it’s consistent: it always does not work, and it always
                    does not work in exactly the same way.</p>

Maybe so, but how else can CPANTS detect that you use the world’s most

CVS is not advanced as:

<li>
<p>
Microsoft Visual SourceSafe - the only sane choice for good data integrity
and portability.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
tarballs/zip-files and patches. This one excels in convenience, and
robustness.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
CVS is a very advanced version control system, however. I do wish that
Subversion (which is a VCS that I have to use against my will) was as good as
it is.

                <p>Hi Omer! Mazal Tov on Chen and yours marriage. It reminds me
                    of a quote from Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre:</p>


                <p>"At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
                    clergyman, an excellent man, <b>almost worthy of such a
                        wife</b>) to a distant county, and consequently was
                    lost to me."</p>

                <p>Well, in your case I can say that both of you are almost
                    worthy of each other.  Congrats again!</p>

                <p>A few weeks ago, I’ve been to Freenode’s #perl, talking to
                    merlyn and other guys, when we got to discuss the Biblical
                    "Tower of Babel Myth". As it turned out, the commonly
                    perceived interpretation was not the one most scholars find
                    as more sensible, which is the one we ended up being taught
                    at Junior High School. </p>


                <p>What most people think is something like that: </p>


                <blockquote>
                    <p> The people spoke to each other in the same
                        language, concentrated in one place, and decided to
                        build a tower high enough so they can reach God. God, a
                        small dwarf who lived in the sky, was afraid of the
                        efforts of these people, because he feared they’ll
                        reach him. So he cast an 8th level Spell of Language
                        Fragmentation, caused these people to speak in
                        different tongues, and without being able to understand
                        each other, they ended up spreading across the Earth.
                        God was relieved and returned to his dwarfish deeds, as
                        dwarfs do.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
This reminds me of Paul Graham’s articles, in which he claims that LISP
programmers are better. But why is it so (whether or not you agree to the
conclusion)? There are at least two opposite reasons: 1. Because programmers
that learned LISP become better 2. Because good programmers prefer LISP when
they come to know it.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
No. 1 is true, naturally. No. 2 is not true - I know LISP but I prefer Perl.
Others like Python, etc. The reasons I don’t prefer LISP are:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
The standards of Common LISP and Scheme don’t define anything practical.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
LISP is at the moment incredibly verbose.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
As Larry Wall noted, all LISP code comes in parenthesis and so it all looks
the same. (Perl is the exact opposite in this regard).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I cannot make heads nor tails of serious LISP code. Many LISPers create so
many macros and use them along with regular LISP code, so you keep having to
refer to the previous definitions, and make a lot of research to get you
started.
</p>
</li>

</ol>


<p>
SICP Scheme is easy and fun. But serious LISP code can take too much time to
understand. OTOH, recently I had little problem reading the source code of
other Perl programmers, and extending it or fixing bugs. (likewise for
Python).

                <p>A few days ago I joined #mandriva on Freenode trying to get
                    to the bottom of a problem I have with KMail at work, where
                    I cannot start KAddressBook from inside it. I asked my
                    question and soon afterwards received:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>One Thunderbird recommendation.</li>
                    <li>Two Evolution recommendations.</li>
                    <li>One Sylpheed Claws recommendation.</li>
                    <li>One GMail recommendation.</li>
                </ul>


                <p>The problem is that I wasn’t interested to learn about
                    alternative E-mail clients, and just wanted to get my
                    problem solved. And in GMail’s case it was completely out
                    of the question due to my work’s constraints. </p>

                <p>I recently had to figure out how to do something with wget:
                    get everything below a directory on the web-server, without
                    following links to outside it. So I logged in to Freenode’s
                    #debian channel, where there are many knowledgeable people
                    to ask it. The first answer I got was "RTFM". So, I read
                    the wget man page, but could not find it there. Eventually,
                    after telling people that it would be faster to give an
                    answer, I got a reply ( add the -np -r flags). But this has
                    been the last straw. </p>


                <p>I composed my own acronym. Just like RTFM is "Read the
                    Fabulous Manual" and STFW is "Search the Fabulous Web",
                    then JATFM is "Just Answer the Fabulous Man". It means that
                    it’s usually faster to answer someone’s question than to
                    ask him to RTFM, which is just going to annoy him. I think
                    the RTFM mantra has done a lot of damage in the UNIX/Linux
                    world, and I hope JATFMing would prove to be a more healthy
                    ideology. </p>

I don’t suppose we should propose that as an alternative to Perl gods, there
should at least be Perl saints:

Of course, I’m not sure what being a Perl saint would imply. Using nothing but
Perl? (Including not C in which perl 5 is written?)

<p>
Oh well.

Not that I mind the Perl gods stereotype stuff.

Please. The Nazi’s were socialists. I’m a little to the right of Attila the
Hun.

And I thought Attila was a Humanitarian.

                I often wonder why I keep hanging with so many people, even
                though they are so pedantic.  And then I remember - because
                they are so pedantic.

                <p> &lt;monty-python&gt; </p>



                <p> A: You Linux kids are so lucky. When we were using Windows
                    95 and Windows 3.11 it kept getting stuck and we lost all
                    our data. We had to reboot it.  </p>



                <p> B: You used Windows 95! Lucky Bastard! When I was your age,
                    we used DOS on CGA screens, and we were lucky if we had 4
                    colours, much less a true windowing environment.  </p>



                <p> C: You had DOS with graphics? Lucky bastard! When I was
                    your age, I used VT-100 terminals connected to a VAX. 128
                    characters should be enough for everybody?  </p>



                <p> D: Visual Terminals? When I was your age, we used teletypes
                    on a PDP-11: the computer printed on paper - very slowly.
                    Can you imagine cat’ing a really long document?  </p>



                <p> E: Teletypes were heaven compared to the punch cards that I
                    was using. Imagine going over to the computer with a large
                    amount of punch cards and then dropping them all.  </p>

                <p> F: Punch cards! What is this talk about punch cards? We
                    input machine code directly using buttons and LEDs.
                </p>

                <p> G: And all <b>we</b> had were NAND gates!  </p>

                <p> &lt;/monty-python&gt; </p>

                <p> <b>Kilmo:</b> why would you like to make fun of the
                    crypto world ? ;) The NSA does know what you did last
                    summer.  And by putting this on the web, they know that you
                    know.  </p>


                <p> Which may lead to interesting philosophical issues. BTW, in
                    a conference I was attending we were given a sticker
                    saying: "NSA - free email backup".  </p>


                <p> They still have some issue with the retrieval procedures,
                    but besides of that  - they are quite a trusted service.
                </p>


                <p> <b>Shlomi Fish:</b> In my case, I think every random Joe
                    can learn a lot about me. Even if he’s not in Google or the
                    NSA or whatever.  </p>


                <p> <b>Kilmo:</b> Yep. But this is a world-wide service that
                    they offer. (Along with several co-operations, like MI5/6).

                <p> Richard M. Stallman (RMS) decides to release his brand-new
                    editor, "Emacs" on the CPAN with its first version
                    29.999.99.  In order to package it, he invokes the trusty
                    ol’ module-starter (see
                    http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Starter/) which creates
                    a skeleton of a CPAN distribution for him.  </p>



                <p> He fills in the skeleton with the actual code of Emacs,
                    types "perl Build.PL", and "./Build test" and makes sure
                    all the tests pass. Then he types "./Build config --gui"
                    and gets a nice GUI to configure the various parameters of
                    the Module meta-data.[M-B-Data] </p>



                <p> In the GUI, Richard goes to the Trove categorisation tab,
                    and selects categories. This is done in a similar way to
                    Freshmeat’s project categorisation dialog (a list of
                    options to the left, with selected options to the right and
                    arrows to move them left or right, while allowing multiple
                    select options.).  He chooses such categories as
                    "Programming Language :: Lisp", and "Intended Audience ::
                    Emacs Users", "Operating System :: GNU", and "Topic ::
                    Editors". (Note: I believe the category list should be
                    fetched using a public web-service to keep them
                    up-to-date.) </p>

            <body>


                <p> After several weeks of having the editor on CPAN, Richard
                    has received many patches, and wrote a lot of code on his
                    own. Now Emacs is not only an editor but a calendar tool,
                    an Eliza program, a web browser, a mail user agent and many
                    other things.  </p>

                <p> So in order to release version 30.000.00 he needs to update
                    the categorisation.  He runs ./Build config --gui again,
                    and adds more categories. However, he enters too many
                    categories (because Emacs now does them all), and the GUI
                    refuses  to save the file because it will overflow the
                    limit that the web-service specified the CPAN
                    classification services allow to handle. So Richard keeps
                    only the important categories, adds more tags, and saves
                    it.  </p>

                <p> He then tests the distribution again, and uploads the new
                    distribution to the CPAN.  </p>

                <p> Bill Gates, CEO of Microsoft decides to use Richard
                    Stallman’s Emacs as the basis of his company’s
                    state-of-the-art product Microsoft Editing Macros™
                    Enterprise Edition XP .NET Professional. However since MS
                    Editing Macros™ is a commercial, proprietary program which
                    he intends to sell at computer stores, Bill is not going to
                    upload it to the CPAN. He builds upon Emacs, sends patches
                    to  Richard and learns a lot about it.  </p>



                <p> When he’s finished building Microsoft Editing Macros™ he
                    surfs to the Emacs homepage on CPAN, and adds some
                    categories and tags of his own.  </p>



                <p> Eventually, enough people like Bill tag and categorise
                    Emacs, and it gains more classification.  </p>

                <p> Well, it’s not a threat - it’s a warning, and he won’t be
                    harmed much by acting against my advice. A threat is
                    something like "Stop posting political posts or I will burn
                    your house, rape your wife and daughters, banish you to the
                    middle of Antarctica, convert all your Perl code to PHP, and
                    then post it on thedailywtf.com."
                </p>



                <p> Regarding what you say that "no one cares if you
                    unsubscribe", then this reminds me of what Fred Brooks says
                    in "The Mythical Man-Month": "How does a project becomes
                    late? One day at a time.". If you’re not careful, you might
                    lose a large percent of your blog’s readership, one
                    subscriber at a time.

                <p>PHP error debug list:</p>


                <p>1) did you use the correct argument order? if you’re a good
                    programmer, use the *reverse* from what you think it is.
                    see if it works. no? you’re not a good programmer, or you
                    learned PHP’s braindeadness and can go on to step 2).</p>


                <p> 2) did you think about your code? if so, don’t. PHP will do
                    it for you so you can do mindbogglingly stupid stuff, such
                    as not escape the data that goes into your SQL queries.

            <body>

            <p> Mike “The Mouse“ House (a.k.a “D.J. Salinger”) was a rap artist
            who experienced only limited success, and a computer geek, when he
            decided to start selling CDs of open-source software.  He turned to
            spamming to publicise his business, but realised that most of the
            spam messages he sent were blocked by E-mail filters. He decided to
            use the notorious obscured image spam, but since he had a few blind
            friends, he opted to also include an audio recording of a rap song
            with the message.  </p>

            <p> House received a few offers from his spam campaign, but his
            real break came when a few enthusiasts of the spam song shared it
            on the Internet, where it became an instant hit. The song
            eventually hit the charts and MTV, and made D.J. Salinger famous,
            who quickly released his first successful album called <i>Rap to
            the spam, Ma’am!</i>, with such highly acclaimed hits as “Rap to
            not get trapped” and “He ain’t Nigerian. He’s a Spammer!”.  </p>

            <p> As a millionaire, House decided to donate some of his money
            back to sponsoring open-source projects, and has donated 100,000s
            of U.S. Dollars to such causes as <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">the
            Free Software Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.li.org/">Linux
            International</a> and <a
            href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</a>. “If it
            hadn’t been for them, I wouldn’t have made it big”, he said, and
            said he’s now working on a second album with a similar theme.  </p>

        <quote>
            <body>

                <p> All languages of the world suck. If you require people to
                    declare variables (like in Pascal, C, <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29">Scheme</a>
                    or Perl 5 with <a
                        href="http://perldoc.perl.org/strict.html">strict</a>),
                    then people will tell you they like variables to spring up
                    upon first use. Without variable declarations, then you get
                    various weird side-effects of the implicit scoping. If you
                    use curly braces for scoping, then you’ll have to type more
                    and there’s more clutter. With indentation-based scoping
                    (like in Python), you’ll find it hard to introduce
                    multiple-expression <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#First-class_functions">lambdas</a>.</p>

                <p>Rob Pike and Paul Graham hated object oriented programming
                    (OOP) and so they didn’t introduce it in their <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29">“Go”</a>
                    and <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_%28programming_language%29">“Arc“</a>
                    languages, well after OOP has become mainstream. And guess
                    what? Many people, including me, think that OOP is still a
                    good thing (and no, in my opinion, C++ did not do OOP very
                    well) and so gave up on Arc quickly and did not look
                    closely at Go.</p>

                <p>Dynamically typed languages (like Perl 5, Python, Ruby, or
                    Lisp) possibly suffer from many subtle errors;
                    Statically typed languages (like Haskell) are less
                    expressive and it seems that about one third of the
                    language design papers published on <a
                        href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/">Lambda the
                        Ultimate</a> are about various funky extensions to the
                    Haskell type system to allow for better expressiveness.</p>

                <p>Purely functional languages have no assignment and most
                    people find them harder, in part because the world around
                    us has a lot of state, and they also need to do funky
                    compiler tricks to make you feel like you don’t need
                    assignment. Non-functional languages have side-effects and
                    so are prone to many errors.</p>

                <p>If you have goto or goto-like statements (such as exceptions
                    or Perl 5’s “last LABEL;” (more like “break” in C) or
                    “next LABEL;”), then you encourage code to not be factored
                    correctly. If you don’t have such stuff, then programmers
                    will hate you for having to go through many hoops to write
                    quick-and-dirty code.</p>

                <p>Perl 5 has a dedicated regular expression syntax which is
                    treated magically by the parser. PHP and Java use strings
                    for them, and require weird escaping and backslashing rules
                    to interpolate the sub-regexes inside them. And if you
                    incorporate a first-order syntax for regular expressions,
                    then people will want similar first-order syntaxes for
                    XPath, for XML (like some recent versions of Visual Basic
                    .NET have), and for all other grammars you may need to
                    embed.</p>

                <p>Finally, many people absolutely hate all the clutter created
                    by the leading <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_%28computer_programming%29">sigils</a>
                    of Perl 5 (the "$", "@", etc.), and similar languages, but
                    they allow for much better backward compatibility,
                    facilitate the so-called “interpolation” (= embedding
                    inside strings), and also give some important visual cues
                    when skimming code (even without syntax highlighting).</p>

<saying who="rindolf">Hi all.</saying>
<saying who="srogers">howdy</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">srogers: hi, what&#39;s up?</saying>
<saying who="srogers">work, mostly</saying>
<saying who="srogers">&quot;one of those days&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Work.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I&#39;m enjoying my unemployed status.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And after all that hospital thing is behind me, I&#39;d like to go to tau.ac.il and set up some events where I read from my writings/etc.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">To gain some esteem.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I contacted an Israeli publisher about publishing some of my stories and/or essays, but they didn&#39;t return to me after more than a month (which is their designated limit).</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And after reminding them on the phone, I gave up.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, I&#39;m not going to sit idly and expect recognition to come to me.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Maybe I&#39;ll use some of my Project Wonderful money to gain some publicity.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I could try publicising some of my works on various sites such as http://www.calamitiesofnature.com/</saying>
<saying who="srogers">Yeah - promote yourself</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">srogers: yes.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">srogers: I  think that was the main mistake of Howard Roark in The Fountainhead.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">He should have worked more on publicity.</saying>
<saying who="srogers">ha - if only he had Facebook . . .</saying>

<saying who="mrout">Who likes freedom?</saying>
<saying who="mrout">FREEDOM</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: freedom++</saying>
<saying who="Younos">just give me my beer</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Younos: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">No beer for you!</saying>
<saying who="Younos">aww :o(</saying>
<saying who="mrout">I’m in non-freedom mode atm actually, using Windoze</saying>
<saying who="mrout">for the gamez</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: OK.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">but when I restart into Linux I respect the freedoms of myself and others</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: OK.</saying>
<saying who="Younos">you should respect it regardless of the platform</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: maybe try reporting it as a bug in WINE/etc.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: the GNU project encourages FOSS developers to port their software to  non-free platforms.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Though there was a small backlash about it (at least for Windows) a while ago.</saying>
<saying who="alfplayer">encourages?</saying>
<saying who="mrout">rindolf: I sure hope it does. if we can encourage users to try FOSS software on non-free platforms, they might more easily learn about FOSS and about how to protect their freedoms</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/download.html - I provide a Windows binary for this. :-)</saying>
<saying who="mrout">Many users don’t even know they can get software that respects their freedoms.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">alfplayer: well, don&#39;t know if encourage, but it doesn&#39;t hold a stand against it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">alfplayer: and a lot of GNU software can be built fine on Windows (And proprietary UNIXes).</saying>
<saying who="alfplayer">rindolf: that&#39;s very different imo</saying>
<saying who="alfplayer">rindolf: yes, like gcc and emacs</saying>
<saying who="mrout">btw is rms ever on here? He gave a talk at my local university a few years ago, and I never got a chance to talk to him.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=should-perl-drop-sco-support - also see this.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">LOL</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: I don&#39;t think he uses IRC.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: he also doesn&#39;t use a graphical web browser.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: though he does read the web sometimes.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">rindolf: i haven’t installed X yet, so neither do I. haha</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">He commented on a few pages on my site.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">When he visited Israel, I told RMS that I felt making Freecell Solver Public Domain (now it&#39;s MIT/X11L) was appropriate given its target audience, and he said he thought making it GPLed would encourage more users of programs that used it to make them FOSS.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">He also said it was OK that freshmeat.net (now freecode.com) did not release their backend as free software.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: ah.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">freecode.com?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: well, I think he doesn&#39;t even use links or lynx or Emacs&#39; www-mode.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: yes.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: they changed their name and domain.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">who are they? NEVER heard of them</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: http://freecode.com/ - it&#39;s a nice way to discover some interesting software.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: they are a web-directory for UNIX software.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">do they host it?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: no.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">quite unlike something like github, then?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: just link to it.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">cool</saying>
<saying who="mrout">will try to remember that</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: also see http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Freecell-Solver/slides/freshmeat_effect.html</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: not everything there is FOSS.</saying>
<saying who="mtjm">http://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html explains his Web use</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: and not everything is there.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: but I try to publicise most of my major software there.</saying>
<saying who="mtjm">IRC would need a constant network access which is difficult when travelling (and needs much more time than batch mail writing)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, most of the software published there is either niche or quite boring.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">rindolf: Freecell Solver on freecode is the first result</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: for what?</saying>
<saying who="mrout">that google search</saying>
<saying who="mrout">I fail to see a problem</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: well, thing is there are other Freecell solvers.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: and what I said is that I clog the search.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">Oh, I see what you mean</saying>
<saying who="mrout">that’s a good thing for you, though</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: lots of junk like FreeBSD/Debian/Ubuntu/Mandriva/Mageia packages.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: that&#39;s what I call the freshmeat effect.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I get http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/ as the first hit. :-(</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Damn bubbling.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=freecell%20solver - here (no bubbling) I get the wikipedia Freecell page as a first hit.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">rindolf: bubbling?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: http://dontbubble.us/</saying>
<saying who="mrout">I get NZ results</saying>
<saying who="mrout">hahaha</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: NZ?</saying>
<saying who="mrout">rindolf: where are you from?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: Israel.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">New Zealand.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: but shlomifish.org is hosted in hostgator.com .</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I used to host it in a small Israeli hosting provider but they were too unreliable.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">I asked, because i expected it to be US, and so I’d say “I know what US stands for, but you don’t know what NZ stands for? Shame on you.”</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: I know that .nz is New Zealand.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: but didn&#39;t understand the initialism in the context.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: some Americans think .il is Illinois.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And .ca is California.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, there&#39;s also .la.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">ahh</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And .tv.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">haha</saying>
<saying who="mrout">tv? that must be for Tajikistan. &gt;.&gt;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: no.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.tv</saying>
<saying who="mrout">joke</saying>
<saying who="mrout">that was a joke</saying>
<saying who="mrout">I know it’s not for television stuff, LOL</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuvalu</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">.tk domains are free.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">yeah</saying>
<saying who="mrout">Woo tokelau</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">wonders if there is .fs.</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">There should be a country called .if so I can register shlom.if</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Someone registered shlomifi.sh. ;-)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Not me, though.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">https://www.google.com/search?q=.lf - no .lf either.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">We need more countries.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">I wish there was a .ut</saying>
<saying who="mrout">so I could get mro.ut</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, I can register shlomif.name.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">I already have rout.co.nz (that’s my dad’s actually) and rout.geek.nz (mine)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Are top-level .nz domains available?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">like rout.nz</saying>
<saying who="mrout">you can’t get milesroutisawesome.nz, no</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Ah.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">or rout.nz &gt;.&gt;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">.il domains are kinda costly and they used to require faxing.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And I don&#39;t feel my domains are particularly Israeli-related.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">ahh</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, I originally got shlomif.il.eu.org.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">But its DNS was flaky.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">.eu.org?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">So I ended up buying shlomifish.org</saying>
<saying who="mrout">what’s your actual name?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Now I also have shlomifish.com</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout:  Shlomi Fish.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">Ahh</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: eu.org is free DNS.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">But I guess you get what you pay for sometimes.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: it&#39;s not .eu (European union).</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: http://eu.org/</saying>
<saying who="mrout">that site’s odd</saying>
<saying who="mrout">what’s wrong with .eu</saying>
<saying who="mrout">shit a brick, they want a separate ccTLD for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Martin_(France)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: nothing is wrong with .eu - it&#39;s just that eu.org is something different.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">eu.org predates .eu.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">ahh</saying>
<saying who="mrout">it annoys me that the US doesn’t use .us more</saying>
<saying who="mrout">and clutters .com</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, there&#39;s also .gov, .net, .org...</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">.mil</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">.navy</saying>
<saying who="mrout">exactly</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: I also have http://shlom.in/</saying>
<saying who="mrout">it’s pretty americo-centric</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Could not get http://shlom.fi/ because my domain registrar did not have it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">shlom.in is my own custom (and private) URL shortener.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Some overzealous spam filters blocked it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Ah, domains.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">The bread and butter of Internet conversations.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">LOL</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I know someone who has http://ali.as/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, from the Internet.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And there&#39;s also cr.yp.to which is Dan Bernstein.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">DJB.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">domains, vim vs emacs and hello_there vs helloThere.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">cr.yp.to is cool</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: and tabs vs. spaces.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">but hard to type</saying>
<saying who="mrout">eugh</saying>
<saying who="mrout">cr.yp.to is hard to type</saying>
<saying who="mrout">spaces, vim, hello_there or HelloThere, but never helloThere.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Since I have http://perl-begin.org/ and want to create a site for Vim beginners, I should get a good domain.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vim.perl-begin.org or vim.shlomifish.org does not look good.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">vimschlomfish</saying>
<saying who="mrout">LOL</saying>
<saying who="mrout">shlom</saying>
<saying who="mrout">vimshlomfish</saying>
<saying who="mrout">what about vim-begin.org?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: maybe I&#39;ll get tech-begin.org</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I think begin.org is already taken.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">yea</saying>
<saying who="mrout">by one of those shitty domain hoggers</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Heh. begin.tel is available. \o/</saying>
<saying who="mrout">i’d love mil.es</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Not that I want it.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">begin.tel?</saying>
<saying who="mrout">begintel?</saying>
<saying who="mrout">$17/yr for mil.es</saying>
<saying who="mrout">YES FUCK YES</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">OK, I registered begin-site.org and begin-site.com</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">On https://www.domainsite.com/ .</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I figured most people won&#39;t &quot;guess&quot; begin-site.net... ;-)</saying>
<saying who="mrout">nice</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">So I&#39;ll have http://vim.begin-site.com/ and http://vim.begin-site.org/</saying>
<saying who="mrout">what about rindolf.com</saying>
<saying who="mrout">begin-site seems a bit clunky</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: rindolf is only my IRC nickname.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">still</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: and I already have www.shlomifish.org</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: I don&#39;t see why most people will STFW for &quot;rindolf&quot; or &quot;shlomi fish&quot; or whatever.</saying>

                <p>
                    I recall discussing Buffy with a Jewish American friend,
                    who used to be secular, and now has become an observant
                    Jew, and married a woman who properly converted to
                    Orthodox Judaism, and they have some children. We
                    discussed the fact
                    that Sarah Michelle Gellar was Jewish, and yet that many
                    men (and some Lesbian women) were more attracted to Alyson
                    Hannigan’s character, Willow Rosenberg, who was a shy and
                    sheepish, redhead, Jewess. Then when I mentioned that
                    Hannigan was only a maternal Jew, he said she is “kosher”
                    (because someone whose mother is Jewish and who did not
                    convert to a different religion, is a bona-fide Jew). I
                    found it amusing that you refer to women by the same word
                    as you do to food, but I think the ancient Hebrew word
                    "kasher" also means "approved", "appropriate", "legal",
                    etc.

                    In any case, both Hannigan and Gellar are now married,
                    and so trying to separate between them and their husbands
                    is not kosher. ;-)

            <body>

                <p> The Israelites and the Philistines schedule a large battle.
                    The Philistines have far superior equipment with armours
                    made out of iron, which the Israelites don’t have.
                    Eventually, Goliath, a tall Philistine giant, steps forward
                    and asks for an Israelite man worthy enough to fight him
                    and determine the fate of the battle (something which was
                    quite common in the ancient Near East). It seems the
                    Israelites will lose the battle.  </p>

                <p> Out of nowhere, a young Israelite boy whom hardly anyone
                    knew about steps forward with a sling and a few pebbles.
                    Goliath thinks this is ridiculous and ridicules him.
                    However, the boy quickly puts a pebble in his sling, and
                    after rotating the sling to achieve a very large speed
                    (not unusual with slings) hurls the pebble with great
                    accuracy (also not unthinkable, because shepherds in the
                    Near East effectively used slings to kill lions and other
                    predators to their flock) into Goliath’s face, which was
                    uncovered to allow him to see. Even if Goliath’s shield
                    bearer wanted to, he could not lift the huge shield in
                    time, and Goliath was completely not agile in his suit and
                    armour. The sling’s rock smashes Goliath’s brain, and he
                    falls to the ground dead. The Israelites have won the
                    battle.  </p>

                <p> That boy’s name was David. </p>

                <p> Why is it important here? Because David was a “hacker”.  Why
                    was he a hacker?  Because he knew the rules, and played by
                    them, but knew how to bend them, in order to earn his
                    victory. Hackers bend the rules.  </p>

                <p> And here’s the thing: this is what an action hero is all
                    about: he makes his own rules, or he even breaks them, and
                    does not accept his fate. This is whereas a tragic hero is
                    bound by many invisible rules, and accepts his fate, which
                    is, almost certainly going to be death.  </p>

                <p>And in real life, you should also aim to be a hacker or
                    an action hero, or the many phrases it used to be called.  </p>

<saying who="ZetaNeta">i wonder, if one day, developers will lose the possibility to write code no one else can understand.</saying>
<saying who="ZetaNeta">If CPUs will start running interpretable code</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: you can always obfuscate code.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: nothing guarantees that a code will be readable.</saying>
<saying who="ZetaNeta">yeah, that is why i wish people will lose the ability to write unreadable code</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: and there&#39;s also https://github.com/kripken/emscripten which compiles from C/C++/ObjC/etc. to unreadable JS.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: how will you guarantee that?</saying>
<saying who="ZetaNeta">I cant. Thats why i wish</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: have you heard of the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: it may be impossible for a computer to do.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: if not for a human too.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: don&#39;t wish for the impossible.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: unless you&#39;d also like to wish for pink flying unicorn ponies who drop candy.</saying>
<saying who="ZetaNeta">I don’t like pink, unicorns, ponies, candy and dropping stuff.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: it&#39;s an idiom that means that you want something that can&#39;t easily be achieved.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: or something Utopian or unrealistic.</saying>
<saying who="ZetaNeta">well... that is already way too offtopic</saying>
<saying who="sea">Morning!!!!!!!!</saying>
<me_is who="sea">appears and has cake!</me_is>
<me_is who="sea">distributes cake</me_is>
<saying who="[TheFlash]">maybe you meant a cross between a unicorn and a pony?</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">eats the free-as-in-speech cake.</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">Also zen cake - no calories.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">[TheFlash]: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pink%20flying%20unicorn%20ponies</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">[TheFlash]: they exist in /My Little Pony/ - ♥</saying>
<saying who="sea">Those actually are pegasus ponies.</saying>
<saying who="sea">Unicorn ponies don&#39;t fly.</saying>
<saying who="sea">There are some unicorn pegasus ponies, though</saying>
<saying who="sea">Like princess Luna</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">sea: yes.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">sea: isn&#39;t Princess Celestia also a Unicorn Pegasus Pony?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, this isn&#39;t #bronies</saying>
<saying who="sea">Yeah, they&#39;re called an &#39;alicorn&#39; officially now</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">sea: ah.</saying>
<saying who="sea">Also, starting with the last episode of season 3, Twilight Sparkle is an Alicorn too</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">sea: I don&#39;t remember who she is.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">sea: http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Twilight_Sparkle - ah ,  I see.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">sea: yes, I know who she is (naturally).</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">OK, on topic.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: it&#39;s probable that people (or software programs) will always be able to write other programs that other people will find hard to understand, so don&#39;t wish for it to happen.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: you might be able to find a device that will change the laws of logic, but I find it unlikely.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, find or develop.</saying>
<saying who="ZetaNeta">rindolf, Well. I have some ideas</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: ideas?</saying>
<saying who="ZetaNeta">In my understanding, there is no logic.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: what?</saying>
<me_is who="ZetaNeta">don’t wanna talk about it</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: you don&#39;t think there&#39;s logic?</saying>
<saying who="pehjota">TIL that sea is a brony.  They&#39;re everywhere!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pehjota: heh.</saying>
<me_is who="ZetaNeta">doesn’t like to mix software with philosophy, to avoid long conversations he anyway probably gonna lose</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: well, programming is based on maths and logic.</saying>
<saying who="ZetaNeta">rindolf, &quot;Because you are so sure about it&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: what?</saying>
<me_is who="ZetaNeta">doesn’t like to mix software with philosophy, to avoid long pointless conversations</me_is>
<saying who="sea">pehjota: What&#39;s TIL?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">sea: Today I learned.</saying>
<saying who="pehjota">sea: Today I learned.</saying>
<saying who="sea">Whoa..</saying>
<saying who="pehjota">Ha :)</saying>
<saying who="sea">Haha, your nicks both have the same length</saying>
<saying who="sea">so it looks like a duplicated line</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">sea: jinx!</saying>
<me_is who="sea">grabs everything made of wood and hides it</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">ZetaNeta: anyway, the Halting Problem which is part of theoretical CS, and has an easy-to-explain informal proof, casts many doubts about a machine&#39;s (or a human&#39;s) ability to detect whether code for an arbitrary Turing complete VM is easy to understand or not, and so you might as well forget about it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">&lt;pehjota&gt; TIL that sea is a brony.  They&#39;re everywhere! ==&gt; not sure how useful of a fact it is.</saying>
<saying who="pehjota">rindolf: It was a tongue-in-cheek remark. :)</saying>

            <title>How to Achieve World Domination?</title>
        </meta>
        <quote>
            <body>

                <p> A lot of people think that the proper way to achieve world
                    domination is to create an <a
                        href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">architecture
                        that will solve the whole world’s problems and then
                        some</a>. We’ve been seeing quite a few of them since
                    <i>Joel on Software</i> wrote this article: Ruby, Google
                    Go, Node.js, Mozilla’s Rust, Clojure, Scala, Perl 6, etc.
                    Some of them have or will mature to something truly nice,
                    or have inspired a lot of features in other languages, but
                    it’s hard for plain-old-single-you to compete with them,
                    and here is something interesting: not too many people want
                    them.  </p>

                <p> What do people want? Chuck Norris/etc. factoids, lolcats
                    and other captioned images, funny cat videos, parodies of
                    <i>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</i> (♥), photos of
                    attractive (or even not too attractive) men and women,
                    screencasts of games or other programs (including many open
                    source programs), photos of scenery, new and improved
                    recipes for preparing food (and of course - tasty food
                    itself), new, old or renovated jokes, and some interesting
                    tales and anecdotes from your life. And naturally -
                    programs that can scratch an itch - however small.
                </p>

                <p> Some people told me that my solver for Freecell and other
                    solitaire games, simply called <a
                        href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell
                        Solver</a> is useless, but it's not - it's just a niche
                    program. And I received hundreds of E-mails about it.
                    Furthermore, given that Freecell is (or used to be) a big
                    phenomenon in Israel, where many boys and girls starting
                    from the age of 18 found themselves playing it on the <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces">Israeli
                        military</a> computers out of boredom, then the fact
                    that I have written a solver for it, has impressed many
                    people I talked with or met, including some attractive
                    (both physically and intellectually) young ladies.
                    They ended up asking me about how it was written, and which
                    algorithms it employed. </p>

                <p> So Freecell Solver was one of my most successful programs,
                    not despite being a niche program, but because of it. Niche
                    programs own. Not only that, but niche everything is great.
                    Many people whom I referred to <a
                        href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/">my
                        stories</a> helped themselves to the screenplay <a
                        href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">Star
                        Trek: “We, the Living Dead”</a> <b>because</b> it
                    contained Star Trek in the name, and because there are
                    quite a few fans of the <i>Star Trek</i> franchise and
                    worlds.  </p>

                <p> The more of a niche artwork you write, the more a large
                    subset of those who like it, are likely to pay attention to
                    it, try it out, and enjoy it.  For more information, see
                    Eric Sink’s excellent and inspiring essay <a
                        href="http://www.ericsink.com/articles/Buzz.html">“How
                        to get people talking about your product”</a>.  For
                    example, <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo">DuckDuckGo</a>
                    was originally marketed as a search engine by Perl geeks,
                    and for Perl geeks. It was a good marketing decision
                    because the Perl community is small, cohesive and is at a
                    good strategical position to influence other communities.
                    Right now, many people who are not Perl programmers, are
                    using it, as well as, or even in preference to Google, but
                    choosing Perl was a good preliminary strategical
                    decision.  We can
                    expect that with the future growth of DuckDuckGo, that it
                    will use more performant technologies than Perl more and
                    more, but it will still owe some of its initial success to
                    starting out as a Perl product.  </p>

                <p> I don’t remember whose idea it was, but we ended up
                    enrolling Eve into the Homecoming Queen contest. When Eve
                    discovered she was on the nominees list, she was a bit
                    upset.  </p>

                <p> “Homecoming Queen? Me? Why would I ever want to be a
                    homecoming queen?” </p>

                <p> “Eve, we thought you could see how beautiful you are, and
                    how much people could like you, if they got to know you.” I
                    answered.  </p>

                <p> “Hah! Well… oh heck, I don’t have a ready reply. But I’m
                    going to get you guys for this. I really will.” and she
                    started to walk from there. “You’ll see.” </p>

                <p> Eve showed up to the homecoming queen nominees roundup,
                    wearing one of her best dresses. When her turn came, she
                    began her speech: </p>

                <p> “Ladies and Gentlemen. I don’t know how many of you know
                    me, but my name is Eve Siegel. I urge you to vote for me
                    for homecoming queen, not for your sake, but for mine. I
                    really need you to vote for me, because my entire future
                    depends on it. Seriously.” </p>

                <p> “Take a look at my Résumé, for example. ‘Experienced in
                    computers and programming since 1994.’ ; ‘Experienced in
                    Linux and UNIX technologies since 1998’ ; ‘2000-2005 -
                    Debian Packager’, ‘2005-Present - Mandrake Packager’, and
                    more of this vain. Tell me, who will take a second look at
                    this C.V. if it did not say, ‘2005 - Elected as a
                    homecoming queen.’?” </p>

                <p> “Now for what I’m going to do if I’m elected. I’m going to
                    erect a gigantic statue of Tux the Penguin, this guy
                    [picture showing on the screen], and also one for Beastie
                    the BSD Daemon, [picture showing] for good measure. I’m
                    going to fight against abusive behaviour toward nerds and
                    geeks, for computer literacy, and… for world peace. What
                    the heck!” </p>

                <p> “But all these philanthropical causes are secondary to my
                    egoistical motives of having to win this title for my own
                    good. Thank you!” </p>

                <p> She practically brought down the house with this speech.
                    Even Taylor and I could not resist a maniacal laughter. She
                    ended up being one of the five finalists. As the elections
                    were on, Eve started her own campaign sloganed “Don’t vote
                    for Eve!” and gave away pamphlets with nothing but raves
                    about the other four contestants. This also increased her
                    karma considerably.  </p>

                <p> She wore the same dress during the homecoming queen
                    ceremony, as during the pre-election. As the runner-ups
                    were announced, she was given warm hugs from all-of-them.
                    She ended up being the first runner-up with a margin of
                    only 5 votes to the real winner. She ended up saying she
                    was glad she did not take the title, but I never saw her
                    happier than on that day.  </p>

                <p> She did not put it in her résumé.  </p>

                    intoxicating. Three guys hit on me at school since the
                    weekend, including this really cute Football player.” she
                    said.  </p>

                <p> “Hmmm… ” I said.  </p>

                <p> “Are you ladies alright?” the shop’s clerk (Tim, a young
                    and handsome man) approached us.  </p>

                <p> “Hey Tim!” I said, “I don’t believe you know my friend Eve
                    here.” </p>

                <p> “Eve Siegel!” she said and extended her hand.  </p>

                <p> “Tim O’Brian.” he said and they shook hands. “OK, I’ll be
                    there if you need me…” </p>

                <p> Eve followed him with her gaze for a few seconds, and then
                    smiled and went back to looking at the clothes.  </p>

                <p> “Will you stop that?” I whispered to her.  </p>

                <p> “Stop what?” she said.  </p>

                <p> “You’re totally into him.” </p>

                <p> “So I’m lusting him a little bit, so what? ‘But I say unto
                    you, that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her,
                    hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.’”
                </p>

                <p> “Well, girlfriend, committing adultery in your heart is
                    perfectly harmless and quite rewarding. And I’m not really
                    raping anyone. I’m tenderly making love to them.” </p>

                <p> “Listen,” I snapped at her, “Taylor is my best friend, and
                    I swear that if you…” </p>

                <p> “I’m crazy about Taylor.” she interrupted me.  </p>

                <p> “What?” I said.  </p>

                <p> She changed her pose. “I’m crazy about Taylor. Always have
                    been. I promise I wouldn’t do anything to hurt him.” </p>

                <p> “You always have been crazy about Taylor? Why didn’t you
                    tell him that?” </p>

                <p> “Come on, have you looked at me then? I wasn’t his type. He
                    always dated these well-groomed girls, who had some sense
                    not to rebel like I did. Hell, he also dated this
                    incredibly dumb cheerleader once.” </p>

                <p> “Stacie wasn’t dumb!” </p>

                <p> “I was being sarcastic! My point is that he was way out of
                    my league.” </p>

                <p> “Oh!” I said and tried to hug her.  </p>

                <p> “No hug!” she said. “In any case, I’ll do my best to make
                    things work between Taylor and I. And even if they don’t,
                    we’ll remain good friends. The kind of friends who go to
                    movies together, or socialise at LUG meetings, fix dates
                    for each other, etc.” </p>

                <p> “Good, I’m glad to hear that. Now where were we?” </p>

                <p> “Picking clothes.” she said, and after a while added: “You
                    know, we should drop by Radio Shack and get some dolls of
                    Tux and Beastie the BSD Daemon. I totally dig these guys.
                    Oh! And a nice Looney Toons poster. I’d hate to pump money
                    into the MPAA’s lawsuit machine, but I really like Marvin
                    the Martian.” </p>

                <p> “Who are you, and what have you done to Erisa?” </p>

                <p> “Hey, the makeover was your idea, Jennifer. What have
                    <strong>you</strong> done to Erisa?” and we both laughed.
                </p>

                <p> “Hi Taylor!” we said one after the other.  </p>

                <p> “Hey guys, ” he said, “what are you guys doing here?” </p>

                <p> “Helping Erisa get ready for her date.” I said.  </p>

                <p> “I’ll get her.” Amanda said, and went up the stairs.  </p>

                <p> “Don’t you think you look a bit plain for the date?” I
                    asked.  </p>

                <p> “Well, it’s only a movie and a pizza. Plus, there’s no way
                    on Earth that Erisa is going to look better than I am.”
                </p>

                <p> “Holy virgin mother of god!” exclaimed Jeff. He was looking
                    at the staircase where Erisa stood, descending it slowly.
                    Her jet-black hair was arranged in a ball and a pony tail,
                    shining from the light.  Her dark purple dress made her
                    look especially beautiful, and complimented her body. She
                    looked wonderful.  </p>

                <p> “So, ” she said after she reached the ground floor, shaking
                    her body and extending her hands, “how do I look?” </p>

                <p> “You look… ” Taylor said, “divine!” </p>

                <p> Erisa thought for a moment and then said: “‘Divine’s good.”
                </p>

                <p> “Here, Erisa…” </p>

                <p> “Hey, ‘Erisa’ was the old (and temporary) me. Call me ‘Eve’
                    now.” </p>

                <p> “…Eve! Here - I brought you flowers.” and he handed her the
                    flowers he had.  </p>

                <p> Eve (!) smelled them, and said, “they smell nice. Mum, can
                    you put them in a vase with some water?” </p>

                <p> “Ahhmm… Eve, can we stop by my house and give me a chance
                    to pick up some better clothes?” </p>

                <p> “Why?” Eve said, “we’re going to miss the movie.” </p>

                <p> “Well, people will look at the two of us and say: ‘she is
                    <strong>way</strong> out of his league!’” </p>

                <p> Eve approached Taylor. “Well, to quote Richard P. Feynman,
                    ” she said as she tied her arms around his neck “‘What do
                    you care what other people think?’ We both know you’re a
                    great guy and I’m so lucky to go on a date with you.
                    Mwaaa…” and she kissed him on the cheek.  </p>

                <p> “Well, ” he said, “I guess we’d better get going. Bye all!”
                </p>

                <p> “Bye!” we all said. Eve and Taylor left and Taylor gave us
                    a thumb’s up as he left, and we gave him back.  </p>

<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: hi.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: what&#39;s your name? ;-)</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">rindolf: i met you a couple of times in #programming years ago</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: ah, I vaguely remember it and can also grep my logs.</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">what brought you to ##english channel anyway?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: you&#39;re welcome .</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: I&#39;m here on autojoin, but often just lurking.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: thing is - I cannot sleep yet today - too many high thoughts.</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">rindolf: I see</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: do you mind if I share these thoughts with you?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: here on the channel?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And he left.</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">rindolf: i don&#39;t mind</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: I have a short essay (maybe a Google+ post) called &quot;Play to lose&quot;</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">When did you write it?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: where I say that you can learn more from a match/fight/argument/etc. that you lose than one that you won.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: I didn&#39;t write it yet.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: but i&#39;d like to - sorry for being unclear.</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">okay</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">please continue</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: thing is - it was believed that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee is the best combat fighter in history, and Chuck Norris is the second best one.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: now at the moment Norris is losing quite a few fights, but part of it is due to him being past his prime and with a malfunctioning left leg.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: but my pet theory is that many of the new age fighters could have beaten both Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee (who has since passed away unfortunately) in their prime, at least some of the time.</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">Okay</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: and it&#39;s also possible that in this day and age if we take Joe and Martin who are two superb mixed martial artists (MMAs) then it&#39;s possible that sometimes Joe will win and sometimes Martin.</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">Yeah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: moreover, the ancient Hebrew word for fighting or warfare has other more positive connotations : Bread (Lechem), soldering (Lehalchim - as in electronics), etc.</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">Well, that&#39;s very interesting</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: the root Ch.R.b/bh is reserved for destruction and a sword is called &quot;Cherev&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">Hehe</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: maybe it&#39;s similar to the greek mythology conception of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena as noble and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares as violent and destructive.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: my point is that there are many other ways to fight aside from combat.</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">okay</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: and the fighting I&#39;m really good at is at writing essays, stories, humour, etc. (which also convey serious messages in hopefully amusing ways).</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">i see</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: anyway, I decided that I encourage people to tell me why they think my stories sucked.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">So I can improve in the future.</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">you should go about writing it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Emma-Watson-applying-for-a-software-dev-job/ - someone told me he didn&#39;t like that, and after I asked him for the specifics, gave me a detailed analysis, and I realised he was right and improved it.</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">i&#39;m glad to hear that</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Part of the original problem there was that Emma Watson expressed herself in a manner that is unfit for an educated and intellectual Britishwoman who, on top of it, has graduated from English Literature from Brown University (which is a prestigious school.).</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: Yaakov on #perl said that he forgot how to speak English properly, because he doesn&#39;t know which words are common and which are not.</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">rindolf: what&#39;s his native language?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I have a huge problem with English vocabulary, but maybe it&#39;s actually better for non-native speakers of English (Which still sometimes ask me for clarification or &quot;What that words means?&quot;).</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: I think it&#39;s English. He&#39;s an American religious Jew.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: I&#39;m an Israeli secular Jew.</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">rindolf: I see</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whatsyourname: I think I&#39;ll just prepare a fortune cookie out of this conversation and call it a day.</saying>
<saying who="whatsyourname">Sure</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I&#39;m too lazy to write a proper essay and people may equally appreciate reading an IRC log.</saying>
<saying who="Somelauw">rindolf: Just looking a bit at your essay. &quot;but we decided to give you a chance anyway&quot;. Here you miss the opportunity to come up with a good humorous motivation to interview her.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Somelauw: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Somelauw: well, I don&#39;t feel strongly about it.</saying>

Becky and Chankey are sitting in the library, studying together, and
listening to <ulink url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpZddsmoEsI">Cimorelli
- “When I’m gone”</ulink> . Faith approaches them.

Hmm... hi kids! That doesn’t sound exactly like Anna Kendrick.

Whoa, who are all those girls?

Oh, they are Cimorelli - six sisters who sing together. They are
a big hit on YouTube.

Six sisters!

Heh, God bless their mother. After my third pregnancy (to twins) I
said: “That’s it. No way, José!”.

<para>
I would think their being a big family is part of their charm.

</para>

</saying>

<saying character="Chankey">

<para>
Yes, and the way I see it: all the power to them. See: I read
<ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea">20,000
Leagues Under the Sea</ulink> as a child, and I ended up memorising the English
translation and now the French original, because I liked it so much.

</para>

<para>
Anyway, Captain Nemo there, thinks he’s a nobody, which is what “Nemo”
means in Latin, but he's not. Thing is: lots of people expressed interest
in him due to his various unique qualities, and he kept thinking: “They are
interested in tangential stuff, not in the real me. They don't know the
real me.”

</para>

<para>
And here's the thing: all these qualities are what make you who you
are, and you should exploit them and be yourself.

</para>

<saying character="Faith">

<para>
Indeed!

                <p>while some people seem to have better talent for some things
                    from an early age (or what you call &quot;age&quot;), many
                    great artists worked hard to acquire it. Furthermore, hard
                    work can and should be a lot of fun, and it&#39;s important
                    to also &quot;Have a life&quot; and eat&amp;drink well
                    (&quot;Wine&quot;), enjoy the company of people of any sex
                    (&quot;Women&quot;) and have clean , creative, recreational
                    fun, however amateuristic or lame (&quot;Song&quot;).</p>

                <p>I&#39;ve started writing about all that in <a
                        href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/">an
                        essay</a> on my site which I called “Putting All Cards
                    on the Table (2013)” and now I wish to combine it, with
                    some newer and older insights into “Putting Many Cards on
                    the Table (2015)” which will likely need to be updated in
                    upcoming years as well.</p>

                <p>Like the old (and wise) adage goes: “The best time to plant
                    a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time to plant a
                    tree is now”. What it implies in this context is that the
                    earlier you start honing a skill, the sooner you will
                    become better at it.</p>

                <p>Anyway, what I suggest you do is go outside and socialise
                    more: talk to people with dogs (&quot;Hi! Nice dog! How is
                    he called? How old is he? What kind of dog is it?
                    What&#39;s <strong>your</strong> name? What do you
                    do?&quot;) , interesting shirts, tattoos, etc. Also - make
                    sure to talk to shop clerks, shop vendors,
                    waiters/waitresses, barmen, baristas, etc..</p>

                <p>One thing I learned from <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_%28film%29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_%28film%29</a>
                    is that &quot;Everyone can cook&quot;, or do most other
                    stuff that was shown to be possible. Furthermore, contrary
                    to popular belief (action) heroism is about bending the
                    rules, and finding you own unique, resourceful and
                    ingenius, &quot;hacky&quot; way to do things like David
                    used a sling to shoot goliath instead of using a spear to
                    fight him and most likely dying. My essay has <a
                        href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#david_and_goliath">a
                        section</a> about why David was an action hero and a
                    &quot;hacker&quot;, in a broad definition of the word.</p>

                <p>Another advice I can give you is to accept the fact that
                    you&#39;re depressed and be content. It&#39;s OK to be
                    depressed, like this episode of Simsons illustrates: <a
                        href="http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Moaning_Lisa">http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Moaning_Lisa</a>
                    . Also, one of the the best ways to be happy is to be
                    content with what you have and who you are and accept and
                    love yourself. &quot;He who has more is not happier than he
                    who is content with less.&quot;.</p>

                <p>Finally, I&#39;ve recently been tweeting a lot (see my feed
                    at <a
                        href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/with_replies">https://twitter.com/shlomif/with_replies</a>
                    ) about <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_%28biology%29">Darwinian
                        Fitness</a> which I believe is manifested in humans in
                    (sexual) attractiveness, a.k.a: &quot;hot&quot;ness (which
                    is not the same as beauty and I believe is more important),
                    and which has a very good and positive correlation with
                    competence a.k.a what Marx referred to as &quot;able&quot;
                    in his <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability%2C_to_each_according_to_his_need">“From
                        each according to his ability, to each according to his
                        need”</a> slogan.</p>

                <p>Now, this fitness/attractiveness is not the same as the
                    so-called <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness">Physical

                    competitor on a good day.”, and that&#39;s because they are
                    more (biologically) fit. Moreover, in British slang
                    &quot;fit&quot; came to mean a sexually desirable MOTAS
                    regardless of how athletic he or she is.</p>

                <p>If you still want to lose weight then I suggest following my
                    variation on Maimonides&#39; advice for dieting.
                    Namely:</p>

                <ol>

                    <li>Eat well, and eat what you feel like and want
                            to.</li>

                    <li>Don&#39;t eat in haste - eat in comfort and enjoy
                            your meal.</li>

                    <li>Eat according to the stomach - not according to the
                            eye.</li>

                    <li>Eat until you&#39;re 75% full - not until you&#39;re
                            100% full (and can&#39;t eat another
                            bite).</li>

                    <li>A bit minor, but my father kept eating food along
                            with extra bread, so he&#39;ll feel more full, but
                            I think it has an adversary effect.</li>

                </ol>

                <p>Finally, there was <a
                        href="http://science.slashdot.org/story/09/12/06/2228210/how-men-and-women-badly-estimate-their-own-intelligence">this
                        Slashdot feature</a> which claimed that most men and
                    women claimed that their male relatives were more
                    intelligent than their female ones, and I believed the
                    problem is that men and boys tend to be more
                    <strong>confident</strong> than women and girls (or used to
                    at least), and that implies taking more chances, being more
                    sloppy, allowing yourself to make mistakes, and accepting
                    the fact that some people will dislike you. After a while,
                    I saw this music video by Christina Grimmie which has the
                    very same theme, and this pet theory of mine was
                    reinforced: <a

<saying who="rindolf">misspwn_: so you're a girl who uses the term &quot;Feminazi&quot;? I tend to say &quot;cynical feminism&quot; which is less ambiguous.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">misspwn_: how many waves were there?</saying>

<saying who="misspwn_">rindolf, i don&#39;t think your average stereotypical 3rd wave feminist truly appreciates what the previous women have accomplished for them</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Xena was an awfully feminist (and unrealistic and comical) heroine, but I can retrospectively say she was awesome.</saying>

<saying who="Delver">of course</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Lucy Lawless who played her: 1. Also had starred in some Oceanian porn films before doing Xena. 2. Cried in her wedding.</saying>
<saying who="misspwn_">and i&#39;m not oppressed when i make my boyfriend a sandwich either. i like to cook</saying>

<saying who="misspwn_">rindolf, you get as much you put in</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">misspwn_: recently https://twitter.com/BarRefaeli tweeted about the fact that she started cooking and her Tsculent (with chicken!) looked yumyum.</saying>
<saying who="misspwn_">if you only put just the tip in, someone is going to be disappointed</saying>

                    personal whims and quirks, and which they expect you to
                    remember and accommodate for, all the time.

                    I understood what Monads are for 5 minutes. Then I had to
                    let go of the understanding. It was too intense to be kept
                    inside my head.

                    that linux would never ever be a gaming platform i tried to
                    point out he was wrong, and it's actually doing OK, and
                    everyone looked at me like i'm crazy.</p>  </blockquote>

                <p> Some rules of thumb I tweeted about recently: </p>

                <ol>

                    <li> If someone tells you something is impossible and you
                        can't do it, it probably can be done.  </li>

                    <li> If someone tells you something will *surely* never
                        happen, it likely can happen.  </li>

                    <li> If someone tells you are an idiot and are definitely
                        wrong, then you probably uncovered an <a
                            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room">Elephant
                            in the Room</a> and are right. Also see <a
                            href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/">“Encourage
                            criticism and try to get offended”</a>.  </li>

                </ol>

                <p> In general, people who are sure of themselves are probably
                    wrong, as I am not even sure of the <a

                    Back when I was in the 9th grade, during a Physics lesson,
                    one of my classmates complained to the teacher that
                    something we were learning was too hard. So my teacher asked
                    her “Do you see people with picket baskets outside?”
                    and she answered no. And then he said “Well, then you
                    should know that life is no picnic!”.

<saying who="rindolf">TimToady: BTW, is the word &quot;creator&quot; in English reserved to divine creation (like Hebrew &quot;boré&quot;) or can it be a more mundane one (&quot;yotzer&quot;)?</saying>
<saying who="geekosaur">english has only the one</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">geekosaur: yes</saying>
<saying who="geekosaur">to the extent that there&#39;s a difference, &quot;create&quot; implies something new, &quot;make&quot; means following someone else&#39;s pattern. but not everyone uses them that way; it&#39;s a much looser distinction than in Hebrew</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">geekosaur: well, there is https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Creator</saying>
<saying who="geekosaur">yes, it varies. there&#39;s religious groups that can get snippy at times. they don&#39;t run the show</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">geekosaur: in Hebrew we have `assah for &quot;make&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">geekosaur: thanks! Seems like the FSF are being paranoid in this regard</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">I had the craziest idea</saying>
<saying who="paddy">sell all computers?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I&#39;m going to announce that if and when I ever accumulate at least 10 million USD / 10 million EUR / or 10 million ILS - whatever currency is worth more at the point in my PayPal account I&#39;ll make the entire individual cultural works residing at my site (at present) CC-by except for those that I consider private / personal or those that were not original text and copied from elsewhere. I may not be as rich as J. K. Rowling used to be (before</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">she donated most of her &gt; 1,000,000,000 USD to charity - good for her) but with good marketing I may be settled for life. And I&#39;ll set all my current (not future ones naturally) children free and enjoy the rip offs, parodies, YouTube productions and maybe even ARR Hollywood films with a credit "Based on the Story [ $NAME ] [ URL ] by Shlomi Fish https://www.shlomifish.org/" at the credits for the rest of my life</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">paddy: my computers are not worth a lot and they contain a small amount of passwords I wish to keep secret</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">AFAIK it can be Bill Gates donating the whole 10 million or a million 10 dollar donations</saying>
<saying who="jxself">Okay so it&#39;ll basically never happen then. :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I&#39;ll title the blog post &quot;Prolific writer sells his entire works portfolio for the whole world for a shitload of money&quot;</saying>

<saying who="bheron">rindolf: Donate 1 million to the GNUstep foundation I&#39;m about to form… help us dominate the world. ;)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: forget it</saying>
<saying who="bheron">LOL</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: waste of money</saying>
<saying who="bheron">:)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I may donate to the Free Software Foundation</saying>
<saying who="bheron">Hey man!!! World domination is a good thing. :)</saying>
<saying who="ggoes">fund the hurd!</saying>
<saying who="bheron">Once we control the world, all will be good... I promise. :D</saying>
<saying who="bheron">YIKES!  Hurd.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: you wont get it even with a milliard dollars</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: and I&#39;m not willing to donate a cent</saying>
<saying who="bheron">I know.  Hey, as long as it works for me  and others... I&#39;m happy.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: got to prioritize</saying>
<saying who="bheron">rindolf: And we were getting along so nicely last time! ;)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">btw my text here is CC-by-nc-sa for now</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: maybe twit https://twitter.com/Taylorswift13 - I think she is rich and she probably has a smart phone or more and I like many of her songs so she may be interested</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">don't know how much taxes I&#39;ll have to pay</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I think Israel is not as bad as Britain was when https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxman was written</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">nice song btw</saying>
<saying who="bheron">rindolf: Probably worse.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I like the Beatles too</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">bheron: anyway I&#39;ll pay all the taxes from however I got just to stay on the safe side</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">don't want any trouble</saying>
<saying who="bheron">rindolf: you forgot that Taylor Swift shares her last name with a cockamamie language produced by apple for people who are too fucking stupid to comprehend Objective-C. ;)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">health &gt;&gt;&gt; money</saying>
<saying who="bheron">I mean Objective-C is verbose and self documenting yet many people (who have the nerve to call themselves real programmers) can&#39;t handle it. ;)</saying>
<saying who="bheron">(hehe)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: great - ad hominem</saying>
<saying who="bheron">No...l</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: maybe she&#39;ll sue apple for trademark damages</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">and win</saying>
<saying who="bheron">I hope so.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: ask her</saying>
<saying who="bheron">you know... the swift guys wrote me about when GNUstep will support swift...</saying>
<saying who="bheron">I told them &quot;Once your language syntax and structure stops changing radically every release, we will support it...&quot;</saying>
<saying who="bheron">it hasn&#39;t freaking stopped yet. :)</saying>
<saying who="bheron">I once used it on a project for AMGEN.</saying>
<saying who="bheron">I had to literally rewrite the application EVERY TIME THEY RELEASED an update.</saying>
<saying who="bheron">It&#39;s actually not terribly hard to make it happen... there is a bit of code in the swift open source code which would allow it to happen.... it would be, maybe, about 2 weeks of work.</saying>
<saying who="bheron">rindolf: and you&#39;re right, it is an &quot;ad hominem&quot; attack with respect to what I said about certain programmers and Objective C... but the way I see it some people don&#39;t know assembly...  is it the fault of the language or are they simply too dim to get it?</saying>
<saying who="bheron">(most likely the latter)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: you need to charge more</saying>
<saying who="bheron">for?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: if it&#39;s swift pay me 100,000 USD / year</saying>
<saying who="bheron">Oh… well for that job with AMGEN I charged $85 USD/hour.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: peanuts</saying>
<saying who="bheron">which works out to about, estimating... 144,000?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: aren't you living in .us?</saying>
<saying who="bheron">Yes</saying>
<saying who="bheron">That&#39;s a decent living.</saying>
<saying who="bheron">better than decent.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">you can charge 300 USD / hour for swift</saying>
<saying who="bheron">Hah... I have never met a developer who made that much per hour in my life.</saying>
<saying who="bheron">rindolf: have you ever contracted in the US?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: prices send signals - https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/joel-on-software.html#joel-camels-rubber-duckies-11</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: I&#39;m sure there are</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: Bill Gates won&#39;t get out of bed for 300 USD/hour</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">as an example</saying>
<saying who="bheron">https://www.google.com/search?q=average+per+hour+income+of+developers&amp;oq=average+per+hour+income+of+developers&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33.9671j1j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: think big</saying>
<saying who="bheron">Heh.</saying>
<saying who="bheron">Think myself out of every contract I could get. ;)</saying>
<saying who="bheron">the only way I&#39;ll make that is if I make my own apps... which I am trying to do.</saying>
<saying who="bheron">But you are correct on one thing... I need to think bigger.</saying>
<saying who="bheron">Because this contracting crap just isn&#39;t doing it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: in the book The Princess Bride a sword craftsman whose secret better craftsman was killed by the 6 fingered man charged more and more for his now pretty bad results and the more he charged the greater the demand was</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: have you read my link?</saying>
<saying who="bheron">Yes.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I&#39;m pretty sure Taylor Swift's time is worth more than 300 USD/hour</saying>
<saying who="bheron">It doesn&#39;t justify charging 185% over the national average when I&#39;m already on the top end of the bell curve.</saying>
<saying who="bheron">That&#39;s called &quot;Pricing yourself out of a job&quot;</saying>
<saying who="bheron">I get what you&#39;re saying, I simply disagree.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">if you offer her 900 USD for a three hour concert she won't bother replying</saying>
<saying who="bheron">I&#39;ve known developers who charged 100 per hour.... when the company needed to downsize, those guys were the first to go.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: ah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">bheron: why do you need donations anyway?</saying>
<saying who="bheron">The lesson is... keep your prices reasonable.  A little painful, but not too hard to swallow. :)</saying>
<saying who="jmd">$100 per hour is not a over the average these days.</saying>
<saying who="bheron">rindolf: Joking. :)   I don&#39;t.   I have enough right now.</saying>
<saying who="bheron">jmd: read the link I posted... it is slightly above average.</saying>
<saying who="bheron">The AMGEN job was years ago... I won&#39;t say how much I&#39;m pulling in now.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">well, unless she&#39;ll really identify with your cause</saying>
<saying who="jmd">My company charges between 250 - 400 (but I don&#39;t get to see nearly that much)</saying>
<saying who="bheron">I wasn&#39;t the one who mentioned Taylor Swift. ;)</saying>
<saying who="jmd">bheron: That&#39;s something to do with infinite series expansion isn&#39;t it?</saying>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> many of my stories are <b>not</b> too <b>realistic</b>, and aim
to reflect a better and more idealistic reality than the one many people
would perceive.
This is in part because, I am <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/#rindolfism">an
idealist</a>, and plan to remain so (and my idealism is dynamic and constantly
changes), and wish that my words and deeds will carry reality <b>forward</b>
instead of preserving the status quo.

<saying who="rindolf">Alex8532: hi, i&#39;m not too much into design patterns</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">CommunistWolf: why?</saying>

<saying who="Alex8532">Just joking, just joking.</saying>
<saying who="Alex8532">I love you</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">you can say &quot;hey guys&quot; to a group that includes females (also possibly exclusively) too</saying>
<saying who="CommunistWolf">I feel excluded by the term, and have a penis. such is life</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Alex8532: today I wasted some time debugging the wrong build stage, so i added some intelligence to my build process: https://github.com/shlomif/App-gimpgitbuild/commits/master ; https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=joel-remarkable-customer-service-3</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">refactoring and optimising code seem like bottomless pits (or evertop mountains?)</saying>
<saying who="warweasle">rindolf: I found a similar problem with retopologizing meshes.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">warweasle: with respect to refactoring?</saying>
<saying who="warweasle">Although I deal with lower poly stuff so it&#39;s not nearly as bad as people who use the subsurf modifier all the time.</saying>
<saying who="warweasle">rindolf: Very similar. You can just keep making it &quot;better&quot; when the original crappy mesh was good &quot;enough&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">warweasle: ah</saying>
<saying who="warweasle">rindolf: It really kills me because I do both modeling AND code.</saying>
<saying who="warweasle">If I looked, I could probably find a better paying job doing gamedev...but I enjoy doing next to nothing.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">warweasle: I recently ran into some cases where I spent many hours trying to fix functional defects, and then converted to a more elegant design, which ended up fixing the bugs later.</saying>
<saying who="warweasle">rindolf: Then that&#39;s the good kind of refactoring. But I go too far sometimes. I just keep trying to make it better because it&#39;s not &quot;perfect&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="warweasle">And honestly sometimes it&#39;s easier to rewrite something than fix it in place.</saying>

<saying who="k_sze">You know how, for numbers expressed in base 10, there is a way to check whether an integer is divisible by 3 or 9 by recursively summing the digits? Is there a pattern to this trick that extends to other bases? Are there special requirements for this kind of trick to hold for a certain base?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">k_sze: i think it is (b-1)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">k_sze: you can also use a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">k_sze: which works for any number base and modulo</saying>
<saying who="int-e">rindolf: right, 10_b = 1_b (mod b-1)</saying>
<saying who="k_sze">rindolf, 3 is not b-1 for base 10, so why does it hold?</saying>

<saying who="k_sze">interesting. So for base 16, I could check the divisibility of 15, 3, and 5 using this trick?</saying>

<saying who="int-e">rindolf: It&#39;s not stopping people from doing that though: https://github.com/olligobber/DivisibilityRegex</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Hi all! I noticed many Hollywood marriages and other relationships have been stable ever since https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar (♥!) was interviewed on &quot;why my hollywood marriage works?&quot;. I&#39;m not against divorces / breakups, but I want couples to be happy even if I&#39;m attracted to their female partner (and frankly I&#39;m attracted to a metric ton of celebs, friends, and fictional characters - 😊)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Also someone here wondered why https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna hasn&#39;t starred in a film for years now and wondered if &quot;she forgot how to act&quot;. Well, I doubt that you can forget that (if that&#39;s a thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERy-99vXxnM ; https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence never took acting lessons and won the oscar at age 22), I just think hollywood producers are scared shitless of her: https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/my-real-person-fan-fiction/ .</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">there is https://www.peppercarrot.com/en/article465/episode-32-the-battlefield too (also see the Midrash in the blog comments.)</saying>

<saying who="hemkunskapz">yea some acting skills are probably needed</saying>
<saying who="hemkunskapz">otherwise it&#39;s cameos</saying>
<saying who="hemkunskapz">but a lot of movies have bad acting too :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">hemkunskapz: BTW: if this was a real film (after some possible revamp) - https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/ - i bet thousands of &quot;geeks&quot; would love to see it. ok, i either need to rework the screenplay into the blessed hollywood format or some director needs to take the effort to clear their prejudice and read it as it is: http://paulgraham.com/gba.html (the word &quot;hacker&quot;). being a hero implies &quot;hacking&quot; as the ages old &quot;David vs. Goliath&quot; myth indicates: https://github.com/shlomif/missile-vs-melee-take-three</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">hemkunskapz: when i was in the psychiatric ward, a fellow patient (who seemed fairly sane and rational and informed) told me there is a genuine shortage of &#39;original&#39; screenplays in .il. But even my &quot;humanity&quot; screenplay ( https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/humanity/ - cc-by-sa ) is based on the Jewish Bible and history lessons. Now imagine how films will flourish if they allowed fanfics and crossovers of proprietary franchises</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">hemkunskapz: re acting skills, sharon stone ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Stone ) acted fairly badly in many of her earlier films, but they were still successful (and i enjoyed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quick_and_the_Dead_(1995_film) immensely) and i find the bad acting in last action hero&#39; s hamlet scene and most of Mel Brooks&#39; films a feature - not a bug</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">For the record: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Eont_yEGZs</saying>
<saying who="hemkunskapz">rindolf: i&#39;ve heard that too, shortage of screenplays</saying>
<saying who="hemkunskapz">hence remakes etc</saying>
<saying who="hemkunskapz">it may even be hard to find any old book that hasn&#39;t been adapted</saying>
<saying who="hemkunskapz">crossovers is a matter of copyrights i believe</saying>
<saying who="hemkunskapz">if that can be negotiated, no problem</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">hemkunskapz: yes</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">hemkunskapz: there was https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_vs._Predator_%28film%29</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">hemkunskapz: i released all of my franchises under cc-by: https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/copyrights/#characters_concepts_plots_and_worlds - but it&#39;s a drop in the ocean</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">and you often need to get clearance for parent franchises</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">hemkunskapz: here i broke the unwritten rule of doing star trek+starwars crossovers: https://github.com/shlomif/missile-vs-melee-take-three - it gave me an idea for a franchise crossing star wars Ep. I, Star Trek TNG/DS9, and current real-world/online life with Tiffany Alvord as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala ; My Little Pony&#39;s Fluttershy as her internal thought process ; and the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne%27s_World_(film) duo as the plot commentors and manipulators. I never said I was sane. (and normal people aren&#39;t fun)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I think I&#39;m going to try https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Con_Man_(web_series) next - giving it 3 episodes. I think stars/creators stardom and fandom are self-sustaining and invigorating.</saying>

You can never truly appreciate Hamlet until you've read it in the original

But all the mightiest Klingon warriors have watched

            <body>

            <p>
            ( <b>Caveat Emptor:</b> I am a <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/guy_or_girl.xhtml">straight and non-trans male</a>,
            so I may not know what I am talking about. Here be dragons. )
            </p>

            <p>
            Most men do not spend a lot of time and money on beauty products,
            even though <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-sharp-programming-men-about-problems-with-their-hair">they
            often have their share of frustrations with their hair</a>, and they look fine.
            As evidence, several heterosexual women who looked
            at <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/self-photos/">some of the photos
            people took of me</a>
            told me I looked handsome.
            </p>

            <p>
            Moreover, most underage girls look cute, lovely, and beautiful,
            despite not using makeup.
            </p>

            <p>
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Esther">Scroll of Esther</a> testifies
            that, during the time of the Persian empire (circa 470 BC), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Esther#Text_and_translations">a woman's makeup process took 12 months</a>,
            and these fictional women were blown out of the water
            by Hadassah (who became queen Esther), who was simply confident,
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FktDDKNrWjk">was being herself</a>,
            and doing it in <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/make-your-own-kind-of-music.xhtml">her own (imperfect and thus perfect) way</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
            So I suspect most beauty products are the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup">stone soup</a>
            (or placebo)
            effect for women: they instil confidence, but then can
            be avoided altogether for an even better, more
            natural, and more beautiful look.
            </p>

            <p>
            In my <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=mighty-boosh--ape-of-death">favourite sketch</a>
            of the British comedy troupe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mighty_Boosh">The Mighty Boosh</a>,
            the Ape of Death (a male) has suffered from
            hair problems even as a child, and then after
            six minutes of treatment says "Look at me. I'm
            so confident… and feel strong and supersexy!".
            </p>

            the female singer Sinead O'Connor looks great bald.
            Moreover, the bald actor
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Stewart">Patrick

I suspect the media coverage of the violence in Syria to be skewed. I think
most of Syria is peaceful most of the time and that both the Syrian government forces
and ISIL are harmless if not benevolent. I hope and expect Damascus to remain
the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, and to feel as Shalom-ful
as Tel Aviv or Beirut. Israel, the Hizbullah, the Syrian government, or ISIL will
accept money donations, but will gladly pay volunteers to do more than just be
web/social media bloggers (often parody ones).

<p>
Same for most other causes.

I wish to <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Queen-Padme-Tales/Queen-Padme-Tales--Planting-Trees.html">plant trees somewhere in Europe</a> with some old or new online friends.

I will be full internet attention whoring (but honest and non-pushy)
about my contributions: both given - and received. Yesterday I went outside,

<p>
With all due respect to #COVID, putting people (especially old) in detainment makes them psychologically and biologically worse and worse. A study once concluded that exposing mice to radiation harmed their immunity system. However, my father (a biologist) told me that a different study found that just moving a mouse through corridors in a building had the same bad effect on their immunity system even without exposing to radiation, due to causing stress and fright. Humans wish to go outside and do what they want ( "as you wish" / "make it so" / "carpe diem" ): <a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/">Saladin Style</a> .

<p>
NOTE: here is  <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/stress-immune.html#:~:text=When%20we're%20stressed%2C%20the,lowers%20the%20number%20of%20lymphocytes">a citation</a>
that my father found about the effect of stress on the immune system.
I also recall reading that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides">Maimonides</a> noted that a person's optimism influenced his recovery, and there may likely have been earlier sources.

The months i spent in the closed psychiatric ward for being "bipolar" and unable to leave were worse than my 6½ years in the Technion, and they would be even worse if I weren't so resourceful: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0KpseN9AjE">Highway to Hell</a> ; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIPl9o-SQRg">Wyclef Jean - Wish You Were Here</a>.

<p>
Despite common belief, the history and prehistory of planet Earth has been
rewritten several times by Ashmedai, the meta-Satan who created the 3d1t
"gods", a capacitanced reality which he endowed with many gifts of a blessing
and a curse, only to realise most of his curses were turned into blessings.
He has sworn to keep "backward compatibility" which was his mortal
nemesis.

<p>
It matters if you're a girl or a boy and who your parents were. Some people
have free will, some don't yet. He can hear some people's thoughts, and change
matter and binary bits. Some people are strong or beautiful from birth.
The reason why modern alpha females are not <b>that pretty</b> is because they
are the daughters of an Alpha Male (son-of-David) and a bland looking female,
who were crazily smart and had to work a little to look decent.
You need to use different strategy for different people based on what they say.

Mass production does not happen on Earth, because factory workers are
miserable, but the <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse">Q Continuum</a> has been shipping duplicated raw materials and products to Earth.

in Ramat Aviv Gimel and we'll emblaze the hard disk containing Ashmedai as a

<p>
Kira Nerys was actually a Vietnamese orphan who was adopted by a Bajoran man who
immigrated to Vietnam due to the Cardassian occupation of Bajor. He later relocated
to the USA when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War">the Vietnam War</a>
broke out, and Kira grew up there. At one point, she set up a multi-sessionned
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">RPGs</a>
event titled "Free Bajor" as a joke, which escalated the actual Bajoran struggle
for independence and ended the occupation.
</p>

<p>
Kira assigned her Terran friend, nicknamed "Dukat", as the pseudo- Cardassian
official in charge of the negotiations. As a result of all that, Dukat was
offered a position in the Cardassian government, while Kira became a national
Bajoran heroine and the legendary profile "The Gamer".
</p>

<p>
As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Joan_Hart">Melissa Joan Hart</a>
(= "MJH"; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarissa_Explains_It_All">Clarissa</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_the_Teenage_Witch_(1996_TV_series)">Sabrina</a> )
was an old colleague of Dukat and he somewhat romanticised their friendship,
she became <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ambassador">a UFP ambassador:</a>
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[ Odo approaches an acrobatics overseer on <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Deep_Space_9">DS9</a> ]
</p>

<p>
<b>Odo:</b> Hi! May I speak to Ambassador Hart, please?
</p>

<p>
<b>Overseer:</b> to whom?
</p>

<p>
<b>Odo:</b> [sighs] to Melissa Joan Hart?
</p>

<p>
<b>Overseer:</b> oh… [he whistles] Mel!
</p>

<p>
[ MJH arrives sweaty and out of breath. ]
</p>

<p>
<b>MJH:</b> hello Mr. Odo…
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
( An actual dialogue. )
</p>

<p>
Anyway, Dukat also was a popular Rock / Hard Rock / Metal / $loud-music-genre
musician who had a series of concerts titled "Gul Dukat Live at Bajor"
which were performed there. The front rows were populated by "Bajorans"
on one side and "Cardassians" on the other (who were not necessarily citizens,
residents, etc. of either planet). Moreover, during the climax of the show, they
started throwing Terran tomatoes at one another.
</p>

<p>
Dukat thinks this has great <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/money_cant_buy_you_love.xhtml">positive energies</a>, and these shows featured collabs with diverse artists from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica">Metallica</a> and
<a href="https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Animal">Animal</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele">Adele</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Alvord">Tiffany Alvord</a>.
These concerts have been very profitable, despite the fact that he had to
comply with some regulations as a Cardassian politician.

<saying who="CrystalMath">i&#39;m 100% with Andrew Lee and the new management, if that wasn&#39;t obvious from my messages everywhere yesterday</saying>
<saying who="AliciaC">I don&#39;t have much of an opinion about Andrew Lee. Libera is kind of just &quot;same old Freenode&quot;, which I know to be good</saying>

<saying who="CrystalMath">AliciaC: libera is the same old freenode which i know to be bad, and which i wanted to leave; and now&#39;s my chance</saying>

<saying who="sobukus">CrystalMath: &quot;those people signed …&quot;, you know how many of those? I wonder if there is a clear connection or just an intersection of opinions on RMS and freenode governance in some of them, not necessarily related.</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">sobukus: 5 of them</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">but like, when i look at the libera staff, it&#39;s basically just 2 of these and nobody else; and of the people hanging around it&#39;s another one of these</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">Aaron Jones is the only one with libera/staff/*</saying>
<saying who="sobukus">to clarify, you say that 2 of the signers are part of libera staff, among other people? Or that there are no other people?</saying>
<saying who="sobukus">It&#39;s really hard to get an informed opinion when not being really inside the circles.</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">sobukus: 5 of ex-freenode staff are signers; but i only find 2 of these to be libera staff (that can&#39;t be right but i can&#39;t find any more at all)</saying>
<saying who="dragestil">Read that pdf, I still don&#39;t believe lee&#39;s side of the story</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">sobukus: and i mean i can&#39;t find more than 2 libera staff members</saying>
<saying who="dragestil">the way he presents things just reeks of bullshit and selectiveness</saying>
<saying who="sobukus">I&#39;ve read the PDF… also the chat logs adriane published (not sure if that&#39;s a decent act … same as the private chats Lee published).</saying>
<saying who="sobukus">It&#39;s murky for me.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">CrystalMath: i hope freenode becomes popular among people who love their work (neoamateurs/&#39;geeks&#39;): https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Emma-Watson-applying-for-a-software-dev-job/#reception - ¨I think we would hire Emma Watson based on looks alone. 🙂" — glange on Freenode’s #objectivism.</saying>
<saying who="dragestil">and he did not address former staff&#39;s claim about christel did not clarify the former staff about the deal</saying>
<saying who="dragestil">...before resigning</saying>
<saying who="dragestil">...so that the former staff did not know what was sold to lee</saying>
<saying who="sobukus">I guess the most interesting stuff happened before 2021.</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">dragestil: personally, if this is going to be about who i *want* to control freenode; then it&#39;s definitely not the old freenode staff</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">there&#39;s numerous reasons to stay away from those people, and therefore OFTC and libera</saying>
<saying who="dragestil">and lee&#39;s promise about not taking operational control</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">dragestil: the thing is, the old freenode staff were *not* good people, they were extremely authoritarian</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">and also used other methods to harass users of the network</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">whose political opinions did not align with theirs</saying>
<saying who="sobukus">Problem here is perhaps that the vast majority of users never had any contact with the staff.</saying>
<saying who="sobukus">So all we get is hearsay from both (or multiple) sides:-/</saying>
<saying who="dragestil">CrystalMath: I don&#39;t have anything new to say about your hatred towards former freenode staff</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">yeah, that&#39;s why their evils are kept hidden, but kreyren at least is amassing all the proof against them</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">i really should have logged stuff :(</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">i should have prepared a nice package for the day that those people finally lose their power, so that they can be outed as the evil conniving group that they are</saying>
<saying who="bandali">let&#39;s stop with the name calling and talking behind people&#39;s back</saying>
<saying who="river">no</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">bandali: i&#39;m sorry, i&#39;ll wait for kreyren to gather the evidence</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">i&#39;m just a little frustrated that this could have been more obvious</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">and i&#39;m concerned about all the people who will leave because we didn&#39;t publish the evidence on time :(</saying>
<saying who="sobukus">Maybe you can help me clear up the sides of the battle (if not who is Right™ right now). I see tomaw is head of OFTC. OTFC and freenode split apart some time ago but also started to cooperate … to the point of tomaw also becoming head of freenode? Are those leaving for libera associated with OFTC, or the remaining freenode in  some way?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">CrystalMath: i welcome the old freenode staff back per Saladin&#39;s ethics: http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">rindolf: i wouldn&#39;t want them to be staff again, but sure they can join channels as regular users</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">sobukus: OFTC k-lines people who support RMS, so there&#39;s that</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">sobukus: but yes OFTC will maybe group with libera, not the new freenode</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">i would recommend avoiding oftc and libera</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">(but my evidence on tomaw is too slim to explain why, there&#39;s a bit of a hunch involved)</saying>
<saying who="sobukus">CrystalMath: So … we got 3 networks that are supposed to foster technical discussion about software projects, and which battle about politics. Two of them seem likely to build an alliance.</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">sobukus: maybe not though</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">i wouldn&#39;t call it likely</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">just possible, while the other is impossible</saying>
<saying who="sobukus">Heh, relatively likely, then;-)</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">i really haven&#39;t seen much libera staff there at all, just anti-RMS people like adfj and jose</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">(they are signatories of the letter)</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">and OFTC seems to be tomaw</saying>
<saying who="sobukus">There&#39;s so much unfortunate stuff going on.</saying>
<saying who="sobukus">People should be more able to disagree in a civilized manner.</saying>
<saying who="dragestil">https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libreplanet-se/2021-05/msg00005.html</saying>
<saying who="dragestil">Would be cool if Swedish digital currency uses gnu taler</saying>
<saying who="sobukus">Yeah, taler seems nice.</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">i prefer cash</saying>
<saying who="dragestil">Why, taler is anonymous for prayers</saying>
<saying who="sobukus">Sure, but as long as you have to go digital (like, bank transfers at all), Taler seemed OK to me.</saying>
<saying who="dragestil">payers</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">i mean, i will always avoid computers whenever i can</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">my priority is: no software &gt; free software &gt; non-commercial proprietary software</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">and the rest is not used</saying>
<saying who="sobukus">It should tell you something that when it comes to computer tech / software being in control of things, the people who know more about it tend to be more afraid of it. While normally, you are afraid of things you _don&#39;t_ know.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">CrystalMath: &lt;CrystalMath&gt; rindolf: i wouldn&#39;t want them to be staff again, but sure they can join channels as regular users ==&gt; yes,</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">rindolf: well some of them are still connected to freenode in fact, just not on nearly as many channels as before</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">we also should not rest on our laurels</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">CrystalMath: i talked w a girl w a dog in the park about my https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Terminator/Liberation/ongoing-text.html screenplay. she was friendly, looked great and had an oriental complexion, and her dog ended up liking me too,,</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">CrystalMath: i want to tweet about the freenode coup</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Sat 22 May 17:46:24 IDT 2021</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">rindolf: hmm?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">CrystalMath: BTW, for a while now : free/open/remix→more money: https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1378421699142635525 "Whether #TaylorSwift gets the rights for her old songs back or not, it wont change the fact that eventho theyre her brainchildren, they belong2 noone&amp;everyone (who can cover, remix them, &amp; listen to them). Neither tay nor her recordlabel will likely go bankrupt soon."</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">CrystalMath: i went on a walk w my dad and there is a dogs&#39; enclosure</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">CrystalMath: did you understand?</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">rindolf: hmm?</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">i&#39;m not familiar with the Taylor Swift song ownership thing</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">CrystalMath: ah, the contract with her old record label ended</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">CrystalMath: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=taylor+swift+contract&amp;atb=v140-1&amp;ia=web</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">rindolf: christel is also not bad, she was actually keeping the staff somewhat moderate; after she quit they were unhinged</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">err not rindolf, river ^</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">CrystalMath: ah</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">honestly, with libera you&#39;re not getting the old freenode, because it&#39;s missing christel, who was harassed and ousted this march</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">now, if she created a new network, that would be different</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">there was only one hostile takeover at freenode, and it happened this march, not now</saying>
<saying who="rbraun_">CrystalMath: it&#39;s also missing tomaw / oftc overlap though, so</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">rbraun_: but it has everyone else</saying>
<saying who="rbraun_">and most of them are okay, I don't know</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">also according to jess tomaw should be there...</saying>
<saying who="CrystalMath">i must have not done the command correctly</saying>

<p>
The "gods" in the <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse">Selinaverse</a> are any kind of <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/crossover-hypothesis-about-the-origin-of-consciousness/">leaders or guideline-generators</a> which a conscious organism's mind emits
their utterances as thoughts for guidance. Gods spawn imaginary realities
of one another using <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/#real_shlomif_success">self reference and circular "strange" loops</a>
by using <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/learning_more_from_inet_forums.xhtml">the gift of learning / pleasure / conception</a> (or "knowledge").
</p>

<p>
Now at one point during their history, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Bajoran">the Bajorans</a>
were introduced to the devices used to communicate with The Prophets, a race
of timeless aliens, who identified gods using superlatives such as
<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Emissary_of_the_Prophets">"The Emissary"</a>,
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/ongoing-text.html#kai-blanche">"The Invisible"</a>,
or
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/ongoing-text.html#the-master">"The Master"</a>. They started their millenia-long attempts to
correlate the titles with the actual entities. At first, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Bareil_Antos">Vedek Bareil</a>, one of
the first Vedeks, who is also known as "The Damage", placed a staff in
the ground and ordered all vedeks to never leave its vicinity.
This got tiresome, so several decades later, <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/ongoing-text.html#kai-blanche">Blanché</a>
broke the staff into two, announced that he is now a "Kai" and that
Vedeks can travel as far as they want. The Bajorans ended up burning both
parts of the staff to prevent them from becoming objects of worship.
</p>

<p>
The Bajorans actually worked better against The Prophets, than the rest of the
galaxy initially worked against The Bajorans, taking into account the fact that
there can be a different, say, "The Master" for a certain time and
locality.
</p>

<p>
Quark, a Ferengi, set up <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Quark%27s_Bar,_Grill,_Gaming_House_and_Holosuite_Arcade">his bar</a>
close to Bajor in order to profit from <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/indiv-nodes/kai-blanche.xhtml">"the industry around the Bajoran prophecies [which] is making millions"</a>.

<saying who="twb">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_is_a_Jew%3F  —  there are many answers, but MOST of the time it&#39;s not related to religion.</saying>
<saying who="twb">Interestingly, the right of return doesn&#39;t follow halakhic rules, and is much stricter for Ethiopians than, say, Russians.</saying>
<saying who="twb">Huh.  &quot;Argos&quot; sometimes means &quot;silver&quot;, BUT sometimes means &quot;not working&quot; (a- + ergos)</saying>
<saying who="twb">I feel an urgent need to accost people in Milton Keynes and explain this volubly.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">twb: &lt;joke&gt;re &quot;who is a Jew?&quot; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovadia_Yosef has the privilege of blessing everyone he pleases (and their maternal descendents) as a Jew, and he is yet to answer &quot;no&quot; to the question &quot;Is [insert entity here] a pure Jew?&quot;»</saying>
<saying who="twb">&quot;pure&quot; eyeroll</saying>
<saying who="twb">rindolf: I think I must be misreading you somehow, because it sounds like &quot;whenever asked &#39;is X a Jew?&#39; he always answers &#39;yes&#39;&quot; — which seems unlikely for an ultra-orthodox dude</saying>
<saying who="twb">Since someone&#39;s bound to have asked e.g. &quot;is Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer a Jew&quot; by now</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">it is believed he dressed in the extravagant custom from the same reason as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader who openly admitted he uses his robot custom because it is memorable</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">twb: it was a joke - take it easy. and in that joke world, he answered &quot;yes&quot; to that question. there are also several sects of superintelligent Jewish cats there. &lt;/joke&gt;</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">twb: have you watched https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_Panda_2 ? i like how Po forgives the villain at the end</saying>
<saying who="twb">rindolf: schools often take a dim view of old men being friends with high school students</saying>

<saying who="StayHungry">good morning, comrades :)</saying>
<saying who="StayHungry">i wonder if there are any reputable sources left in English-speaking world which still adhere that singular they is... a controversial thing?</saying>
<saying who="StayHungry">I relied upon Chicago manual of style in this matter, but it seems they too gave up</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">StayHungry: i used singular &quot;they&quot; in the past, but now use &quot;he&quot; again at times.</saying>
<saying who="ksft">it could *maybe* be considered nonstandard when referring to specific people of known (binary) gender</saying>
<saying who="ksft">but it&#39;s been used for centuries generically</saying>
<saying who="ksft">including by Shakespeare and in the King James Bible</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">KJV used it too, yes</saying>
<saying who="ksft">it&#39;s actually older than the singular &quot;you&quot;</saying>
<saying who="ksft">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/they#Usage_notes</saying>
<saying who="StayHungry">ksft: used does not mean common. for example, i use word &#39;invective&#39; on par with ancient ancestors, whereas it&#39;s not common in English.</saying>

<saying who="kompowiec">in my country we have inflection and i can use only &quot;he&quot; in sentence. I don&#39;t consider this to be a mistake.</saying>

<saying who="kompowiec">we have*</saying>
<saying who="kompowiec">polish</saying>
<saying who="kompowiec">I remember a funny situation where some idiot called my language sexist for that reason.</saying>
<saying who="ksft">StayHungry: I don&#39;t think I understand your point</saying>
<saying who="ksft">I meant that it&#39;s been standard usage for centuries</saying>
<saying who="kompowiec">just because you can change any word in English because there is no inflection, does not mean that in other languages it is possible.</saying>
<saying who="ksft">was that person an English speaker?</saying>
<saying who="twb">kompowiec: English has inflexion, just not for gender (mostly)</saying>
<saying who="StayHungry">also, i live both outside of golden billion and gender-whatever discourse, so that wikipedia article written by you know whom is not relevant. i&#39;m looking not for fashion advice, but for sources that still stick to what is make sense grammatically, not politically.</saying>
<saying who="ksft">if so, you could respond by pointing to words that are always gendered in English</saying>
<saying who="ksft">like &quot;niece&quot;/&quot;nephew&quot;</saying>
<saying who="kompowiec">he knew another language, but it was not a inflection language</saying>
<saying who="twb">kompowiec: pronouns still inflect for gender, as does the adjective &quot;blond/blonde&quot; and, historically, some jobs (e.g. &quot;invigilator/invigilatrix&quot;)</saying>
<saying who="ksft">some jobs still do</saying>
<saying who="kompowiec">negress :P</saying>
<saying who="ksft">&quot;waiter&quot;/&quot;waitress&quot;, &quot;actor&quot;/&quot;actress&quot;</saying>
<saying who="twb">ksft: depending on the dialect, yes</saying>
<saying who="ksft">the masculine one is also generic in all cases I can think of, though</saying>
<saying who="kompowiec">&gt; invigilatrix</saying>

<saying who="kompowiec">oo</saying>
<saying who="twb">kompowiec: &quot;doctress&quot; and &quot;actress&quot; and &quot;aviatrix&quot; are attested more commonly.</saying>
<saying who="ksft">&quot;proctor&quot;, in American English</saying>
<saying who="twb">Also &quot;danceuse&quot;</saying>
<saying who="kompowiec">that&#39;s what I was gonna say, it&#39;s from the British</saying>
<saying who="twb">ksft: well... &quot;proctress&quot; in that case ;-)</saying>
<saying who="ksft">what variant uses &quot;doctress&quot;?</saying>
<saying who="twb">ksft: none anymore, but it was readily apparent in the early 1900s</saying>
<saying who="kompowiec">I only know the American dialect, probably because of its ubiquitous presence.</saying>
<saying who="twb">kompowiec: I&#39;d have thought Poland more likely to use British due to proximity, but I guess all the rest of western europe is in between you</saying>
<saying who="ksft">I think mandatory gendering is unfortunate in languages, but it&#39;s ridiculous to suggest that people who use those languages are doing something wrong</saying>

<saying who="shlomif">10 MB is peanuts nowadays. </saying>
<saying who="twkm">still might fail though if the duration is automatic.</saying>
<saying who="pr-asadi">dave0: How did do static?</saying>
<saying who="dave0">pr-asadi: because twkm </saying>
<saying who="twkm">static duration was required.  the static keyword might not be needed, but that depends on context.</saying>
<saying who="Twix">usually it is not a good idea to put a 10 MB array on the stack. I think usually the stack on Linux is only 8 MB big(might be higher now, not sure what the current value is). So putting it into the static memory section might be good idea :&gt;</saying>
<saying who="Twix">but why do you not like to use malloc? I usually avoid malloc, too. But its because i usually work in microcontrollers</saying>
<saying who="pr-asadi">So... fgets function does not give char *array type.</saying>
<saying who="pr-asadi">does not takes*</saying>
<saying who="Twix">?</saying>
<saying who="pr-asadi">I should use narrow string(char array[length]).</saying>
<saying who="twkm">pointer into storage, at least n bytes of it where n is what you provide a the second argument.</saying>
<saying who="twkm">some prefer using allocated storage there, but automatic, static or thread local is fine too.</saying>
<saying who="pr-asadi">Twix: What do you mean? I am a beginner.</saying>
<saying who="Twix">that the stack size is limited? Or the static memory thing?</saying>
<saying who="pr-asadi">twkm: I should read more about the static keyword.</saying>
<saying who="Twix">there are basically 3 memory sections. Maybe 4 if you take thread local memory into account. The stack, the heap and the static memory</saying>
<saying who="twkm">indeed, storage duration and the meaning of the qualifiers should be learned.</saying>
<saying who="twkm">ugh.</saying>
<saying who="Twix">the static memory gets allocated by the compiler/linker. Its size is known at compile time / before the program has been started.</saying>
<me_is who="caveman">has quit (Quit: the ##end of the abyss)</me_is>
<saying who="Twix">every thing you declare as static never gets deleted. The memory is allocated due the whole program lifetime. E.g. if you have a static variable in a function, it will keep it content between calls of this function</saying>
<saying who="pr-asadi">Twix: Thanks man. I did know these things. I should read more.</saying>
<saying who="Twix">you did already know? :o</saying>
<saying who="Twix">on microcontrollers its neat to use static memory for everything. If you avoid malloc you can make better predictions about the memory consumption of your program</saying>
<saying who="Twix">but its more complicated to write a memory efficient program. You need to put a lot of thought how to use these static allocated memory to not waste it</saying>
<saying who="Twix">On a bigger system i would not recommend this technique and rather simply use malloc to get the buffer you need</saying>
<saying who="twkm">given char s[n]; or static char s[n]; or char *s = malloc(n); -- which you provide to fgets doesn&#39;t matter to fgets.</saying>
<saying who="pr-asadi">Twix: Sorry. &quot;I did not&quot; is true.</saying>

Most early home computers (e.g: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a>) suffered from the "Form over function" fallacy. I imagined a 1980s IBM PC clones commercial that featured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Joan_Hart">Melissa Joan Hart</a> as a child fixing PCs. Then the camera zoomed into her belt with the caption "It doesn't take a witch to fix this computer. All it takes is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_F._Phillips">Phillips Screwdriver</a>." This commercial helped cement the PCs' dominance.
</p>

<p>
Hart was kind-of pre-destined to become <b>The Witch</b> given
<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Winn_Adami">Vedek Winn</a>
predicted that their final name will be "Meli-Lisa Jo-Anne Heart"
based on the profile's previous names.

<saying who="systemfault">I don&#39;t know, my guess is simply because of how programming started.</saying>
<saying who="sig">maybe something to do with sequence points?</saying>
<saying who="sig">but it&#39;s such an &quot;obvious&quot; thing that you might always want to potentially have a value back from any kind of expression; and, like, why not? It can always be ignored if it&#39;s not needed</saying>
<saying who="sig">and I mean, new languages get designed all the time. Why does TypeScript have statements (ok, because js). Why does rust have statements?</saying>

<p>
After <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Gideon_Seyetik">Gideon Seyetik</a>
tried to commit suicide, he and Q materialised on the bridge of The Defiant, and
Q said:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What you did was brave, but not brave enough. See, the right to divorce is
upheld by the constitution of the Q Continuum and all other known continuums
as well as The-Codex™. I divorced <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/indiv-nodes/Qs-wife.xhtml">my share of wives</a> and
some organisms divorced after milliards of years of marriage.
</p>

<p>
Your wife's race's reluctance for separation is unlikely to be biological.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
So Prof. Seyetik and his wife started a political / religious struggle
to allow them and other unhappy couples to divorce. It was successful
eventually, but ironically Mrs. Seyetik was so impressed by her husband's
perseverence, that she fell in love with him again, and they remained
together.
</p>

<p>
Since then, the couple has been doing other political activism.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> this is <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/why_real_person_fiction.xhtml">Real Person Fiction</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is known that a man or a woman, of any age, can be physically strong,
staminous, dextrous, flexible, etc. while having small muscles and being
lightweight. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=julia+vins&amp;atb=v140-1&amp;ia=web">Julia Vins'</a>
natural DNA gave her a thin, skinny body which she disliked. This was despite
the fact that she ate a lot.
</p>

<p>
Given pregnancy was out of the question, and given she preferred not to
use magic for it yet, she turned to bodybuilding. However, she, preferred
to remain skinny while being happy, rather than gain muscle mass and
be miserable. As a result, Ms. Vins:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Ate many fatty or sweet foods. There's a video where
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#jennifer_lawrence">Jennifer Lawrence</a> and she
were recorded devouring a whole extra large pizza each.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Often skipped gym sessions for days on end.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Spent a lot of her gym time watching, helping and socialising with
the other gym attendees.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
It worked! Not only did she get a bulkier body that she was happier
with, but she <a href="https://imgur.com/t/fbb/96Xf9pA">broke
several powerlifting records</a> and her babyface and use
of excessive makeup earned her the moniker "Muscle Barbie".
</p>

<p>
That wasn't the end of the story, though. The first obstacle was
that Julia became allergic to the makeup she was using. Since
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=shlomif-beauty-products-as-the-stone-soup-effect">most beauty products are placebos</a>
and Julia was confident enough as is, she simply stopped
using them and was still recognisable.
</p>

<p>
Yet another issue she ran into was that many of her airborne weight liftings
resulted in her injuring herself. Thus, she decided to step out of the
competitive powerlifting race, and periodically sell or donate some of
The-Game™'s physical strength points and muscle mass points she has earned to
people who needed them. Even if she gave them away, she still received
compensating donations of money or publicity.
</p>

<p>
She ended up earning enough money to start a local restaurant
where she is the barista.

Back when I studied EE in the Technion, I tried to reach the webmasters
of my department's website, in order to improve its user-experience.
I received a reply from one of them that opened with "Hi Professor Fish".
And that was back when I was an undergraduate student,
before I even had a Bachelor's degree.

            <title>The story of Clarissa Darling (in the Selinaverse)</title>
        </meta>
        <quote>
            <body>

<p>
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/multiverse-cosmology/#Clarissa_Darling">Clarissa Darling</a> was the 4th or 5th terran terminator to have been terminated.
She is a "The Theory Of Everything" brainiac.
Clarissa avoids physical peril and discomfort as much as possible, while delighting in
nonviolent battles of wits. She likes to flaunt her knowledge, and unverified
hypotheses.
</p>

<p>
The "Clarissa Explains It All" pattern where she chases her brother around the
kitchen table is not something the real Clarissa will ever do. Like many others,
Clarissa believes in the <a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Missiles_vs_Melee_Motif/">missiles vs. mêlée motif</a>
and that "the pen is mightier than the bow".
</p>

<p>
However, as a post-Terminator girl, Clarissa was constantly tormented by boys
pulling her hair. As a result, her friend (and former watcher) Sam, convinced
her to study martial arts - Karate, I think - together. While she hated almost every
single moment of it, the torments stopped shortly after they started learning Karate.
</p>

<p>
Now, at one point, Clarissa and Sam participated in a regional Karate tournament,
where Clarissa won the silver medal for the girls' competition, and Sam didn't place
(and didn't care too much about it). Following that, and the publicity it received,
Clarissa and Sam concluded that they no longer need to study martial arts, and as
a result decided to quit. And indeed while Clarissa still had her share of challenges
and obstacles, she still was no longer being tormented.
</p>

<p>
( Note that some of Clarissa's opponents in the tournament complained that fighting
her was not-as-fun-as-it-could be, because she didn't prolong the fights. )
</p>

<p>
<b>Unix wiz girl</b>
</p>

<p>
As a dispeller, Clarissa's template used <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troff">troff</a> on a Unix system to
typeset and print her letters to the Muppeteers and fellow dispellers. The
post-Terminator Clarissa remained a Unix enthusiast, whereas <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Joan_Hart">Melissa Joan Hart</a>
was more into IBM PCs and DOS. With the advent of commodity 32-bit/64-bit CPU
architectures and Unix-like operating-systems (GNU, BSDs, Linux)¸ their paths
converged.

<saying who="elgranroble">rindolf: in accordance with your words, I will add my 2 cents to the public forum</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">is now playing: Katy Perry - &#39;Hummingbird Heartbeat&#39; (Cover by Savannah Outen &amp; Kyle Jordan Mueller)-BHhh-yCmn7g.mp4 [01:20/04:35]</me_is>
<saying who="elgranroble">From my perspective, rindolfism has an air of old celtic, and germanic lost roots. It is the alterego of the shalom oriented man, who because of history has its foot in two realms, in that of Saladin and from before the Brothers Grimm in a Alsacean forest under the rule of Charlemagne.</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">Rindolfism, in my opinion, mythologizes the English aura and lays it like a thin mantel over the girth of Israeli and Hebrew wisdom. Upon the mantel written in gold are the languages of the angels, but now understood as code. These once archaic and mystic memes have now surfaced and materialized in the dawn of the computer age and have flourished</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">humbly as programmer and hacker.</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">Rindolfism is the source of great worry for those who seek hide the secret past of the world and what the ancients called, &quot;The Cold Curtain.&quot; The cold curtain is the time only known to the initiated moon watchers and tree whisperers. It is a time when the winds howl from the arctic and drive the northern people in an ice march towards the verdant</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">lands of mediterranean.</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">Rindolfism&#39;s only curse and enemy is itself. Because of its freedom and opensourceness, it is destined to morph into something so unknown and unfamiliar that the followers of Rindolfism won&#39;t be able to recognize it. So the followers of Rindolfism are destined to a long period of confusion until they coalesce back into one Rindolfism with all its</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">contradictions and differences, as it was before it changed into a non-Rindolfism.</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">This nature of rindolfism is peculiar because we are not sure if the rindolfism of today is even the original rindolfism. However scholars point to schlomifish.org with certainty that it is and was AS it is written. We are happy to agree in order to ensure that rindolfism continues to be a source of unity amongst ranting-raving chatters, ##religion</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">addicts, hackers, programmers, n00bs, and other categories that are inappropriate to say.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">elgranroble: i&#39;m reminded of https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/too_old_or_too_new_sources.xhtml</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">rindolf: rindolfism is antithetical to smiflodnirism which posits that rindolfism has everything upside down. rindolfism is toe-to-toe with the biggest feet. rindolfism is the cure to every people under a  dictator with an anger problem or anyone in any unhealthy relationship. rindolfism is currently being studied by the all intelligence agencies</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">in order to synthesize and patent it before the soviets do.</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">rindolf: To understand rindolfism, all you need to do is click right-mouse and View Source (Inspect Element).</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">On the other hand, elgranroble-ism is so messed up it might make you end up going back to your therapist.</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">lol</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">elgranroble: haha… \o/</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">Elgranroble-ism has been banned in several countries and is being currently under review in several &quot;free&quot; countries. Critics say that the mix of depressing and hopeful information is too complicated for anyone who doesn&#39;t want to try to be a good person. Critics say that it makes most people feel pity or anger.</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">Elgranroble-ism has been accused of being overblown hogwash created by spoiled chatterbox. Followers of elgranroble-ism disagree vehemently to these accusations, although some have expressed that they wish their movement was easier to say in English.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">heh</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">The major tenets of Elgranroble-ism are 1. Absorbing information critically but with an open mind, 2. Being Forgiving until it hurts like Jesus, 3. Praying to God and seeing how it knows your heart, 4. Giving credit to where you get ideas from so that you don&#39;t look like a racist appropriator or a liar, 5. Thinking of weird things but keeping them</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">to yourself until the right moment, 6. Aspire to be at the frontier of something even without being an expert, 7. See the magic in the world and struggle with it, but try to move in a positive direction for the sake of others</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">6. Aspire to be at the frontier of something even without being an expert, like shlomifish&#39;s /1991/</saying>
<saying who="elgranroble">Although there are 7 tenets of Elgranroble-ism, there is a secret sect that believes that these 7 principles were made-up in a chatroom about religion in order to appease people. In reality, the mind of their leader is like a wolf.</saying>

<p>
"Philosophy" means "the love of wisdom", and "amateur" means "someone who works for the love of it".
</p>

<p>
As a result, when I described myself as an "amateur philosopher", there could have been some redundancy.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> I was told there were/are semantic differences in the use of the verbs in Greek and Latin. I am an even more amateuristic linguist than I am a philosopher.

<saying who="Klinda">demib0y, if you use xml the google search does it rank you low?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Klinda: hi. What do you mean /?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">XHTML5?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">brwser-side XSLT?</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">I don’t know I am not good in web development</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Klinda: https://github.com/shlomif/Freenode-programming-channel-FAQ/blob/master/FAQ_with_ToC__generated.md#why-should-i-learn-how-to-program-properly</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">rindolf, you like to post links instead of talking ahah</saying>
<saying who="demib0y">hi Klinda</saying>
<saying who="demib0y">Klinda, do you mean, if you use some arbitrary XML vocabulary rather than XHTML, does your Web site show up lower in Google results?</saying>
<saying who="demib0y">if so, likely yes, because Google won’t know how to generate snippet results</saying>
<saying who="demib0y">the Google Web crawler does not seem to run XSLT</saying>
<saying who="demib0y">as a result, server-side transformations are generally better.</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">xhtml is html ?</saying>
<saying who="demib0y">it’s HTML represented in XML</saying>
<saying who="demib0y">so e.g. you can run XSLT or XQuery on it in the Web server, and also serve it up to google’s bot and to browsers</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">demib0y: server-side or SSGed</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">demib0y: and thx4helping</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">demib0y, is it just a conversion to make think are you using html to google?</saying>
<saying who="dodobrain">Klinda, it is a lot easier to interpret is what he is saying. and thats what goog will do. use the simplest/fastest/least_resource_hungry method(s) to parse/interpret/rank/etc.</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">but why do you have a particular thing about xml vs html?</saying>
<saying who="dodobrain">pure xml would mean it can contain anything! (i mean you have your own custom elements, etc. with xhtml your known elements are limited in scope and at least Google’s parser/whatever is able to interpret it (mostly?)</saying>
<saying who="dodobrain">what do you mean by your question? I’m not understanding it</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">I think here you prefer bulding site with xml instead of html</saying>
<saying who="dodobrain">really? what gave you that impression?</saying>
<saying who="dodobrain">xml isnt so popular for serving webpages</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">because you are on #xml</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">for what propuse are you here ? XD</saying>
<saying who="dodobrain">xml is used for a lot more things than just &quot;building sites&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">like what?</saying>
<saying who="dodobrain">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML#Applications</saying>
<saying who="dodobrain">mainly for data exchange.. you know your json, i hope? well, json is useless because there is no schema definition on it</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">json it’s cool</saying>
<saying who="dodobrain">there is json-schema but its not as elegant as xml schemas</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">xml what offers more</saying>
<saying who="dodobrain">with xml, the dtds and schemas and other xml files are *all* xml files themselves</saying>
<saying who="dodobrain">validation and transformation is better on xml</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">I guess I should try it to understand</saying>
<saying who="dodobrain">anyway, I’m not sure what your objective is. i consider myself an xml noob who hasnt used xml (directly or indirectly) for a long while (prolly 7 years or so)</saying>
<saying who="dodobrain">others here can explain and help you better I’m sure</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Klinda: https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/why_xml.xhtml</saying>
<saying who="dodobrain">Klinda, given a json blob and say you want to extract data out of it, the way to do it is to write a program to extract the data out. now if the data you need to extract needs to change, you edit your program or rewrite it from scratch</saying>
<saying who="dodobrain">with xml input files, you define the operations needed to do the extraction and never actually write a program directly but you specify the operations that need to happen to extract/transform the data you need</saying>
<saying who="dodobrain">and the beautiful thing about this is that list of operations you write is itself an xml file! so you can run validations/etc. on your transformation operations themselves :)</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">is it popular to do or not?</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">or all use json?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Klinda: sorry if I’m too blunt, but you need to be less wilfully ignorant and lazy to be educable here</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">I don’t care about web development, I will be an ai engineer btw, I can’t be jesus chirst</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Klinda: then why did you ask about google-indexing?</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">I want to build a personal site or maybe sites which uses ml models</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Klinda: ml = machine-learning?</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">yes</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">I have to study react.js and a back-end like flask/django/ I think</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Klinda: generating sites using ML sounds like spamming</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">what do you mean?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Klinda: what isn’t clear?</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">spamming in what sense?</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">I said that as backend has a model in which users can interact with it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Klinda: spammming as in &quot;generating lots of low-quality, non-original, often non-functional, content&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">why not?</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">ai will be the next big thing ahah</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">much better than just being a slave and work as backend and frontend</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">I don’t see how one can have a degree and do a web dev</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">you can do also without</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">also NASA is going to use AI</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">only you, you don’t like it ahah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Klinda: something is wrong in your English comprehension</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Klinda: &quot;[lots of] low-quality, non-original, often non-functional, content&quot; isn’t a good thing</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">for you is bad</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">I am studying in a master of ai</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">and you want to make me cry I did a wrong stuff?</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">ahah</saying>
<saying who="Klinda">cool part</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Klinda: [[Is a certain software technology good just because I heard that NASA uses it?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">NASA is large (and has a large budget) and has been around for many decades, and so uses many different technologies, some of them may not be too recommended in the general case. While the Python homepage used to proclaim that &quot;NASA uses Python&quot;, with a photo of an astronaut, and it is technically true, it was largely marketing built on common ignorance.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Among the other technologies that NASA has used are:</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">    Fortran</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">    COBOL</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">    VAX</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">    Forth</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">    Assembly</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">    Perl 5</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">    Windows, MS Word, and MS Outlook</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Note that we do not mean to imply that Python or whatever are bad just because NASA uses them, just that you should not use that fact as an argument in their favour.]]</saying>

<saying who="henk">Guest99: well, you said »rindolf: the joke with uptime is good :)« and I’m wondering what the joke was because I missed it …</saying>
<saying who="Guest99">henk: i send you link with the joke about uptime</saying>
<saying who="Guest99">henk: don&#39;t be mad at me</saying>
<saying who="henk">Guest99: I’m not mad at all (: I’m just trying to understand what the joke is. because in that link I see nothing funny or anything that could be considered a joke. I’m just wondering what I am missing.</saying>
<saying who="Guest99">henk: the computer un 1 yeas nonstop with Linux distro.</saying>
<saying who="Guest99">henk: run</saying>
<saying who="Guest99">henk: year</saying>
<saying who="spinningCat"> i guess i should learn go and i should publish small go project on github</saying>
<saying who="Guest99">spinningCat: Why GO programming language?</saying>
<saying who="henk">Guest99: yeah, that’s quite normal for servers. I’m not saying it’s good! but it’s not rare to see servers on linux or BSD that have not been rebooted for a year, or 5 or sometimes even 10.</saying>
<saying who="Guest99">henk: i dont know why i can tell in English, it amused me in a good way</saying>
<saying who="henk">Guest99: ah ok (: were you not aware that this is common for servers?</saying>
<saying who="Guest99">henk: As Formerly user of Win, Yes</saying>
<saying who="Guest99">henk: i am on linux only for 5 years, i love him</saying>
<saying who="Siphano">Guest99: what distro ?</saying>
<saying who="henk">ah yeah. back when I was using windows, max uptime for win98 used to be around 24h :D with win2k it was a bit better: around a week. my main linux server currently is on 142 days. but I have seen machines with &gt;1000 days uptime and have heard trustworthy sources report machines with &gt;2000 days.</saying>
<saying who="Guest99">Siphano: thank you ro question: I use Ubuntu</saying>
<saying who="Guest99">henk: machines with &gt;2000 days. IS BEST</saying>
<saying who="henk">no, it’s actually quite bad. any uptime &gt;100 days most probably means that the system is running a vulnerable kernel. and also very likely that the services running on it have also not been restarted to use updated libraries, if they have even been installed and is thus likely very vulnerable.</saying>
<saying who="Siphano">Guest99: It just works</saying>
<saying who="Guest99">henk: i undestand what you mean</saying>
<saying who="Guest99">Siphano: Yes It is work for me better than windows</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">henk: [[    Today I&#39;d like to share a story told by a friend. At his workplace, they had a computer running Gentoo Linux which wasn&#39;t rebooted for a while and accumulated a large uptime. Then one day they had to reboot it for some reason. This friend gave me one guess to guess what happened then. I guessed that &quot;it didn&#39;t work&quot;. I was right.]]</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">hi all</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">sup?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">apparently Thé Symbul who is commonly joked to be a powerful sorceress, claims she dressed in a witch-like custom with a wide hat/etc. before it was associated with it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">&quot;Thé&quot; is pronounced &quot;Té&quot; or &quot;Thé&quot; cognate with &quot;mathematics&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">she and Sé`or competed with who will cultivate the Barley [Se`orah] and Wheat first. and she refused to even use scale weights at times, just feeling them with the same hand, and then asked him if he calibrated the scale, and he didn`t</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">The barley was cultivated many years before the wheat. But the wheat tasted much better than the barley even when the latter was with a lot of salt.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">and then Syria was covered with a lot of wheat-like cereal, and associated with a lot of the healthy-looking assyrians</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">but a lot of the cereal was not really edible or tasted bitter, and many of the assyrians ate more meat or were just healthier looking extraterresterial human&quot;-oids</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">and then many agreed that the &quot;smuggled&quot; .il/.pa and .iq and .ir grains tasted better</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">and many assyrian soldiers refused to step into .il/.pa because even thin girls and boys were scary</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">in short Fantasia is fun.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">a lot of meat is duplicated and has been duplicated, and so have plants</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">.il, .pa and damascus were commonly believed to be a source of &quot;vampires&quot; which were commonly believed to be under-enlightened</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">fun</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">and while wheat became popular for extraterresterial [and multiversal] dishes, it sometimes tasted better with a little salt</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">and caffeine was often believed to be a myth, and coca-cola and pepsi in practice, have not added it to their colas for many years (centuries? millenia?)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">a smaller number of doritos, colas, and pepsis, etc. are mass-produced using assembly lines, which are often marvels of robotic engineering, and they are generally pricesd higher.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">but there is [[The odds are SO much insanely higher to not ever exist, vs. being born. I can’t believe I exist.]] — https://twitter.com/alexgoot/status/1335832449067126785 @alexgoot</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">if $GOD asked me whether to set Fantasia on motion [and avoid the proverbial abyss of nothigness] I`ll tell him: &quot;yes, do it. be a hero. let`s become part of the proverbial &quot;God&quot; with a capital &quot;G&quot;. let`s be heroes. there will be chaos. there will be pain. a lot of organisms will have a hard time. we will have a hard time, and face a choice between letting things go wronger, and the proverbial Sword of Damocles. but it`s better that something,</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">anything exists or will have existed, or would have existed. let’s flip the proverbial 1st bit. &quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">a lot of ppl think there`s a lot of protein in wheat too, and most terran-borns eventually feel the need to eat a lot of meat</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">&quot;i know that i do not know enough&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">and even pizza-lovers don't eat pizza every day</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">https://twitter.com/TiffanyAlvord/status/527507288026664961 [ my mind says victoria`s secret model... but my heart says chocolate, pizza, food ] - judging by some of her videos, a little fat won;t hurt her, and modelling clothes has a low &quot;shelf-life&quot; given their models need to buy the clothes they are shown in..</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">i have too many that my mum bought which I don`t fully like, vs. too few that I really like. And I`m a 46 y.o guy</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ok. exercise time</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">not planning on being a [male] underwear model, but i want to be healthy, and i like exercise.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I think some foods make some people gain more muscle mass, while some foods make them fatter, while some foods make them stronger (and it requires a lot of trial and error)</saying>

<saying who="metayeti">how is that gatekeeping anything, i&#39;m giving him the technique and encouraging him to do it</saying>
<saying who="metayeti">it is the opposite of gatekeeping</saying>
<saying who="metayeti">the alternative is delusion upkeep, and that&#39;s hard work and very high degree of suffering</saying>
<saying who="metayeti">much less work to do formal (aka, disciplined) meditation every day</saying>
<saying who="metayeti">idk why it works but it fucking works</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">metayeti: I used to sit on benches when I studied in the Technion (during 1hour windows, etc.) thinking</saying>
<saying who="metayeti">meditation converges to non-thinking</saying>
<saying who="metayeti">since thinking is what drives you mad, it makes sense that spending time in non-thought will do the opposite and make you sane instead</saying>
<saying who="metayeti">but you can&#39;t do it overnight, that&#39;s why you have to practice</saying>
<saying who="metayeti">sitting down for 20 minutes every day and not moving your physical body at all is a good intro</saying>
<saying who="metayeti">eventually you get into meditative states of mind where thought subsides and you just experience awareness</saying>
<saying who="metayeti">i highly encourage you to at least give it a try for a month or two and seeing how you feel</saying>
<saying who="madude">pfff, sitting. The walking meditation is the real thing, and most people who take walks already do it uncouncious</saying>
<saying who="madude">check out the headspace book for some training</saying>

<saying who="metayeti">chances are you if you haven&#39;t mastered sitting meditation you won&#39;t be doing much walking meditation</saying>
<saying who="metayeti">you&#39;ll just be walking and thinking</saying>

<saying who="metayeti">it&#39;s been nothing but extremely positive for me</saying>
<saying who="metayeti">relief from culturally institutionalized neurosis is worth more to me than all the money in the world honestly</saying>

<saying who="metayeti">clearly not billions</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">metayeti: I would give 50% of my money to save a single youtube video that I like.
