I wrote the first version of
<a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/freecell-solver/">
Freecell Solver</a> during a Spring break, because I was interested
to find out if a design I thought about would work.
</li>
<li>
Since then, it saw 13 major versions, each one adding more features
or improving the overall speed or memory consumption.
</li>
<li>
In this lecture, I would like to tell about some of the changes I
embodied in the program, many of which would be relevant to programming
different applications.
