            Since <link
                xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/">“Putting
                All the Cards on the Table (2014)”</link> was written and
            finalised, I kept linking to individual sections of it, and
            it proved to be popular and many people liked
            individual sections of it, or the essay itself as a whole.
        </para>

        <para>
            One thing I now regret about it
            is the word "All" because I now realise that
            <emphasis role="bold">honesty is
                a process</emphasis>, and so is <emphasis role="bold">enlightenment</emphasis> and if
            you stop searching for a bigger and better “truth”, you
            stop being honest.
        </para>

        <para>
            Nevertheless, after sometime over a year, I feel that a sequel to it
            is in order, collecting and organising a <emphasis role="bold">(hopefully
                large) subset</emphasis> of the various insights I collected
            in many posts and comments on various social media outlets,
            as well as in some stories, screenplays, aphorisms, etc. So here goes.

        <para>
            Many people I know are being far too much misers: they
            care too much about people not spending a small amount
            of money, which in turn will buy them some time, bring
            them joy, or enlighten and/or inspire them. However,
            the time of productive humans, as well as their
            self-esteem and spiritual and tangible possessions, are
            far more important than a small gain of money.

        ««««««
A small anecdote from a story I got an idea for, which seems like the epitome
of blasphemy and political incorrectness, but still is pretty cool:

Three Celtic girls from the village where they provided the Greek with salt,
decide to travel to Damascus and beyond. They hitchhike a ride with some
Assyrian merchants who eventually disarm them and tell them at sword point that
they'll rape them.

The girls consult between themselves and decide that if they're going to have
sex, they might as well cooperate and enjoy it. So they have sex with the men
willingly. And after a few times the three men lose stamina while the girls
are not completely satisfied and cry for more! ☺
        »»»»»»
    - Miranda Kerr having a lot of sex with various willing men after
    becoming separated from her husband, and bragging about it.
        - "So she has become a slut? So cool!".

* Intelligence/epsionage:
    - Not about keeping secrets away from people who really really want to
    know.
    - Keeping the whole mass of data and information away from the general
    populace.
    - Best policy: never deny or admit anything you think may be a problem.

    - "Fit" started to mean a [sexually] attractive
    member-of-the-approriate-sex (= MOTAS) in British slang.

    good self-esteem, for confidence, and for extra attractivity points.
        - Not required.
        - Not a panacea.

* From https://plus.google.com/+ShlomiFish/posts/i5Z8XdqTdwE :

* The proper way to run an election campaign:

««««««
I detailed the way I thought of to run an election campaign here: http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/human-hacking-field-guide-v2/homecoming_queen.html - on that section, the story’s Alpha Female, Eve “Erisa” Siegel, admits that winning the title of homecoming queen won’t make much of a difference to her, but that she still wants it, and instead of a smear or insult campaign, she supports and respects the other candidates.

Furthermore, you shouldn't give up if you lose ( #NeverGiveUp : Matsuoka Shuzo [松岡修造 ] - あきらめかけているあなた (NEVER GIVE UP!!) [English] ), and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonix released videos on YouTube before, while, and after their performance on the televised Sing-off competition (and I find them very nice). What I describe Principle Snyder doing in http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Buffy/A-Few-Good-Slayers/ is that after he has lost the election for mayor, he offered the actual winner to be his assistant and to help him as much as he can, and he eventually become mayor in the next election .

Hollywood depicted a worse way to run an election campaign with Hulk Hogan on Suddenly Susan where he maintains a false image instead of being himself - https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hollywood%20hogan%20suddenly%20susan (these were my favourite two episodes of that show). And this whole ordeal materialised with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_schwarzenegger 's “Girly Men” campaign for the Californian  governor elections, but really could have been avoided.

* "Wine, Women, and Song".

There are three important things in life for one’s self-esteem:

1. Good food and drinks ("Wine") - see http://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/27195/maimonides-advice-about-dieting

2. Good company of any sex ("Women").

3. Clean, creative, fun, however unprofessional and low quality. ("Song"): Christina Grimmie - "Feelin' Good"

If you're a wage slave, who does not eat well, does not enjoy the company of
his family or friends, and does not have fun, then not only are you unhappy,
but you are really unproductive and lazy:
http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#laziness_vs_productivity
.

* Classical music:
    - museum pieces.
    - See http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4229
    - https://plus.google.com/+ShlomiFish/posts/BKeGPY7cCVT
    - Remakes / covers / fanfiction.
        - Lessig’s Remix book.
        - crossovers / mash-ups.

* https://twitter.com/AlexGMusic8/status/474284103349456896
    - «I just genuinely don't understand the need for complete and utter 100%
      nakedness in the women's locker room at the gym. Ahhhhhh #help»
    - What my friend noted about him being a "heterophobe" who cannot stand
    seeing other men naked.
        - That only women will get it.
    - Noting that people should still be free to experience (or produce)
    porn or soft porn or erotica or whatever in the privacy of their
    own home.

* http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/2api0a/how_to_write_essays_in_2014_stylewise_and/

««««««
This essay/article which someone linked to on Freenode's ##programming is a prime example of how you should write essays in this day and age:

http://brikis98.blogspot.in/2014/05/dont-learn-to-code-learn-to-think.html

Mainly it has:

1. Many images that are often relevant.

2. Short paragraphs.

3. Easily skimable text.

4. Many text embellishments such as bullets, itemised lists, bold, etc.

This is as opposed to a text with long paragraphs/etc.

This is not a new trend. Russians pride themselves on having the best 19th century and 20th century novelists, but even https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment is much less usable and popular than those of French, British and  American novelists: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Eyre ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Island ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Railway_Children - all novels that aged extremely well.

Even a large part of the Jewish Bible / Tanakh / Old Testament is extremely succinct and to the point (not sure about the so-called New Testament).

Sesame Street was accused of encouraging illiteracy and trying to sugarcoat learning, and other stuff like that, but it improved the standard for television, cinema and the written word considerably.

Similar criticisms had been voiced about Socrates in ancient Greece, and now people say similar things about Twitter, Facebook or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic (♥!).

I however, am pretty sure that the young generation of today which receives many "bad" influences from such social media mediums and popular culture franchises, will grow and mature nicely enough. And as sexualised or violent My Little Pony, the Big Bang Theory or Game of Thrones or whatever are, they've got nothing on the Old Testament... ☺

    - Marriage should not be considered different in the bylaws vs. a couple
    living together and possibly having children.
        - Most children in Denmark being born outside marriage.
