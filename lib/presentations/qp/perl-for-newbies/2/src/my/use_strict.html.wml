<p>
Perl has a pragma (= an interpreter-related directive) known as 
<tt>use strict;</tt>, which among other things, makes sure all the variables
you use will be declared with <tt>my</tt>. If you reference a variable
that was not declared with <tt>my</tt> it will generate an error.
</p>

<p>
Using <tt>use strict</tt> is in most cases a good idea, because it minimises
the number of errors because of typos. Just type <tt>use strict;</tt> at the 
beginning of your program and you can sleep better at nights.
</p>

<p>
As an example, here is the primes program, <tt>use strict</tt>-ed:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/my/primes_us.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
Notice the use of <tt>my</tt> in the declaration of the <tt>foreach</tt> loop. 
Such just-in-time declarations, inspired by C++, are possible in perl.
