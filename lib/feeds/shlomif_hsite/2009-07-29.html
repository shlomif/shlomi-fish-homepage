<!-- TITLE=New Look, New Humour Items, Updated Software Pages and More-->
<p>
The biggest news this time is that <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">the
    site</a> has an opossum new look based on an
adapted version of <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/smoked">the
    smoked WordPress Theme</a> by iconstantin. There may be some more quirks
lurking in the design, so please report them to me if you find them. I’d also
like to thank <a href="http://www.zoffix.com/">Zoffix Znet</a> and other IRC
people for some insights on how to fix problems I had with adapting the CSS.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#what_does_IDK_stand_for">There’s
    a new joke on the Aphorisms page</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    What does “IDK” stand for? I don’t know.
    </p>

and a <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/how-many-newsgroup-readers-does-it-take-to-change-a-lightbulb.html">a
    new bit I’ve copied from elsewhere: “How Many
    [Usenet] Newsgroup Readers does it Take to Change a Lightbulb?”</a>
</p>

on the page was replaced by a much superior
<a href="http://sharethis.com/">Share This</a> button. Hope you enjoy
it.

<p>
Enjoy!
