<h2>New Additions to the Site</h2>

<p>
Exactly two weeks passed since the last update and many things have been
added or improved. Read below for what’s new.
</p>
<p>
Two of the pages in <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/MathVentures/">the
    MathVentures section</a> were converted to use embedded
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a>. This should make viewing
them with MathML-compliant browsers easier. The old ASCII-art based pages are 
still available.
</p>

<p>
The ideas 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/ideas/#tucan">Tucan</a> and
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/ideas/#unixdoc">Unixdoc</a>
were added to the Random Ideas page.
</p>

<p>
I’ve placed <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/nostalgia/">some of 
    my old DOS-era programs online</a> for your amusement.
</p>

<p>
I added a <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/#site_history">question
    about the site history</a> to the <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/">FAQ</a>.
</p>

<p>
More CDs were added to the <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/art/recommendations/music/">Music Recommendations</a>.
</p>

<p>
There’s <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#if_god_exists">a new
    Joke</a> in the Humour archive.
