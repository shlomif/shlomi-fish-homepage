Summary of sh/Bash Lecture:
===========================

Motivation:
-----------

* Bash is the de-facto shell on Linux.

* One can write and debug complete scripts on one-line of the command prompt.

* Sometimes Bash scripts are faster to write and/or easier to understand
  than the equivalent perl scripts.

*

Basic Usage:
------------

- Executing simple commands: command name followed by parameters
    Examples:
        ls
        ls -l
        cp test.pl old_test.pl

- Filename Matching mechanisms:
    *
    []
    ?
    Examples:
        ls -l *.c
        cp *.c ./bak_dir

- Pipeline: explain a little about standard input/standard output, then show
    the following redirection mechanisms:
    |
    >
    <
    Examples:
        ls -l | less
        cat *.c *h | wc -l
        ls -l | grep ^d | wc -l

- The ";" - executing more than one statements in the same batch. A
    synchronous executions.
    Examples:
        cd ./test_dir ; tar -czvf ../test_dir.tar.gz *

- The "(" .. ")" - grouping statements inside a _subshell_ (separate process).
    Examples:
        ( cd ./bin ; ls d* ) > files_in_bin_that_start_with_a_d.txt

- The "{" .. "}" - grouping statement in the same shell (not a separate
  process).
    Examples:
        { cd ./bin ; ls d* } > files_in_bin_that_start_with_a_d.txt

- Using the backslash (with no whitespace afterwards) to split commands across
  several lines. Eases readability:
    Examples:
        cp *.c *.h README Makefile TODO \
            USAGE INSTALL \
                ./bak

- Introducing comments with "#". They start with a # and extend to the end of
  the line.

Variables:
----------

- Simple assignment: "=". (note that there cannot be any whitespace before
and after the "=" symbol.)
    Examples:
    A=hello
    B=yellow ; turn=500

- Retrieving the value of a variable using $ or ${} . (not $() !)
    Examples:
        - A=hello
          echo $A
        - VARIABLE=5
          B=${VARIABLE}
          VARIABLE=800
          echo $B
        - A=Y
          Y=80
          echo ${$A}

- A little about interpolation: A dollar can appear anywhere. If the shell
  encounters a $ which is not followed by curly brackets ("{" .. "}") it will
  try to interpolate its name from as many characters as it find, even if
  a variable by that name does not exist. Thus, when in doubt, use the
  "${NAME}" form.

    Examples:
        - A=hello
          echo $Aworld
          # does not print helloworld


- The "${parameter:-defaultvalue}" form enables you to give the expression a
  default value in case the variable is not assigned.
    Examples:
        -
            #!/bin/bash

            ;
            ; Possibly set A
            B=${A:-not_set}
            ; Check if B is equal to not_set and accordingly do something.

- To unset a variable use the "unset" command:
    Examples:
        -
            #!/bin/bash
            A=5
            B=80
            RESULT=400
            echo $A \* $B = $RESULT
            unset A B RESULT

- To display a list of the declared variables and their values, use the "set"
  command without any options. (set is of little use in scripts except for
  debugging purposes).

  Examples:
     -
        A=32482 ; B=932840 ; C=1932840 ; D=890 ; E=hello ; F=world
        unset A E
        set | grep '^[A-F]='

- The "read VARNAME" command reads a line from the standard output and puts
  it inside the variable "VARNAME".
    Examples:
        echo "Please enter your name:"
        read NAME
        echo Hello $NAME


    - Note: Be careful not to use "read $VARNAME" when it's not appropriate.
        For example:
            #!/bin/sh
            A=B
            B=A
            read $A
            echo A is $A
            echo B is $B

Quoting, Backslashing and other animals
---------------------------------------

- A backslash before a character denotes an "actual" character. Hence means,
  it cannot be processed by the shell.
    Examples:
        -
        echo Hello\ \ \ \ \ World        # vs.
        echo Hello     World
        -
        echo good ; echo you
        echo good \; echo you                    # vs.
        -
        echo \\ - This is a backslash


- Use the double quotes to group strings which include whitespaces and
  keywords:
    Examples:
        echo "Hello   World"          # vs.
        echo Hello    World

    Note: double quotes do interpolation. For example:
        #!/bin/sh
        A=Hello
        echo "$A    world!"

- Use the single quotes to group strings which include whitespace, dollars
  and backslashes without doing variable interpolation:
    Examples:
        #!/bin/sh
        A=Hello
        echo '$A    world!'
        echo 'and here's a backslash - \'    # Note that \' is not considered
                                             # an inner single quote.

- Quotes and regular texts can be arbitrarily combined (but not nested !)
    Examples:
        #!/bin/sh
        myvar="young at heart"
        echo "Some pe"ople are "${myvar}".
        echo 'Me, 'included\!

Conditionals, Loops and Program Return Codes
--------------------------------------------

- Use the if statement to specify a conditional. Syntax:
    if <Test Command> ; then
        <If Block>
    elif <Test Command> ; then
        <El-If Block>
        .
        .
        .
    else
        <Else Block>
    fi

    As long as there are semi-colons the commands need not be on separate
    lines. Examples:

    -
        #!/bin/sh
        if test -e hello.txt ; then
            echo "hello.txt exists"
        else
            echo "hello.txt does not exist"
        fi

   Or the same on the same line:

        if test -e hello.txt ; then echo "hello.txt exists" ; else echo \
            "hello.txt does not exist" ; fi

   The latter syntax is useful for on-the-prompt scripting.

   -
        read A
        if expr $A \< 100 > /dev/null ; then
            echo "$A is less than 100"
        fi

        # Note that we need to backslash the < so it won't be hijacked by the
        # shell, and if expr's output is not piped to /dev/null it will appear
        # on the screen

- Use the while loop to repeat a command as long as an expression is met.
    Syntax:
    while <Test Expression> ; do
        <Loop Block>
    done

    Examples:
    -
        #!/bin/sh
        A=0
        while expr $A \< 100 > /dev/null ; do
            echo $A
            A=`expr $A + 1`    # The backticks can be used to trap the output
                               # of the command.
                               # More on that later.
        done

        This program prints the numbers from 0 to 99.

    -
        #!/bin/sh
        find . -name '*.c' |
        (while read T ; do
            cp $T $T.bak ;
        done)

        This program backups all the C files. read returns a false value when
        it encounters an EOF.

- Iterate over a group of values (or filenames) using the for command:
    for VARNAME in value1 value2 value3 ... ; do
        <For Block where you can use $VARNAME>
    done

    Examples:
    -
        for I in *.c *.h ; do
            cp $I $I.bak
        done

- As far as "if" and "while" are concerned a statement is considered true if
    its return code is 0, and false otherwise. The return code of a program is
    the return code of its main() function, or what was passed as a parameter
    to exit().

- The statement "true" always returns 0 and the statement "false" always
    returns 1.

- You can find the return code of the last program ran by using the "$?"
    variable.

- <Statement 1> && <Statement 2> will execute Statement 2 iff Statement 1
    returns a true value.

  <Statement 1> || <Statement 2> will execute Statement 2 iff Statement 1
    returns a false value.

  For example:

    (cd hello/ && ls) > hello.files.txt

    test -e hello.xcf || {
        echo "hello.xcf does not exist";
        exit
        }

- Functions: syntax:
    function hello() {
        ## Body Of Function ##
    }

    Functions are used as simple commands and with the same calling syntax.



Trapping Command Output
-----------------------

- Use the $( ... ) and ` ... ` constructs to trap the output of commands. The
    difference between the two is that `` acts very simliarly to the ""
    quotes, in the fact that it expands variables and so forth. $( ... ) on
    the other hand, acts much like a sub-shell while differing only in the
    fact that the output of the command is trapped.

    Examples:

        A=$(cat hello.txt | grep mystring | head -1)

        A=`cat hello.txt | grep mystring | head -1`

        C=`expr $A + $B` # Adds A and B and put the result in C

- Another option is to pipe the command output to a sub-shell or sub-script:

    Examples:

    - find . -name '*.[ch]' -print |
        (
        while read T ;
            do cp $T $T.bak
        done
        )

    - cat hello.txt | head -3 | { read A ; read B ; read C} # Put the
                            # first three lines of hello.txt in A, B and C.


- You can redirect the standard error to the standard output using the "2>&1"
  consturct. If you wish to put it in a separate file, use "2>". The same can
  be done with other file descriptors assuming they are used by your program.
  (which usually is a bad idea).

  Note: you need to append 2>&1 to the _end_ of the command, otherwise
  something entirely different will occur.

  Note: a shorthand for "make > hello.txt 2>&1" is "make &> hello.txt".
