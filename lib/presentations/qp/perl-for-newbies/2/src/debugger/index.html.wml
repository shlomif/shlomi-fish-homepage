<p>
Even if your perl code compiles and runs, it doesn't mean it is error free.
Very often you will write programs that when given specific input, will behave 
very differently from their intended behaviour. Perl supplies the user with a
debugger that can help in trapping such bugs in the program.
</p>

<p>
The debugger is invoked simply by appending a "-d" switch before the script
name. E.g: <tt>perl -d hello.pl</tt>. After typing "Return" at the shell command
line, you will have an interactive debugging session at your disposal. At this
session, you can control the execution of your program as well as enter any 
Perl command you like.
</p>

<p>
The following chapter will cover the basics of using the perl debugger, and
will give you pointers on where to find more information.
