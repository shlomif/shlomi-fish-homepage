<p>
Perl has two operators <tt>&lt;=&gt;</tt> and <tt>cmp</tt>, which are very
useful when wishing to sort arrays. <tt>$a &lt;=&gt; $b</tt> returns -1 if 
<tt>$a</tt> is numerically lesser than <tt>$b</tt>, 1 if it's greater, and
zero if they are equal.
</p>

<p>
<tt>cmp</tt> does the same for string comparison. For instance the previous 
example could be re-written as:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/useful_funcs/sort/integer_sort_cmp.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
Much more civil, isn't it? The following example, sorts an array of strings
in reverse:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/useful_funcs/sort/reverse_string_sort.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>
