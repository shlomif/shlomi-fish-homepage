<!-- TITLE=Translations of Stories to Hebrew (For the Alternative Book Week)-->
<p>
Here are the recent updates for Shlomi Fish's Homepage. Most of these are
ongoing translations of various English stories to Hebrew. These were done
in preparation for the “Alternative Book Week” in
<a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/" rel="nofollow">Tel Aviv University</a> (see its
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=122261137854339" rel="nofollow">Facebook 
    page</a>). It is going to take place on Tuesday, 31 May 2011 between 09:30 
and 16:30 in Tel Aviv University, next to the Gilman building, the department
of Humanities. Several independent writers are going to read from their 
prose there, including me. You are welcome to attend, listen to the
participating writers, and provide us with welcome support and input. Hope to
see you there!

There's <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#cats-in-soviet-russia" rel="nofollow">a
    new joke in the aphorisms and quotes page</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In Soviet Russia, cats own you. No, wait! Cats own you everywhere.

I posted the first part of my 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selena-Mandrake/" rel="nofollow"><i>Selena 
        Mandrake - The Slayer</i></a> screenplay to
<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989657/1/" rel="nofollow">its 
    place in FanFiction.net</a> where one can rate it and post comments. There
is some new text in the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selena-Mandrake/ideas.txt" rel="nofollow">ideas
for the future</a> document.
</p>

<p>
I started preparing a
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/humanity/ongoing-text-hebrew.html" rel="nofollow">Hebrew 
    translation</a> of my
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/humanity/" rel="nofollow"><i>Humanity - 
        The Movie</i></a> screenplay.
</p>

<p>
There are two new fortunes in <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/" rel="nofollow">fortune collection</a>.
</p>

<p>
We now mirror the web parody
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/was-the-death-star-attack-an-inside-job/" rel="nofollow">“Uncomfortable Questions: Was the Death Star Attack an Inside Job?”</a> (via Websurdity and <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/questions.htm" rel="nofollow">Debunking 911</a>). 
</p>

<p>
The various screenplays in English in the 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/" rel="nofollow">stories section</a> now 
have better capitalisation, punctuation and grammar, and their visual style 
was also improved. There are also many
grammatical corrections to the story
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/" rel="nofollow"><i>The 
        Human Hacking Field Guide</i></a> and a lot of progress was made in
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/hebrew-v2.html" rel="nofollow">its
    Hebrew translation</a>. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/XML-Grammar/Fiction/" rel="nofollow">The
    XML-Grammar-Fiction page</a> now
contains coverage of Screenplay-Text and Screenplay-XML, as well as examples
for the grammars and their outputs.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy!
