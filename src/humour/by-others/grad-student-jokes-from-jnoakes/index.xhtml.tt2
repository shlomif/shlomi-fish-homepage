<p>
A grad student, a post-doc, and a professor are walking through a city park
and they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out in a
puff of smoke.
</p>

<p>
The Genie says, "I usually only grant three wishes, so I'll give each of you
just one."
</p>

<p>
"Me first! Me first!" says the grad student. "I want to be in the Bahamas,
driving a speedboat with a gorgeous woman who sunbathes topless." Poof! He's
gone.
</p>

<p>
"Me next! Me next!" says the post-doc. "I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on
the beach with a professional hula dancer on one side and a Mai Tai on the
other." Poof! He's gone.
</p>

<p>
"You're next," the Genie says to the professor.
</p>

<p>
The professor says, "I want those guys back in the lab after lunch."

<p>
One sunny day, a rabbit came out of her hole in the ground to enjoy the fine weather. The day was so nice that she became careless and a fox snuck up behind her and caught her.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to eat you for lunch!" said the fox. "Wait!" replied the rabbit," You should at least wait a few days."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yeah? Why should I wait?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am just finishing my dissertation on 'The Superiority of Rabbits over Foxes and Wolves.'"
</p>

<p>
"Are you crazy? I should eat you right now! Everyone knows that a fox will always win over a rabbit."
</p>

<p>
"Not according to my research. If you like, you can come into my hole and read it for yourself. If you are not convinced, you can go ahead and eat me for lunch."
</p>

<p>
"You really are crazy!" said the fox, but since the fox was curious and had nothing to lose, it went into the hole with the rabbit.
</p>

<p>
The fox never came out.
</p>

<p>
A few days later, the rabbit was again taking a break from writing when a
wolf came out of the bushes and was ready to set upon her.
</p>

<p>
"Wait!" yelled the rabbit," You can't eat me right now."
</p>

 <p>
"And why might that be, my furry appetizer?" said the wolf.
</p>

<p>
"I am almost finished with my dissertation on 'The Superiority of Rabbits over Foxes and Wolves.'"
</p>

<p>
The wolf laughed so hard he almost let go of the rabbit. "Maybe I shouldn't eat you--you really are sick in the head! You might have something contagious."
</p>

<p>
"Come and read it for yourself, you can eat me afterwards if you disagree with my conclusions."
</p>

<p>
So the wolf went down into the rabbit's hole...and never came out.
</p>

<p>
The rabbit finished her dissertation and was out celebrating in the local lettuce patch.
</p>

<p>
Another rabbit came along and asked, "What's up? You seem very happy."
</p>

<p>
"Yup, I just finished my dissertation."
</p>

<p>
"Congratulations! What's it about?"
</p>

<p>
"'The Superiority of Rabbits over Foxes and Wolves.'"
</p>

<p>
"No way! That can't be right."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but it is. Come and read it for yourself."
</p>

<p>
So the two rabbits went down into the rabbit hole. As they entered, the friend saw the typical graduate abode. A computer with the controversial work was in one corner surrounded by discarded papers. And on one side of the room there was a pile of fox bones, while on the other side there was a pile of wolf bones. And in the center, there was a large, well-fed lion.
</p>

<p>
The moral of the story:
</p>

<p>
The title of your dissertation doesn't matter. The subject doesn't matter. The research doesn't matter. All that matters is who your advisor is.

You are probably familiar with the following, based on a column in Ann Landers:
</p>

<ol>
<li>He never got a Ph.D. </li>
<li>He had only one major publication. </li>
<li>It wasn't published in a refereed journal. </li>
<li>Some doubt that he wrote it Himself. </li>
<li>Sure, he created the world, but what has he done since? </li>
<li>The scientific community can't replicate his results. </li>
<li>He rarely came to class and just tells students, "Read the book." </li>
<li>His office hours are irregular and sometimes held on a mountaintop. </li>
<li>He doesn't present at conferences. </li>
<li>He spent too much time teaching and not enough time doing research. </li>
</ol>

[% END %]

[% WRAPPER h2_section id = "damn" title = "Top ten reasons why He doesn't give a damn:" %]

<ol>
<li>He's the boss. </li>
<li>His only publication is still the most influential in the field, with millions of citations a year. </li>
<li>Sure He didn't write it Himself, but with 12 grad students, would you? </li>
<li>Everybody says "Amen" to His opinions. </li>
<li>Disagree with Him, and you may end up in hell. </li>
<li>He's well known for being a hard worker: six days a week nonstop; rests only on the 7th. </li>
<li>Nobody can beat His 4.5 billion years of field work and 3.5 billion years of DNA expertise. </li>
<li>Most agree He was the first one to be awarded a Nobel prize. Nobel himself. </li>
<li>His research facilities are simply the best: Even well funded scientists will admit they work in conditions which are "far from Heaven" when asked. </li>
<li>He doesn't depend on NSF money. </li>
</ol>

This next list is rather obviously <em>not</em> from Ann Landers:

<li>Some even doubt he wrote it by himself. </li>
<li>It may be true that he created the world, but what has he done since then? </li>
<li>His cooperative efforts have been quite limited. </li>
<li>The scientific community has had a hard time replicating his results. </li>
<li>He never applied to the ethics board for permission to use human subjects. </li>
<li>When one experiment went awry he tried to cover it by drowning his subjects. </li>

[% WRAPPER h2_section id = "bloop" title = "Student Bloopers" %]

<p>
This is a compilation of actual (ALLEGED) student bloopers collected by teachers.  Grad students who TA will probably NOT be surprised by any of them.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Ancient Egypt was inhabited by mummies and they all wrote in hydraulics.  They lived in the Sarah Dessert and traveled by Camelot. The climate of the Sarah is such that the inhabitants have to live elsewhere. </li>
<li>The Bible is full of interesting caricatures. In the first book of the  Bible, Guinessis, Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree. One of their children, Cain, asked, &#34;Am I my brother's son?&#34; </li>
<li>Moses led the Hebrew slaves to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened  bread which is bread made without any ingredients. Moses went up on Mount Cyanide to get the ten commandments. He died before he ever reached Canada. </li>
<li>Solomom had three hundred wives and seven hundred porcupines. </li>
<li>The Greeks were a highly sculptured people, and without them we wouldn't
have history. The Greeks also had myths. A myth is a female moth. </li>
<li>Actually, Homer was not written by Homer but by another man of that name. </li>
<li>Socrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around giving people advice.  They killed him. Socrates died from an overdose of wedlock. After his death,
his career suffered a dramatic decline. </li>
<li>In the Olympic games, Greeks ran races, jumped, hurled the biscuits, and threw the java. </li>
<li>Eventually, the Romans conquered the Greeks. History calls people Romans because they never stayed in one place for very long. </li>
<li>Julius Caesar extinguished himself on the battlefields of Gaul. The Ides  of March murdered him because they thought he was going to be made king. Dying, he gasped out: &#34;Tee hee, Brutus.&#34; </li>
<li>Nero was a cruel tyranny who would torture his subjects by playing the fiddle to them. </li>
<li>Joan of Arc was burnt to a steak and was cannonized by Bernard Shaw.  Finally Magna Carta provided that no man should be hanged twice for the same offense. </li>
<li>In midevil times most people were alliterate. The greatest writer of the futile ages was Chaucer, who wrote many poems and verses and also wrote literature. </li>
<li>Another story was William Tell, who shot an arrow through an apple while  standing on his son's head. </li>
<li>Queen Elizabeth was the &#34;Virgin Queen.&#34; As a queen she was a  success. When she exposed herself before her troops they all shouted &#34;hurrah.&#34; </li>
<li>It was an age of great inventions and discoveries. Gutenberg invented removable type and the Bible. Another important invention was the circulation of blood. Sir Walter Raleigh is a historical figure because he invented cigarettes and started smoking. And Sir Francis Drake circumcised the world with a 100 foot clipper. </li>
<li>The greatest writer of the Renaissance was William Shakespeare. He was born in the year 1564, supposedly on his birthday. He never made much money and is famous only because of his plays. He wrote tragedies, comedies, and hysterectomies, all in Islamic pentameter. Romeo and Juliet are an example  of a heroic couplet. Romeo's last wish was to be laid by Juliet. </li>
<li>Writing at the same time as Shakespeare was Miguel Cervantes. He wrote Donkey Hote. The next great author was John Milton. Milton wrote Paradise Lost.  Then his wife died and he wrote Paradise Regained. </li>
<li>During the Renaissance America began. Christopher Columbus was a great navigator who discovered America while cursing about the Atlantic. His ships were called the <span class="ship">Nina</span>, the <span class="ship">Pinta</span>, and the <span class="ship">Santa Fe</span>. Later, the Pilgrims crossed the ocean, and this was called Pilgrim's Progress. The winter of 1620 was a hard one for the settlers. Many people died and many babies were born. Captain John Smith was responsible for all this. One of the causes of the Revolutionary War was the English put tacks in their tea. Also, the colonists would send their parcels through the post without stamps. Finally the colonists won the War and no loner had to pay for taxis. Delegates from the original 13 states formed the Contented Congress. Thomas Jefferson, a Virgin, and Benjamin Franklin were two singers of the Declaration of Independence.  Franklin discovered electricity by rubbing two cats backwards and  declared, &#34;A horse divided against itself cannot stand.&#34; Franklin died in 1790 and is still dead. Soon the Constitution of the United States was adopted to secure domestic hostility. Under the constitution the people enjoyed the right to keep bare arms. </li>
<li>Abraham Lincoln became America's greatest Precedent. Lincoln's mother died in infancy, and he was born in a log cabin which he built with his own hands. Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves by signing the Emasculation Proclamation. On the night of April 14, 1865, Lincoln went to the theater  and got shot in his seat by one of the actors in a moving picture show. The believed assinator was John Wilkes Booth, a supposedly insane actor. This ruined Booth's career. </li>
<li>Meanwhile in Europe, the enlightenment was a reasonable time. Voltaire invented electricity and also wrote a book called Candy. </li>
<li>Gravity was invented by Issac Walton. It is chiefly noticeable in the autumn when the apples are falling off the trees. </li>
<li>Johann Bach wrote a great many musical compositions and had a large number of children. In between he practiced on an old spinster which he kept up in his attic. Bach died from 1750 to the present. Bach was the most famous composer in the world and so was Handel. Handel was half German half Italian and half English. He was very large. </li>
<li>Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf. He was so deaf he wrote loud music. He took long walks in the forest even when everyone was calling for him. Beethoven expired in 1827 and later died for this. </li>
<li>The French Revolution was accomplished before it happened and catapulted into Napoleon. Napoleon wanted an heir to inherit his power, but since Josephine was a baroness, she couldn't have any children. </li>
<li>The sun never set on the British Empire because the British Empire is in the East and the sun sets in the West. </li>
<li>Queen Victoria was the longest queen. She sat on a thorn for 63 years.  She was a moral woman who practiced virtue. Her death was the final event which ended her reign. </li>
<li>The nineteenth century was a time of a great many thoughts and inventions. People stopped reproducing by hand and started reproducing by machine. The invention of the steamboat caused a network of rivers to spring up.  Cyrus McCormick invented the McCormick raper, which did the work of a hundred men. </li>
<li>Louis Pasteur discovered a cure for rabbis. Charles Darwin was a naturalist who wrote the Organ of the Species. Madman Curie discovered radio.  And Karl Marx became one of the Marx brothers. </li>
<li>The First World War, caused by the assignation of the Arch-Duck by an anahist, ushered in a new error in the anals of human history. </li>

YOUR DEGREE MAY BE CLOSER THAN YOU THINK
We remove the obstacles that cause adults to abandon hope.
DID YOU KNOW that you could earn your legitimate Associate's, Bachelor's, Master's or even
Doctorate degree, utilizing your already existing professional or academic expertise?

Prepare for the professional advancement you deserve.
If you are an adult with a high school diploma and have a minimum of three years of experience
in the field you are seeking a degree in, YOU QUALIFY.

As you know, employers continually hire, promote and give raises to new employees that have
ZERO skills or experience, just because they have that piece of paper.
Take part in the wealth now!   Within days you can apply for that unreachable job, or show your
degree to your employer and demand the raise and promotion that your knowledge and skills
deserve.

How does this work?  You graduate without attending classes, or taking a leave of absence from
your current job.  You receive you degree based on life and work experience!
The degree earned by our students enables them to qualify for career advancement and personal
growth, while breaking down the wall that prevents them from receiving big money.

Degree verification and official transcripts will be provided in writing when requested by
employers and others authorized by the graduate. Our college &#38; University transcripts meet the
highest academic standards. Our University issues a degree printed on premium diploma paper,
bearing an official gold raised college seal.

No one is turned down.

Confidentiality assured.
