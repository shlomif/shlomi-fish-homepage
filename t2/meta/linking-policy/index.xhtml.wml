<p>
I don’t believe that restricting linking to any site is ethical, moral, or
holds water. I also don’t want people not to link to the pages I create. To
further this cause, the linking policy of my homesite is the same as
<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/10/04/boing_boing_has_a_li.html">Boing
Boing’s linking policy</a>, which basically says you can link there if your
site does not have a restrictive linking policy.
</p>

<p>
Note that I still approve of requesting inappropriate links to be removed.
If you believe one of the links on this site is doing you damage, then email
me about it and I’ll see what I can do.

<p>
Have fun!
