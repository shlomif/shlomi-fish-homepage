<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>
BertycoX is a French electronic musician, whose recordings used to be featured
on <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/">Jamendo</a> but are no longer
present there for some reason.
I downloaded some of his works, and decided to upload them here for posterity.
I am legally allowed to distribute them because they are Creative Commons.
