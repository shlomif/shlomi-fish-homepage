You should stop using, learning and teaching
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_shell">C-Shell</a> and its
extended <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcsh">Tcsh</a>
implementation, because of their horrible, inconsistent syntax, lack
of usability and the fact that they induce bad habits. The reasons for that
are:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Tom Christiansen (of Perl fame) wrote
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/shell/csh-whynot/">Csh
Considered Harmful</a>, which gives many good arguments for csh’s
inadequacy as a shell scripting language.
<a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/CshTop10.txt">Bruce Barnett’s
“Top Ten Reasons not to use the C shell”</a> gives more convincing arguments,
and illustrates how awful csh is.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a> has real functions (as
well as aliases) instead of just aliases, which are easy to break.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Bash has proper quoting. Handling whitespace in csh is painful. I once
witnessed a pair of <a href="http://www.technion.ac.il/">Technion</a>
students get bogged down writing the solution for
a homework exercise, because they wanted their C-Shell script to handle
whitespaces properly. I later tried the same with bash, and it was trivial to
do.
</p>
</li>

<ol>
<li>
Bash is the default scripting and login shell on Linux.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.kornshell.com/">ksh - the Korn Shell</a>, a Bourne-shell
derivative, is the default login and scripting shell on
non-GNU System V systems.
</li>

<li>
On recent versions of Mac OS X, bash is the default scripting and login shell.
</li>

<li>
Only on the Open Source BSD variants, ash (a slightly enhanced Bourne
shell implementation) is the scripting shell and tcsh is the default login
shell.
</li>

<li>
On cygwin the default shell is bash. <a href="http://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a> is
available for either cygwin or for non-cygwinned win32.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
In all cases, C-Shell is not used for scripting at all, only perhaps for
interactive use. And Bash/ksh/zsh is now often used for both.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
Entire Bash mini-programs can be written, tested and debugged in one line.
This is impossible to do in csh which forces loops to be on separate lines.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Sub-shells and capture-subshells (<code>$(...)</code>) actually work in Bourne
Shell. And Bash actually <b>has</b> capture-subshells which are much safer
than back-ticks (<code>`...`</code>).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The students tend to conclude that C-shell is “The UNIX Shell”. Seeing how
lame C-shell is they tend to believe that the UNIX shell sucks. Which is not
the case for Bash and friends which are beautiful and a joy to work with.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The wrong legacy reasons: many institutions once thought they had to make a
choice between the Bourne shell, sh, which had a sane syntax and
programmability but bad for interactive use, and tcsh which had bad
programmability but with good interactive capabilities.
</p>

<p>
For this generation the choice is clear: bash or zsh that combine both good
programmability and good interactive use. There’s no reason to keep using
tcsh forever.
</p>

</ol>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>

<p>
Instead you should use, learn and teach one of the following shells:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">GNU Bash - the
Bourne-Again-Shell</a> - an extended Bourne-shell-compatible shell, with
good usability. Great for both interactive use and scripting. The default
shell on many systems.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.zsh.org/">Zsh - the Z-shell</a> - the Emacs of shells:
a shell that has everything, including the kitchen sink. Also Bourne-shell
derived.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
There’s also <a href="http://www.kornshell.com/">The Korn Shell</a> which
has lately been open-sourced, but I have never really tried it. It should
be a very decent shell, though.
</p>

<p>
For academic teaching I suggest teaching the common base of these shells,
possibly with some bash extensions.
