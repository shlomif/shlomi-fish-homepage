<p>
When I was in junior high and high school, my classmates and I used electronic hand
calculators (for example: Casio ones, or ones by Sharp) for help with solving mathematics
exercises, or physics ones.
</p>

<p>
One time, a classmate and I solved the same exercise, and reached somewhat,
but clearly, different results. As it turned -out, my friend keyed in some of the
intermediate results from the upper part of the page, where he wrote them rounded
to 2-or-3-or-so precision digits. I, on the other hand, stored these intermediates
in my calculatorâ€™s memory-registers, and recalled them during the next steps (while
writing rounded ones on the page to comply with the exercise).
</p>

<p>
My results were likely more accurate, but <a href="https://github.com/shlomif/Freenode-programming-channel-FAQ/blob/master/FAQ_with_ToC__generated.md#i-am-facing-a-number-of-problems-while-using-floating-point-data-types-eg-float-or-double-is-there-a-explanation-for-this">floating-point calculations have their quirks</a>. Newer hand-calculators have recallable-and-editable history, and there are also full-fledged programming languages (such as Python, or Perl, or Scheme), and <a href="[% base_path %]open-source/resources/numerical-software/#CASes">Computer Algebra Systems (CASes)</a>, which allow assigning to an arbitrary number of variables and recalling their values.
