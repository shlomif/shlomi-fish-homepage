http://unarmed.shlomifish.org/2109.html - “Putting all the Cards on the Table (2013)” (1st public draft)

What is the problem with the Technion and why is it graver in M.I.T., and
why you should watch the film Silver Linings Playbook to realise why it's
not a problem? (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Linings_Playbook ).
Why was the David who fought Goliath a hacker, and what is the difference
between a tragic hero and an action hero? What was the second major battle
that Chuck Norris lost? What are the machines that can give us questions (and
lots of them)? Why not exerting a mental effort will make matters go
from bad to worse? Who was the Jennifer Lawrence of Web 1.0? And what were
my two greatest mistakes, which you should not duplicate?

I got tired of truly intellectual people like me speaking in riddles
all the time and kinda lying to themselves and to others in their artworks,
I decided to put all the cards I have now on the table in a big tour-de-force.
It's not finished yet, but still usable, and there's more to come. Not a
perfect essay, and not for everyone, but imperfect and sweet.
