#include 'template.wml'

<p>
There is another pragma which is called and typed as <tt>use warnings;</tt>,
that causes the interpreter to emit many warnings to the command window in
case you're doing wrong things (like using <tt>undef</tt> in an expression).
It is also very useful to declare it at the beginning of the program, in
addition to  <tt>use strict;</tt>. So, from now on, our programs will
include it as well.
