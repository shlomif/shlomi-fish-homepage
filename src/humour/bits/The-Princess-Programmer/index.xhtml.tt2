<p>
Once upon a time, in a distant kingdom, lived a beautiful princess.
She had beautiful hair. In fact, its colour was your favourite hair colour.
She also had beautiful eyes. Their colour was your favourite eyes’ colour,
even if it is incompatible with your favourite hair colour.
She was kind, noble, passionate, and was loved by her parents, her family,
her friends, and her citizens.
</p>

<p>
As princesses go, she was also an <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Alicorns">alicorn</a>. (All princesses in <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Equestria">Equestria</a> are alicorns, and all alicorns are princesses. Sometimes, it is nice to have more than one word to call members of a certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)">set</a>.)
</p>

<p>
But even beautiful and loved princesses sometimes get bored, or
at least tired of thinking they are so fortunate to be loved and considered
beautiful by many people (which in Equestria are generally animated ponies
and other animals and mythical creatures) and so did the
subject of this tale. So she found a job working as a programmer.
</p>

<p>
She read and wrote source codes in many programming languages, for many
platforms and architectures, and for many employers / clients / commissioners.
But then she ran into a problem. You see: she had to hack on both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl (5)</a> codes and Perl 6 (which would later be renamed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raku_(programming_language)">”Raku”</a>) codes, and found that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo">DuckDuckGo</a> web-search engine had a bias towards yielding Perl 5 results.
</p>

<p>
As a result, the beautiful princess, volunteered to try to help improve DuckDuckGo. One potential improvement path she and her co-workers pursued was to translate its code from Perl 5 to Perl 6. The search-engine with the translated code in general functioned fairly well, but unfortunately exhibited a web-searches' bias towards yielding Perl 6 results.
</p>

<p>
Our Princess Programmer, and many of her fellow Perl 5 / Perl 6 programmers
felt like they were damned either way ( <a
href="[% base_path %]philosophy/computers/your-programming-language-must-suck/">Reference
1</a> ; <a
href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/03/17/martian-headsets/">Reference
2</a> ). But there was a happy ending. First of all, our protagonist and her
software developer friends, discovered and often contributed to more Internet
services: IRC (freenode/etc.), <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange">Stack Exchange</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit">Reddit</a> (and good old Usenet and
mailing lists), GitHub, etc. Moreover, sometimes Google's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">Filter bubble</a> was
advantageous, and it can be accessed using the "!g" bangsearch of DuckDuckGo.
Equesterian ponies do not care too much about Internet services fingerprinting
them because they only have one finger on every hoof, and it has no fingerprint.
They can still use the touch screens of their iPhone-like smartphones though.
