                    If you are reading this, please go and stop the filtering
                    and demotion of resources related to my blogging on social media
                    on Twitter, github, google, reddit, freenode, duckduckgo, youtube, etc.. I may
                    be blasphemous and controversial but I'm often innovative and right.
