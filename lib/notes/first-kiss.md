More impressions from the trip, and this time something that I'd already told in private or semi-private, but I'd like to make more public: my first kiss, with a girl, and on the lips. It happened on the Saturday during which [the convention: (Nine Worlds 2014)](https://nineworlds.co.uk/2014) took place and despite the fact that that girl was almost the exact opposite of what I consider my type, and that I was kinda forced into it ("rape-kissed"), it felt pretty good.

First  of all my type of girls are:

1. White ( [Caucasian race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race) or with Asian / Oriental features, though I admit that I found some Black celebrities very attractive too (e.g:  [Rihanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna) ).

2. Not overly big. Petite is fine, but can also be larger.

3. Muscular, athletic, and without too much excess fat, e.g: ["Athletic Babes" on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Athletic_Babes).

4. An "alpha female": the insurgent, rebellious, independent, "bad girl", awe-inspiring, sexy, exciting, girl, who can get out of any trouble she may get into and keeps challenging social norms. Akin to Wesley Snipes in [here](http://www.ericsink.com/entries/hg_denzel.html) , or [Milady de-Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milady_de_Winter) in [The Three Musketeers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers).

5. Attractive enough and groomed enough.

Do note that per [the story about Nasrudin looking for the perfect woman](https://nice-inspiration.blogspot.com/2011/05/looking-for-perfect-wife.html) only
to realise she was looking for the perfect man, I am quite lenient in
my requirements.

Now on with the story: at the Saturday during the long weekend in which the Nine Worlds GeekFest took place, I decided to walk all the way to a nearby gas station and buy myself a nice drink and a sandwich. I ended up buying a drink, a small wrap package, etc. using my credit card, and I sat down to enjoy them at a nearby bus station.

At that point I was approached by a girl, who looked as in her 20s who was Black, big, fat and with too small a T-shirt so her belly was partly exposed, who told me she needs 10 Â£ to buy some medicine to relieve a headache. She was going to be my first kiss.

Now we tried various ways of getting the money like using the ATM at the gas station with my card, asking the cashiers at the gas station's store to charge my credit card and give us the money, or asking people to use their own credit card. Eventually, I was able to use the ATM machine back at the hotel where the con took place and extract 20 Â£ out of it, and give them to the girl, and she was so happy that she ended up kissing me.

She was too strong (or at least too heavy) to resist, and having recalled what I had written in https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/So-Who-The-Hell-Is-Qoheleth/ongoing-text.html#celts_trip__rape about not resisting getting raped and thus enjoying it better, I did not really resist, and it felt good in a way. (No tongues were involved.).

After the kiss, we went to some trouble to get her to call her family on my mobile phone, but we were able to eventually (I'm still not fluent with operating my new Android-based smartphone).

Anyway, on all the way, I learned more about her like the fact that she was born in the States, and that her father was Jewish, and naturally her given name (which I won't tell here to avoid sharing incriminating details).

We parted way, and I haven't had too much sexual/romantic interest in her to permanently enter into a relationship with her, but I kinda feel that perhaps it was what God (however manifested) intended for me as my first kiss.

## Notes:

I did not try helping that girl in order to kiss her - I helped her because I try
to prioritise helping fellow people. (see https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sarah_Michelle_Gellar&oldid=1002824276#Charitable_activities ; https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Terminator/Liberation/ongoing-text.html#emma-watson-and-the-children-get-icecream  .) The kiss was just a happy side-effect.

I suspect that she was cheating me out of money, but I prefer to err on naivity than on cynicism.

Back in Tel Aviv, a friend of mine joked that 20 GBP was too much to pay for
such a kiss.  She did say, however, that she was moved by reading the story.

While you can call it a "rapekiss", I suspect that many first kisses are like that
despite the mutual kiss popularised by films such as [The Princess Bride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29).

While it felt good, it was not good enough for me to prioritise kissing girls over my
other creative work (which [are often sexualised](https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/featuring_sexy_women_and_girls.xhtml) ).

I tried searching for "shlomi fish" and that girl's given name on google in
February 2021 and didn't find anything relevant.

I think this story uncovered some misfeatures of the financial system.
I happen to think that every legal entity should be able to transfer any
amount of money to any other entity. While money was previously considered
to be a source of power, like the song goes
[Money can't buy me love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srwxJUXPHvE)
(where love is also enthusiasm to spend time, energy, for
[worthy causes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i41qWJ6QjPI)
or acquiring the skills for them.)

So why did I share this story? "It's the law!" ðŸ˜‰ Seriously now: because I found it
interesting and notable.

Will I be Romantically interested in this girl again? If she has lost weight,
and will come to Tel Aviv, then I guess we can go on a few dates to test the
grounds and see if there's a click. I'm not sure if I'm the only geeky guy
with [Messiah-like Meglomania](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs)
and a desire to [make everybody else Messiahs](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-gamedev--make-everyone--messiahs), etc.
she tried to extract money from and kissed. And I do not intend to stay
"loyal" to her (given I had previous
[emotional attractions and "celebrity crushes"](https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/biggest_celeb_crush.xhtml)
and am [attracted to many others](https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/why_are_you_attracted_to_all_these_girls.xhtml).
