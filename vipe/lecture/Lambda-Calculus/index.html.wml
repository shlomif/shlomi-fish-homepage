<latemp_subject "Lecture about Scheme and Lambda Calculus" />

<p>
This is a presentation that introduces 
<a href="http://www.schemers.org/">the Scheme programming language</a>,
and then uses the learned subset to demonstrate Lambda Calculus.
Lambda Calculus is a mathematical model of computation, which only has
two primitives and yet is still quite usable and fun.
