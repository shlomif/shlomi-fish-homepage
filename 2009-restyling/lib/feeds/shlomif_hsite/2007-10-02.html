<!-- TITLE=New Pages Against Bad Software, and Slidy-Shlomif-->
<p>
Here are the new additions on <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi
    Fish's homesite</a> since the last update.
</p>

<p>
Three new pages enumerating problems with bad software are now live:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/csh/">Stop Using
        (and Teaching) C-Shell and Tcsh</a>
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/windows-vista/">Links
        against Windows Vista</a>
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/mysql/">Against 
        MySQL</a>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
I'll appreciate any new additions to these pages.
</p>
