#include 'template.wml'

<p>
The full syntax of the if statement is as follows:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/conditionals/elsif.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
The N-th <code>elsif</code> block will be executed only if all the conditions
in the previous blocks were not met <b>and</b> its own condition was met.
</p>

<p>
You can do the same with nesting <code>if</code> statements inside <code>else</code>
statements, but isn't it nice of perl to save you all those extra brackets
and indentations?
