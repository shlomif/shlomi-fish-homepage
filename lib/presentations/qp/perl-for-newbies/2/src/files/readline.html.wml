#include 'template.wml'

<p>
Just like <tt>print</tt> can be generalised to files, so can the
<tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> which we encountered before. If you place the name of the
filehandle inside the operator, it will read a line from the file opened by
that filehandle.
</p>

<p>
Here's an example, let's append the line numbers to a given file:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/files/line_numbers.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
And the following example counts the number of lines in a file that start with
the letter "A" (case-insensitive).
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/files/line_count.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
The <tt>join("", &lt;FILEHANDLE&gt;)</tt> command returns the entire contents
of the file from the current position onwards, and may prove to be useful.
Examples for it will be given in the next section where regular expressions
will be taught.
