<saying who="joeyadams">lol.  Zuu&#39;s probabilistic, so maybe he can solve you.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">but i guess i have now</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Formal definition of Turing hard:  blah blah blah hard blah blah Turing blah.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">Hahahaha :D</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Wikipedia:   Given a set X in P(N), a set A in N is called Turing hard for X if X &lt;=_T A for all X in X. If additionally A is in X, then A is called Turing complete for X.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Does that clarify?</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_reduction for the actual math symbols)</saying>
<me_is who="joeyadams">assumes you get the point</me_is>
<saying who="Zuu">yeah, i think i&#39;ll have to put significant time into that, for me to comprehend it :)</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">but maybe i will, some day :P</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">My point is that people like to use mumbo jumbo to describe more concise mumbo jumbo.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">E.g. A problem is NP-hard if it is at least as hard as all the problems in NP.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">i undersstand enough of it, to be fairly confident that rindolf being turing hard, will not say much about his ability to be solved</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">I&#39;m guessing Turing-hard means you can&#39;t solve a problem with a Turing machine (e.g. the halting problem)</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">(substitute Turing machine with &quot;your computer&quot; :) )</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">no, turing hard has something to do with expressiveness</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">okay, Zuu &gt; joeyadams, so I can&#39;t help you :)</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">tickles joeyadams ^^</me_is>
<saying who="joeyadams">A delicious apple is any fruit ∈ apple that is at least as tasty as any other fruit ∈ apple.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">In other words, apples are in the set of recursively nommable fruits.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">joeyadams: what&#39;s up?</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">I&#39;m babbling.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">joeyadams: Apple is one of my least favourite fruits.</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">watches a number of apples that recursively NOM&#39;s eathother</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">It tends to be too commonplace.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Or simpleton.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">whoops, my logic is incorrect</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Only delicious apples are ∈ the nommable fruits.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">(recursively is just a word you throw in to sound smart)</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">NOMs joeyadams :&gt;</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">joeyadams: a friend of one of my sisters said that Apple is his favourite fruit.</saying>

<me_is who="joeyadams">has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection nommed by peer))</me_is>
<saying who="Zuu">yeah, unfortunately a lot of people throw with a lot of words to sound smart :/</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">my favourite fruit is a recursive banana!</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">although it certainly helps to use complex terminology to solve complex problems.  As Aristophanes said, &quot;High thoughts must have high language.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">.. along with immutable polymorphic pears</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Zuu&gt; I guess you have to peel it indefinitely?</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">lol</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">Hahah, yeah :P</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">I tend to eat bananas in deterministic polynomial time.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">i eat them in linear time, but uses exponential space</saying>

<saying who="Zuu">Hi rindolf :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Hi Zuu </saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: I&#39;ve been thinking that maybe you can find some corresponding Zuus of the appropriate sex in a different dimension.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">hmmm... interresting!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: are you a heterosexual Zuu or a homosexual one?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">Im not sure what sex I am.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">:P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: you can look.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: in the mirror or something.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: don&#39;t you have obligatory genders in Danish/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Like in German, French, etc.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Or Hebrew and Arabic.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">obligatory genders?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">you mean, the genders in linguistics?</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">never understood those</me_is>
<saying who="Zuu">but Danish have two i believe, and if i remember correctly there is female and &#39;none&#39;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: yes, genders in linguistics.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">i dont remember what which is which though :P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Like in Hebrew &quot;Haben Halakh lagan&quot; - the boy went to the garden. &quot;Habath Halkha lagan&quot; - &quot;The girl went to the garden&quot;</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">That almost sounds like allah akbar</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">rindolf, no we dont distinct between the genders of the subject in the danish language</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">our nouns have genders though</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">zuu-nina?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">like &#39;house&#39; is one gender and &#39;car&#39; is another</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: of course the question is - what language do Zuus speak natively?</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">rindolf: Of course, Zuu speaks Zuu!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuuish?</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">The Zulu population also does not speak Zuluish, just Zulu.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">so if you want to say &#39;the house&#39; its &#39;huse_t_&#39; and if you want to say &#39;the car&#39; its &#39;bile_n_&#39;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">c_sphere: Arnavoth (sounds like an Aztec god) is &quot;Hares&quot; (the Rabbit-like mammal) in Hebrew.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: can you understand Swedish?</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">Aemeth</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">rindolf, some :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">swedish branched from danish afaik</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">same with norwegian</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">yes, Zuu&#39;s speak Zuuish nativley :P</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">is listening to Hans Zimmer - Jack Sparrow</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">Zuuish have few words, all of which is based on words about cake from othre languages :P</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">c_sphere, are you by any chance related to s_cube ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: ah, what do you use the Hebrew word &quot;עוגיה&quot; (= `ugiyah, cookie) for?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">&quot;Chocolate chip pie crust marmalade marzipan cookie yum yum!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">i use it for cookies baked from a hebrew recipe :P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">What does it mean in Zuuish?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">it&#39;s hard to really say something in Zuuish... al you can really do is say something equivalent to &quot;COOKIES!!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">or &quot;YAY CAKE!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">basically, you can only express excitement over different kinds of cakes :P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: do Zuus eat anything except cakes or cookies?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">There was this one time...</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">wait.. no. That was someone else.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Chekov: I disagere with what ESR says in TAOUP that you shouldn&#39;t apply factor optimisations. I think they can make a very large difference.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Chekov: he seems to imply you should wait until computers are fast enough.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Problem is people don&#39;t want to upgrade and if a competing program (maybe a fork ) is much faster, then some of them will switch.</saying>

<saying who="oilio">yeah, I read about it in the wikipedia</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">marzy: Emacs is not a better vim. They are very different.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">marzy: I could never get used to Emacs, but have used Vim for many years.</saying>
<saying who="marzy">rindolf Emacs + Evil mode makes a better vim</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">marzy: does it support all Vim extensions?</saying>
<saying who="marzy">no, that&#39;s why its better. it doesn&#39;t come with retarded scripting language!!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">marzy: well, it&#39;s still not 100% compatible with vim.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">marzy: and Evil is an awful name. Sorry.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">&quot;The only thing more evil than XSLT is XSLT edited with Emacs Evil mode.&quot; ;-)</saying>
<saying who="marzy">i think it&#39;s a good name considering emacs and vi(m) rivalry</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">marzy: of course, I&#39;ve heard worse - coq and coccinelle.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And then there&#39;s this guy here who called his programming language Flua which reminds me of Flu and Influenza.</saying>
<saying who="Reactionary">rindolf: lol</saying>
<saying who="dardevelin">rindolf, flua IDE is not that bad to be fair (at least the little i tried )</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dardevelin: didn&#39;t say *it* was bad - I said the name was bad.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dardevelin: and I could never get it running here. Problems with Py3 and PyQt.</saying>
<saying who="dardevelin">rindolf, oh that sucks... :/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dardevelin: yes.</saying>
<saying who="dardevelin">rindolf, yeah i know you didn&#39;t said it was bad, just as gave you my opinion on it as a side note. sorry i should have made it more explicit :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Of course, Evil is not as bad a name as SLIME, which is another Emacs mode.</saying>
<saying who="dardevelin">rindolf, i had troubles with SLIME once and boy i got tired of fighting with it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Reportedly it was also the nickname of an internal Microsoft version control system called SLM (that is now largely discontinued).</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">codescience: people can sell copies of open source software or services related to it.</saying>
<saying who="codescience">hmmm, i understand</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">codescience: see http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html</saying>
<saying who="ssta">I can legally sell you this copy of the linux kernel...I can charge whaqtever you are willing to pay.  Nothing in the license prevents this</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: will you sell it to me for 5,000 USD?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">;-)</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: sure</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: how about for 3,000 USD?</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: tell you what, for $10,000 I&#39;ll throw in a free copy of FreeBSD</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: wow, sounds like a good deal.</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: hmm, 3000 is a bit low, I don&#39;t think I could go that cheap</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: how much are you selling the source code of Apache 2.4 for?</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: oh, you can have that for free</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: really?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Sucker!</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: sure...but the build scripts you have to pay for</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: would you be willing to exchange the source of the Linux kernel for three copies of jQuery? I will even throw in a few free Dojo plugins.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: he already told us.</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: hmm, not sure I want jQuery</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: would you happen to have code for a halfway decent RDBMS?  I think I could swap for that</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: I have the source code for MySQL. Not sure if it&#39;s half-decent.</saying>
<saying who="codescience">i run a mysql server. runs good enough for me</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: I use MySQL in production quite a lot.  It has its flaws, but my use cases never seem to hit them</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: so will you exchanges its source code for the Linux kernel?</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: sure</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: sounds good.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: you can find the source code of MySQL here - http://www.mysql.com/</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Jude: quite encouraging.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">why</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: what is encouraging?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I mean that some television producers are having a clue about piracy.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I think the MPAA is likely going to follow the lead of the RIAA and endorse the Internet.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: well, there&#39;s still a long way to go with even music online.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Jude++</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: it&#39;s directed at little girls.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: so it&#39;s a pretty clean show.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">yeah I know</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I was kidding</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: if you want incest and violence, then look no further than the Jewish bible.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">there are a lot of dubbing sections of the show to go with metal songs or violent scripts etc</saying>
<saying who="Jude">rindolf, I&#39;m jewish</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: reportedly, it was quite realism then (the Bible I mean).</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: ah, nice. So am I.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">and I couldn&#39;t agree more</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I have to go watch game of thrones</saying>

<saying who="Jude">he&#39;s my brother, he lives close to you and he&#39;s also an open-source enthusaist</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I know</saying>
<saying who="Jude">there are plenty of them</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: ah, that&#39;s great.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I take them to uni on a daily basis</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I live right by rabin sq.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: so you study in TAU?</saying>
<saying who="Jude">yeah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: TAU has tons of hot chicks.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">there are some</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: there aren&#39;t a lot of people on the streets of Gimmel.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: so you study CS?</saying>
<saying who="Jude">no way</saying>
<saying who="Jude">maths</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: ah, I see.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: maths...</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I know one or two nice looking girls, but I usually get put off by their personalities</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I think maths is taught wrong in several aspects.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I&#39;ve only been attracted to one specimen of the female sex ever</saying>
<saying who="Jude">in my entire life</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: ah, really?</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I dunno, I agree when you speak of highschool maths</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I like university maths so far</saying>
<saying who="Jude">my professors are really nice</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: well, there are a lot of girls studying more humane stuff.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: http://blogs.perl.org/users/shlomi_fish/2013/03/ann-my-transition-from-software-developer-to-writerentertaineramateur-philosopherinternet-celebrity.html</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I generally don&#39;t like people who study humane subjects (I don&#39;t consider philosophy to be as such though)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I&#39;ve made a transition from a mathematician to a software developer and now I&#39;m more of a writer/entertainer/amateur-philosopher.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">you didn&#39;t like the way it was taught?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: like which way?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: you mean maths?</saying>
<saying who="Jude">yes</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: well: 1. No pairwise work. Big mistake.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">2. Need to memorise a lot of silly stuff. Why??</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">3. Maybe allow some sloppiness. Make maths more humane.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">that&#39;s why you got philosophy</saying>
<saying who="Jude">maths can&#39;t afford to be sloppy</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">There&#39;s something poetical about many maths&#39; proofs.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">the intuitive ideas behind them</saying>
<saying who="Jude">are beautiful</saying>
<saying who="Jude">but intuition can be misleading</saying>
<saying who="Jude">that&#39;s why you have to be really strict</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: yes, that&#39;s why I think we should now move into proof verifier realm.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">if you want your proof to be valid</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: right.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: but I was once criticised for this - http://ladypine.livejournal.com/24574.html</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: thing is - not everything should be strict when teaching.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I agree that mathematical intuition can be misleading, but it&#39;s still a good thing to have.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: thing is I think many mathematicians now require a lot of dedication and selling their soul to the devil, which is turning them into http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Nemo -s.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">it&#39;s not a very formal proof</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: when I studied EE most of my courses were with open material, and I could do pairwise work, which I enjoyed.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">but seems to hold</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: yes.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I guess you are right</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: :-D</saying>
<saying who="Jude">that the concept is more important than the formalization</saying>
<saying who="Jude">but a lot of my professors agree with you</saying>
<saying who="Jude">and would give much more attention to grasping the important concept, and understanding intuition behind proofs</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I&#39;m always right. Unless I claim that &quot;A is not-A&quot;. But Chuck Norris would be right even then.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">lol</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Hah! A new Chuck Norris factoid.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">&lt;3</saying>
<saying who="Jude">it&#39;s been nice chatting with you, I really have to go now, I need to watch GoT and then go to bed and wake up in 4 hours</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: my father and I now have an ongoing Chuck Norris meme.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: bye, have fun, and good night.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">rindolf, what&#39;s that</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: what?</saying>
<saying who="Jude">the Chuck Norris meme</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: well, we say stuff like &quot;you&#39;re my most Chuck Norris dad.&quot; or &quot;I taught Chuck Norris how to fight.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">It&#39;s a personal running joke.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, a family-wide one.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">We have our own jargon.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">heh</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Most families do.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I&#39;m not close enough to any member of my family</saying>
<saying who="Jude">to do that</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Ah.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">talk to you later, ciao</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Bye.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">rindolf: Douglas Hofstadter gave a talk about how mathematicians aren&#39;t as rigorous as they claim to be</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">and that they use a lot of analogical thinking</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: ah, OK.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">it was at the university of Toronto</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">I missed it sadly though</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: was it filmed?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">but I can basically tell you what he said more or less</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">rindolf: there was a webcast</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">not sure if it can be accessed still</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">&lt;+Nisstyre-laptop&gt; but if you read either GEB or I Am a Strange Loop you&#39;ll get it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: I read GEB.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: GEB was a nice book, but I knew a lot of what he was saying there.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: I still enjoyed the drama stuff in the middle with Achilles, the Tortoise and their friends.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">rindolf: you had the idea of using PM as a metaphor for systems of thinking and the mind?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">because that&#39;s what the book is about</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: PM?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">principia mathematica</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">the formal system constructed by Russell and Whitehead</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: I didn&#39;t think of it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: yes, I know.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">the entire book is his theory of consciousness</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">and how there are levels of thinking</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: well, I read &quot;I think, therefore I laugh&quot; before I read GEB.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">you can be less of a thinking being, etc...</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Yes, he says that consciousness requires thinking in loops, or self-reflection.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, it&#39;s an informal theory of consciousness.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">it requires what he calls a strange loop</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">and there can be many levels to it</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">more levels == what we think of as more human or more conscious beings</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">so PM actually is able to self reflect to an extent</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">although it requires a human to interpret it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I believe, that creating artificial intelligence/artificial consciousness won&#39;t be easy to do, will require a lot of complex code, and will likely be faulty (have its own will, make mistakes, not run as quickly as more specialised code, etc.).</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: yes.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">depends what you mean by AI</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">there are several different definitions</saying>
<saying who="gde33">the first human like robot will be build in japan, the first artifical intelligence in the us</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">heh</saying>
<saying who="gde33">hahaha</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">the church-turing hypothesis would seem to imply it&#39;s possible, at least in principle</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">to create &quot;strong&quot; AI</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">although I intensely dislike that term</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">since it tries to say that any system of thinking that doesn&#39;t work exactly the same as a human one isn&#39;t AI</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">which is BS</saying>
<saying who="gde33">you guys are all worried about intelligence, I think that will be the easy part. Then comes the important stuff: giving it a sense of humor.</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">so there was the idea that consciousness is associated with information flow, and that &quot;more&quot; information flow is &quot;More&quot; consciousness, a continuum like gravity... but gravity can produce a qualitatively different effect past a certain level (black holes..)</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">so the &quot;loop&quot; is where information flow becomes qualitatively different ?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">doomlord: have you read GEB?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">it would be the ability a system has to observe itself, and encode the system itself in the system</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">in otherwords self reflection</saying>
<saying who="gde33">I don&#39;t know many people who can be truly accused of having their own thoughts</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">i dont thinkso but i have some related quotes from somewhere</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">but can a system only approximate itself</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">principia mathematica has that ability</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">can a computer emulate itself...</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">as Goedel showed</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">you can encode formulas in PM as formulas in PM</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">doomlord: yes</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">but to what practical extent</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">what is that supposed to mean?</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">nature has many &#39;feedback loops&#39; involving information</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">physical limitations result in a hard limit of feedback loops</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">whats GEB, links?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">if you point a camera at a mirror eventually it will &quot;stop&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">doomlord: it&#39;s a book</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">Godel, Escher, Bach</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">ah google reveals</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">but the sequel is more clear on what it&#39;s about</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">I Am A Strange Loop</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">ok sounds interestign</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">doomlord: anyway, if you nest implementations of a computer in a computer eventually there will be a limit imposed by the physical situation</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">i.e. the memory and processor speed</saying>
<saying who="gde33">only for limited thinkers</saying>
<saying who="gde33">it&#39;s like entropy, only for people who are afraid to think :P</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">but dont physical systems also have practical limitations</saying>
<saying who="gde33">yes but those are not what we imagine them to be</saying>
<saying who="gde33">if only we knew the meaning of life, that would make things so much easier</saying>
<saying who="Stryyker">how?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I think the whole &quot;AIs spawning AIs&quot; dream is not a good strategy for doing software dev. I think programming is here to stay. It&#39;s not like humans can efficiently do what a dedicated polynomial time program can.</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">even humans get programmed, lol</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">doomlord: yes.</saying>
<saying who="gde33">that new immortality project had some interesting videos</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">doomlord: a large part of human technology is mental.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">doomlord: in fact, we can no longer survive without our mental technology. We couldn&#39;t for thousands of years.</saying>
<saying who="gde33">oh but we can</saying>
<saying who="gde33">just need a favorable environment</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">cultural template = human OS</saying>
<saying who="gde33">not mine</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gde33: you can survive without your mental technology? Even without conceptual thought?</saying>
<saying who="gde33">not sure what you mean</saying>
<saying who="gde33">isn&#39;t that what all the other species do?</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">i saw some TED talk trying to explain the difference between chinese and western spending/saving habits in the way the language encourages people to think about time</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">supposedly chinese language makes it harder to think of past,present,future seperately</saying>
<saying who="gde33">languages can be really weird</saying>
<saying who="gde33">all languages have the word &quot;argument&quot; but some want it to have aditional meanings, I believe in china an argument is equal to disobedience. lol</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">huh?</saying>
<saying who="gde33">in english it is a kind of fight</saying>
<saying who="gde33">争 is a dispute 争论 is an argument or debate</saying>
<saying who="gde33">I cant think of good examples, I used to know a girl who knew many languages</saying>
<saying who="gde33">she showed me how some things are badly broken in some languages</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">is it true japanese can&#39;t say &quot;no&quot;, they have to repeat the question in negative..</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">thats what we were told when learning but they must have a word for no surely</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">doomlord: there is &quot;Hai&quot; for Yes and &quot;iie&quot; for no</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">so its just impolite to say &quot;no&quot; i guess</saying>
<me_is who="Belxjander">is living in Japan</me_is>
<saying who="Belxjander">doomlord: you lose context...</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">doomlord: in English you don&#39;t repeat</saying>
<saying who="gde33">hah no</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">but in Japanese you do</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">gde33: depends on the person... my mother and father thought nothing of explaining politeness to me and will happilly talk overtop me when I am speaking</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gde33: I only know (Modern) Hebrew, English, some mostly forgotten Written Arabic, and some French (which I&#39;m now trying to regain).</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">I have also run into the same from Chinese, Japanese, American, European AND African people I have met</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gde33: well, I also know bits of other languages like Spanish, Russian, German, etc.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gde33: I know that in Hebrew we have compulsive genders for objects, so we don&#39;t care about phrasing sentences in a gender-neutral form, which is an English obsession.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gde33: I think it is parodied in this book - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinny_Legs_and_All_%28novel%29 (great one, BTW - taught me a lot).</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">heh languages with sexism built in.. gender all the way through</saying>
<saying who="gde33">some languages are also more emotional than others</saying>
<saying who="gde33">italians are hilarious</saying>
<saying who="gde33">so much enthusiasm it makes you think something is going on</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">gde33: spoken or written and the correct manner for if you are addressing &quot;up/peer/down&quot; the social ladder with regards respect... yes</saying>
<saying who="gde33">Belxjander: does that apply to many words?</saying>

<saying who="cousteau">jamming all the time, having to remove an accordion-shaped paper each time</saying>
<saying who="cousteau">turns out there was another sheet jammed, but it was hidden and the printer wasn&#39;t detecting it</saying>
<saying who="pulse">i wonder if printers will still jam paper in the year 3000</saying>
<saying who="pulse">maybe it&#39;s a paradox of physics</saying>
<saying who="pulse">a fluke in nature</saying>
<saying who="`Gin">I think its more down to the fact printer companies have been milking their cash cow dry, £10 in R&amp;D each year. etc.</saying>
<saying who="pulse">maybe some day paper will become obsolete, then there will be no problem anymore</saying>
<saying who="`Gin">There are still employees at my job who would prefer to print an email out, read it and then reply to the email.</saying>
<saying who="`Gin">I don&#39;t have much hope for that dream pulse :P</saying>

<saying who="cousteau">the machine rebellion will start with printers, it&#39;s a known fact</saying>
<saying who="koollman">I suppose the equivalent of paper jam with a 3d printer can get really messy</saying>
<saying who="cousteau">heh</saying>
<saying who="koollman">&quot;we cannot access the printer, it is inside a large blob of solidified plastic&quot;</saying>

<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: sorry, I meant that it&#39;s great that svn.php.net is up.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: haha ya. Pretty exciting, might write a short novella about it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">The Svniliion: The trials and tribulations of a programmers journey to get information about php</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">“The day when svn.php.net returned.” -- by olamachon</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: Ah thats it. So much better.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: Hopefully I&#39;ll get like a 10 sec clip in some svn documentary on the history channel</saying>
<saying who="XMPPwocky">rindolf: you *know* that the people working on svn.php had to have an offline backup</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: I like your title too.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: &quot;And it went down, and that is how I knew it was the beginning of the end&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="XMPPwocky">rindolf: because otherwise nobody could remember which way the arguments go for anything</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: “I sulked in my suffering. It was the kind of suffering that tore your heart to shreds. A programmer’s suffering. Nothing could equal it.”</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">XMPPwocky: ya I was thinking about asking my fellow ner... connoisseurs.... if they might have a backup</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: &quot;a lonely life full of 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: I smell the beginning of an organically grown IRC novel</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: this would definitely make a bestseller.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: maybe I&#39;ll prepare a convo log out of it - http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/sharp-programming.html</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">hahahah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: “I remembered the happy days when I was using the svn server back when it was at its prime. Running. Functioning. These days seem so distant now.”</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">LOL.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: &quot;Soon I realized we were at a turning point in a cultural revolution&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: hmm... you can do &quot;better&quot; than that.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/ - I actually wrote some novellas and screenplay-of-sorts here.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: right right, novellas. I was thinking more like I was the glue guy in a documentary</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: So I was trying to be super cliche</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: so was I.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: I like the ironic cliche where it actually means nothing</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: its just all good sounding filler</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">“I looked at the clock on my desktop. Each seconds seemed like a century. What will I do without the svn server online? What can I do? What can I do about it? Who am I asking all these questions?”</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: I wonder where I first read cliches such as that. Maybe it was someone parodying them.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: &quot;Then I had an existential epiphany. What is SVN? What am I? What are we doing in this universe? This foray into the metaphysical was cut short by a brief glance at the clock. It&#39;s 5 o&#39;clock. f**k this s**t, I&#39;m getting drunk.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: do you actually write?</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: never</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: ah, I see.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: is it that obvious? haha</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: you may be a natural.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: I wrote like an essay or two in university, they were like 2 pages haha</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: ah, so little?</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: I read a copious amount of literature</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: ah, OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: OK, I&#39;ll keep this conversation.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: Perhaps that has a prolific effect on my penchant for the perverse verbosity?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: and put it on that page.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: yes, maybe.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: Sure. I feel like we may be getting a bit off-topic here</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: yes, well, svn.php.net is back - that&#39;s what important.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Seize the svn.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Carpe svn!</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: Nice. I see what you did there. I am literally doing that as fast as I can</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, not sure the Latin is right.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">carpe is the seize part</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">&quot;Occupy svn.php.net!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">diem is day</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: yes, I know.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">But maybe svn has to be conjugated.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">oh was carpe diem an idiom?</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">carpe svnus?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Carpe svni?</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">^</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Carpe svna?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Carpe svnis?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Not sure.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">My Latin is weak.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I know the plural of Pentium is Pentia.</saying>
<saying who="pyon">olamachon: &quot;Carpe diem&quot; means something like &quot;live/enjoy this day&quot;</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">pyon: Seize the day</saying>
<saying who="pyon">Yeah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, carpe meant quite a few things.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">In Latin at least.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">This is unbelievably slow. On a 1gbps connection, php docs have been downloading for 15 minutes so far</saying>

<saying who="they">For instance, if you&#39;re making a library called &quot;Jail&quot;, have the top-level folder named &quot;Jail&quot;? So the namespaces below would be &quot;Jail.Whatever&quot;?</saying>

<me_is who="jrslepak">just names a project&#39;s directory based on the name of the project</me_is>

<saying who="rindolf">protist: I realised Sarah Michelle Gellar starred in the same show as Robin Williams. They played a father and daughter.</saying>
<saying who="protist">rindolf: you are obsessed with her :p</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And the father divorced her mother and left her mother to raise her on her own, kinda like SMG in real life.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">protist: I *iz* obsessed with her.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">protist: she was one of my first loves.</saying>
<saying who="protist">rindolf: haha</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">protist: I was recently obsessed with Jennifer Lawrence too - I like the alpha female/insurgent/antagonist/rebel type of girls.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">protist: over at the Technion , I kinda hit on a girl with a nose ring who coloured her hair  black, but she turned out to already have a bf.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">protist: since then I realised I should be more honest and direct and also reduce the round-trip/time-to-market delay.</saying>
<saying who="protist">rindolf: round-trip/time-to-market delay?</saying>
<saying who="protist">rindolf: and a lot of girls will just say they have a boyfriend :p...and sometimes they do it to test you, because oddly they are only interested in a guy who persists in spite of the fake boyfriend</saying>
<saying who="Jck_true">protist: Yeah you might not wanna mention ROI [= &quot;Return On Investment&quot;] when you&#39;re asking a girl on a date...</saying>
<saying who="protist">rindolf: but sometimes it is lack of interest...and sometimes they really do have a boyfriend</saying>
<saying who="protist">Jck_true: what do you mean? :p</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jck_true: heh.</saying>
<saying who="protist">Jck_true: I&#39;m doing the monogamy thing at the moment</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">&quot;What&#39;s your favourite position? CTO!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="pyon">protist: Wouldn&#39;t it be easier to simply say &quot;not interested, bye&quot;?</saying>
<saying who="pyon">protist: I mean, in the case where they aren&#39;t interested.</saying>
<saying who="protist">pyon: When do you ever remember girls being simple?</saying>
<saying who="Jck_true">The Freaking FCC :)</saying>
<saying who="pyon">protist: True that.</saying>
<saying who="protist">pyon: and sometimes they may tell you they have a boyfriend...and actually have one...but will still sleep with you</saying>
<saying who="protist">pyon: they might tell you just so you know that this is supposed to be discrete lol</saying>
<saying who="vendu">pyon, nothing is simple with/about women :D</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Svetlana: I hope you were not too offended by our sex talk or pseudo-sex talk here.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">We&#39;re not sexist - we just play ones in real life.</saying>
<saying who="HikaruBG">Svetlana, what is ffs?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, there&#39;s a difference between sexist and sexualised.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">HikaruBG: &quot;FFS = for fuck&#39;s sake&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="Svetlana">No, I&#39;m not offended at the conversation. I am offended at how lame work I&#39;m doing at setting focus and priorities, though.  I am trying to get mediawiki running but in fact I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a good idea for me to do so or what I would be working on.</saying>
<saying who="HikaruBG">thankd rindolf, i have learned something new today ....  that early in the morning :)</saying>
<saying who="HikaruBG">Svetlana, just take a 15 and step out from the office. Then figure all priorities out.</saying>
<saying who="Svetlana">How do you define &quot;take a 15&quot;?</saying>

            <title>Life According To Valentine</title>
        </meta>
        <irc>
            <body>
<saying who="rindolf">In my imagination, my concept at the time of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar , who was a relatively wild and polyamorous girl (but still an awesome one) decided to duplicate herself and then said &quot;I am going to call my new self &#39;Valentine&#39;&quot;. So she gets duplicated and her duplicate then says &quot;So I&#39;m Valentine, right?&quot;</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">does polyamorous mean a slut?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">njcomsec: well, not exactly.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">njcomsec: thing is - she was very picky about which guys she got involved with. But if she slept with you once, you don&#39;t need to worry about it happening again.</saying>
<saying who="pyon">Is it not possible to have a fixed, small but non-singleton set of romantic partners?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pyon: what does that mean?</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">i wouldnt worry about it :)</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">in fact i would worry she might NOT want to again</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">pyon i believe that is called open relationship</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">i am open to this idea</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">but so far i cant even find one nice girl who will date me</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">so this is the first step</saying>
<saying who="o0elise0o">i have this problem where if i sleep with someone i usually dont want to ever again</saying>
<saying who="njcomsec">thats cute</saying>
<saying who="pyon">rindolf: A singleton set is a set with exactly one element. A small, non-singleton set of romantic partners would be, for example, having two or three romantic partners, but not having sex with arbitrary people.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Also , Miranda Kerr recently bragged about all the great sex she&#39;s been getting with various willing men after being separated from her husband (= Orlando Bloom). I say - all the power to her.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pyon: ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pyon: well, she had a fixed (But often growin or getting reduced) set of those.</saying>
<saying who="pyon">rindolf: Well... if it is often growing or shrinking, it is not fixed.</saying>
<saying who="gde33|2">o0elise0o: try costumes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJgYxWhDDWc</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pyon: ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pyon: well, if her lovers had entered a relationship, she stopped sleeping with them.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pyon: although not permanently.</saying>
<saying who="pyon">rindolf: Ah!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I imagined a short students&#39; film about Valentine Gellar&#39;s life.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">It starts with showing her riding a bus and then there are the immortal words &quot;I used to be Sarah Michelle Gellar&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And Valentine had a steady boyfriend and also studied for a Ph.D. Well, she&#39;s a professor now.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Anyway, at one point she visits her and Sarah&#39;s mother, who admits that while she knows that Valentine is technically her daughter, she causes her so few troubles and is so great, that she has a hard time thinking of her as her daughter - she&#39;s more like a younger friend.</saying>
<saying who="gde33|2">rindolf: you are spoiling the whole movie!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gde33|2: heh, it&#39;s not a real film.</saying>
<saying who="gde33|2">you underacheaver!</saying>
<saying who="gde33|2">I say, make it so</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And then she visits a guy and sees that his room is in disarray and after she queries him for this he says &quot;Ah, yes, Sarah was here last night. We had an awesome time.&quot; So Valentine says: &quot;She couldn&#39;t have been! She stayed up late at a benefit and went to bed past 1 AM exhausted.&quot; . So he thinks for a moment and says: &quot;So it wasn&#39;t her! No biggie.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="KAROLINA">rindolf: are you fluffy?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">KAROLINA: no, I&#39;m Fluttershy.</saying>
<saying who="KAROLINA">rindolf: What is a fluffershy?</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">His owner was also very friendly.</saying>
<saying who="ezrios">a super-calm Rambo eh</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">ezrios: yes , amazing.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ezrios: Rambo was the epitome of a tough all powerful super-muscular anti-geeky warrior/action-hero.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ezrios: but the fact of the matter is that the best combat warriors in the world are: 1. Not very muscular. 2. Geeks.</saying>

<saying who="thecha">ok i will try</saying>
<saying who="thecha">the dog probably ws being agressive because the owners mood was affecting him</saying>
<saying who="thecha">the owner probably was being hostile so the dog followed suit</saying>
<saying who="thecha">and the guy with the kids should have just said the names isntead of being a dick about it</saying>
<saying who="thecha">you go for walks often?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">thecha: yes, I go for walks a lot.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">thecha: yes, this father should learn some things after fatherhood.</saying>

<saying who="xeno">I wish Adventure games (the old style) hadn&#39;t crashed so badly. I like the Telltale Games, but they&#39;ve turned into movies rather than click &amp; point games</saying>
<saying who="xeno">although I just got Broken Sword on my ipad, that seems promising</saying>
<saying who="xeno">but still not anywhere near Lucasarts</saying>
<saying who="xeno">imagine the old lucasart team joining up and making Maniac Mansion III</saying>
<saying who="themachinist">hmm that would be cool. haven’t played MM</saying>
<saying who="xeno">themachinist: MM2 is better known as Day of the Tentacle</saying>
<saying who="xeno">themachinist: and it&#39;s the best adventure games of all time, easily spins circles around both Monkey Island and Sam &amp; Max</saying>
<saying who="themachinist">herecy!</saying>
<saying who="xeno">play it, then say herecy again! it&#39;s insanely good</saying>
<saying who="themachinist">now i have something to do this weekend</saying>
<saying who="xeno">definitely... and unless you cheat, probably longer :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: I prefered the Monkey Islands over Day of the Tentacle.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: and I finished the Day of the Tentacle.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: it&#39;s a good idea not to state an opinion as a fact. :-)</saying>
<saying who="xeno">I would play DotT first, Sam &amp; Max second, Monkey Island II third, not sure about 4th</saying>
<saying who="xeno">rindolf: but it&#39;s a fact that DotT is the best! :)</saying>
<saying who="themachinist">Twey: i think its busybox, not sure how to tell</saying>
<saying who="themachinist">jkbbwr: ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: &quot;In my opinion, it&#39;s a fact!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="xeno">rindolf: exactly!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: stop! You don&#39;t exist! You cannot have opinions.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: I am not -&gt; I think not.</saying>
<saying who="xeno">rindolf: you don&#39;t need to exist or to think for DotT to be the best adventure game :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: you cannot have opinions and you certainly cannot state facts.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: DotT does not exist! Thus, it can not be played.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: the Matrix HAZ YOU!</saying>
<saying who="xeno">rindolf: of course the matrix has me</saying>
<saying who="xeno">or I have the matrix</saying>
<saying who="xeno">or maybe I am the matrix</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: in which cell? ;-)</saying>
<saying who="xeno">#9, the one with the soft fluffy walls</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: a matrix is two-dimensional.</saying>
<saying who="xeno">only inside the matrix</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: maybe an Evil Genius convinced us that matrices are a valid mathematical concept.</saying>
<saying who="Twey">Matrices are just a special case of tensors.</saying>
<saying who="xeno">rindolf: that&#39;s likely, but you don&#39;t even need that... the Evil Genius argument is just Descartes being incapable of imagining himself as not created by something conscious</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Twey: &quot;Flobakonins are just a special case of loremipsums.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Twey">rindolf: Gesundheit!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Twey: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: i agree that reality can be very different from what we perceive it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">xeno: assuming powerful enough misconceptionists.</saying>

<me_is who="pulse">packs a rifle</me_is>
<saying who="pulse">pesky carrots, won&#39;t get away from me this time</saying>
<saying who="PlanckWalk">If you eat cats, then you&#39;ll be reducing the amount of meat eaten in the world.</saying>
<saying who="adsc">shotgunning the ground is a surprisingly effective way to reveal the treasures that lie within</saying>
<saying who="pulse">PlanckWalk, that&#39;s paradoxical. i&#39;ll be eating meat so i&#39;ll be increasing it</saying>
<saying who="PlanckWalk">But you&#39;ll be reducing the meat that would otherwise be eaten by those cats in their life!</saying>
<saying who="pulse">ah.</saying>
<saying who="pulse">i don&#39;t mind cats eating meat</saying>
<saying who="adsc">and he&#39;ll increase the corn that&#39;s eaten by mice</saying>
<saying who="adsc">which increases world hunger</saying>
<saying who="adsc">so it&#39;s bad to eat cats</saying>
<saying who="adsc">better eat dogs</saying>
<saying who="adsc">they are useless</saying>
<saying who="adsc">although I guess they to have a positive impact on sales of the shoe industry</saying>
<saying who="adsc">so maybe it&#39;s not good to eat dogs either, or the shoe industry will falter</saying>
<saying who="pulse">now i&#39;m not hungry anymore</saying>
<saying who="pulse">so this chat was somewhat beneficial</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">DrIranian: can I take one of your &quot;i&quot;s?</saying>
<me_is who="DrIranian">agrees after long consideration</me_is>
<me_is who="rindolf">takes one of DrIranian &#39;s &quot;i&quot; and colours it hot pink.</me_is>
<saying who="iwanttobreakfree">how old were you when you first started programming? i was 15-16</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">iwanttobreakfree: I was about 10.</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">:D</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">iwanttobreakfree: I wrote in XT BIOS BASIC.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">iwanttobreakfree: what did you write in?</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">rindolf: Girls calling me housewife, asking me for cooking advice, and now you paint my i pink :D</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">iwanttobreakfree: what makes you think that?</saying>
<saying who="iwanttobreakfree">dunno</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">I have a book on Pascal that I&#39;ve never actually read.</saying>
<saying who="iwanttobreakfree">it seemed to simple?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">iwanttobreakfree: and IQ is a silly measurement of intelligence not to say competence and performance.</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">IQ is good for a basic measurement</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">I once passed an IQ test.</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">&gt; 60 is passing, right?</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">:(</saying>
<saying who="iwanttobreakfree">actually you can have super high competence, but when you don&#39;t want to do the job, then it doesn&#39;t count</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">105 is passing</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">vdamewood: if you can turn on IRC, you probably have 105</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">isn&#39;t the average IQ 90?</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">rindolf: 100</saying>
<saying who="Serpentine_">Values below a small threshold deviating from 100 are generally very inaccurate</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">DrIranian: &quot;turn on IRC&quot;?</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">rindolf: The same IQ in different countries is not the same</saying>
<saying who="Serpentine_">100 points is defined as the mean and median in IQ tests</saying>
<saying who="Zeno`">no wonder people are so stupid</saying>
<me_is who="vdamewood">passed Zeno` the state-sponsored happy pills.</me_is>

<saying who="DrIranian">I want pink bile</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vdamewood: so it will match the colour of DrIranian &#39;s &quot;i&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">rindolf: Your only other choices are blood and phlegm</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">I can give you a mixture of 1 parts blood, 5 parts phlegm</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vdamewood: that&#39;s OK, I still have a lot of hot pink paint left to colour that bile.</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">vdamewood: those are the standard options, we are talking about tuning the fluids</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">LOL.</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">Wtf is happening.</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">`echo &#39;a&#39; &gt; Foo`</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">Then reading it in, say, Haskell and Java, it&#39;s &quot;a\n&quot;</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">not sure how portable -n is.</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">rindolf: Oh, I see.</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">IIRC --&gt; In internet-relay chat</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">rindolf: That doesn&#39;t explain why vim and nano also saves that way though.</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">Because vim and nano assume you want a new line at the end of your text file.</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">vdamewood: I see.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Myrl-saki: it&#39;s a configuration option.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Myrl-saki: kate doesn&#39;t do it by default.</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">vdamewood: Why though?</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">colours the newline hot pink.</me_is>
<saying who="vdamewood">Because they&#39;re text files.</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">vdamewood: What&#39;s the benefit of such?</saying>
<saying who="iwanttobreakfree">guys i have a genius idea: to make a programming language which supports all syntaxes ( func. programming, logic programming, OOP, etc)</saying>
<saying who="Myrl-saki">iwanttobreakfree: lol</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Myrl-saki: for once cat $file works nicer.</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">iwanttobreakfree: C++?</saying>
<saying who="DrIranian">iwanttobreakfree: is this back in the future?</saying>

<me_is who="rindolf">colours 10 of these cents hot pink.</me_is>
<me_is who="vdamewood">pats Archer on the head.</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">iwanttobreakfree: we have a saying in Hebrew : &quot;Catch a lot - didn&#39;t catch anything&quot;</saying>
<saying who="vdamewood">Looks like 60 seconds are up.</saying>
<saying who="iwanttobreakfree">such a approach would result a highly effective program code and it would save thousands of human lives and it&#39;s a work of a lifetime for some people.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">iwanttobreakfree: also, reportedly Linus Torvalds once said that his primary responsibility as the chief developer of the Linux kernel is to say &quot;No.&quot;.</saying>

<saying who="SillyMusings">How much money can I expect to make as a developer out of college?</saying>
<saying who="quelqun_dautre">SillyMusings: 0$. Tax deduced.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">quelqun_dautre: well, that&#39;s a lower bound.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">SillyMusings: the correct answer is that it varies based on several parameters.</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">rindolf, what are the parameters?</saying>
<saying who="quelqun_dautre">what you know, what framework you can use, how good you are in an interview, where you are</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">SillyMusings: 1. Where are you located. 2. Which languages do you know. 3. where you&#39;ll get hired.</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">I know Javascript and Java</saying>
<saying who="quelqun_dautre">where are you located ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">SillyMusings: it&#39;s spelled &quot;JavaScript&quot; - not &quot;Javascript&quot;</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">I am located in Oregon</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">how much money you&#39;ll make is not a function of any of those inputs.</saying>
<saying who="quelqun_dautre">and how good are you at Java[script] ?</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">sad to say it&#39;s barely a function at all. predictability in terms of actual earnings is impossible these days.</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">I&#39;d say I&#39;m okay at it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">quelqun_dautre: Java and JavaScript are two completely different things.</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">if you want some examples, look at GlassDoor.</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">What sort of range am I looking at?</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">SillyMusings: GlassDoor.</saying>
<saying who="quelqun_dautre">rindolf: I know.</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">SillyMusings: anything from us will be an incomplete picture.</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">SillyMusings: so draw from multiple sources.</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">If I&#39;m fresh out of college, am I a &#39;junior developer&#39;?</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">probably. god knows what you&#39;ll be placed into.</saying>
<saying who="quelqun_dautre">SillyMusings: what is &quot;okay&quot; on your terms ? Do you know the play framework ? J2EE ?</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">SillyMusings: I certainly hope you aren&#39;t expecting a lot of money.</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">quelqun_dautre, no I&#39;m stronger on the JS side</saying>
<saying who="pilne">java and javascript are often used in the same &quot;completed&quot; project these days, but they are completely different beasts for better or worse</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">little_bit, glassdoor says average of 103k?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">quelqun_dautre: http://stackoverflow.com/a/245073 - case in point. ;-)</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">SillyMusings: for what position?</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">and where?</saying>
<saying who="pilne">javascript is relatively strong right now due to node.js, it isn&#39;t ideal for *everything* but it can do a lot</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">thinks serving Java web applets from a Node.js service is bestest</me_is>
<saying who="TubbyTommy">JavaScript is relatively strong on it&#39;s own because they keep making it better, its not ever finished really</saying>
<saying who="SillyMusings">yes I&#39;ve been following es6 stuff</saying>
<saying who="pilne">erm... rindolf?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pilne: that was a joke! Relax!</saying>
<saying who="pilne">yeah, but it is starting to add cruft</saying>
<saying who="quelqun_dautre">SillyMusings: what do you know in JS ? What library can you use ? Ever used functional programming ? Do you know what a closure is ?</saying>
<saying who="pilne">LOL i would hope so rindolf, that isn&#39;t impossible, i just can&#39;t see why you&#39;d do it other than being a code-massochist</saying>
<saying who="little_bit">SillyMusings: I&#39;m going to assume you&#39;re fresh out of college, so let me make this clear: you&#39;re not getting those jobs.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pilne: use the wrong tool for the job! ;-)</saying>
