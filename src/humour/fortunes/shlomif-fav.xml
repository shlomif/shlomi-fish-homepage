                    An algebra teacher is discussing a problem with a student.
                    The teacher says: "Now, suppose x is the speed at which the
                    train is travelling…".  And the student says "But teacher,
                    what if x is not the speed at which the train is
                    travelling?"

                    <p> Personally, I'd have a far better time writing scripts
                        if I had some more creative shells to script in…</p>

                    <p> ASMsh: The Assembly shell. Commands include MOV, SHL,
                        SHR, JNE, etc.  </p>

                    <p> shellTM: Turing machine shell. Only four commands.
                        Read, write, move left, move right. Capable of
                        producing any programming language imaginable, given
                        enough time and nerves of steel.  </p>

                    <p> GeneSH: Four commands. G, A, T, C. Need I say more?
                    </p>

                    <p> Qsh: Only uses one environment variable, which contains
                        all possible values simultaneously. Method of
                        scripting: isolate the universe in which the desired
                        result is already accomplished, and intersect with it.
                    </p>

                    <p> Of course, I never said they'd be easy to use. But
                        then, if these shells existed, and I knew a sysadmin
                        who used any of them, you can believe Sysadmin Day
                        would be a far more celebrated holiday.  </p>

                        In fact, I think Linus's [= Linus Torvalds'] cleverest and most consequential
                        hack was not the construction of the Linux kernel itself, but rather his
                        invention of the Linux development model.  When I expressed this
                        opinion in his presence once, he smiled and quietly repeated something
                        he has often said: "I'm basically a very lazy person who likes to get
                        credit for things other people actually do."  Lazy like a fox.  Or,
                        as Robert Heinlein famously wrote of one of his characters, too lazy
                        to fail.

                        The dictionary definition of capitalism is: An economic system characterized
                        by private ownership of capital goods and by investments that are determined
                        by private decision rather than by state control. Prices, production and
                        distribution of goods are determined by a free market.

                        …
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But most writers and commentators put dishonest altruistic-platonistic
                        connotations on the meaning of capitalism: A system of exploitation of the
                        weak by the strong -- devoid of love and good will. A system in which
                        unwanted goods and services are pushed onto consumers through clever,
                        deceptive advertising for the sole purpose of profits and greed. Capitalism
                        dominates most Western governments. Capitalism, big business, and fascism
                        are synonymous.

                        Yet, acting on fully integrated honesty (Neo-Tech), not reason itself, is
                        the basic moral act. When Genghis Khan, for example, chose to use reasoning
                        for a specific military move, then in an out-of-context sense, he chose to
                        act morally by protecting himself and his troops (thus filling human
                        biological needs). But in the larger sense of fully integrated honesty,
                        Khan's total actions were grossly immoral in choosing to use aggressive
                        force in becoming a mass murderer (thus negating human biological needs).
                        The highly destructive, irrational immorality of Genghis Khan's overall
                        dictatorial military actions far outweighed any narrow, out-of-context
                        "moral" actions. …Genghis Khan was enormously evil as were Stalin, Hitler,
                        Mao, Castro, Pol Pot.

                    <p>
                        Why are there so many unmaintainable applications written in PHP and Perl?
                        Because PHP and Perl let undisciplined, inexperienced programmers write
                        useful code. So does Ruby -- but give it the popularity and longevity of PHP
                        and Perl (at least in English-speaking circles) and I bet you'll see plenty
                        of bad code written in Ruby too.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This seems like a variant of the Hackers and Painters fallacy. (Paul Graham
                        is rich. Paul Graham writes Lisp. Therefore everyone who writes Lisp will
                        get rich.) "All of the good, smart programmers I know are using Ruby. They
                        write good code. Therefore you can't write bad code in Ruby!"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It feels like there's another fallacy in there somewhere. I want to call it
                        the Pre-Post-Java Blindspot, where Java was the beginning of Serious
                        Programming Languages and only its successor will unseat it. (Like any good
                        fallacy, you have to ignore history, such as the fact that Ruby's between 10
                        and 12 years old.)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        (I mean, if you really just can't read regular expressions, why not admit
                        it? You could start a twelve-step program or something.)

                        Much of the relative simplicity of Java is - like for most new languages -
                        partly an illusion and partly a function of its incompleteness. As time
                        passes, Java will grow significantly in size and complexity. It will double
                        or triple in size and grow implementation-dependent extensions or libraries.
                        That is the way every commercially successful language has developed. Just
                        look at any language you consider successful on a large scale. I know of no
                        exceptions, and there are good reasons for this phenomenon. [I wrote this

                        In yesterday's post (Bitten by the Enterprise Bug), we learned how vital
                        enterprise application are for proactive organizations leveraging collective
                        synergy to think outside the box and formulate their key objectives into a
                        win-win game plan with a quality-driven approach that focuses on empowering key
                        players to drive-up their core competencies and increase expectations with an
                        all-around initiative to drive up the bottom-line.

                        &gt;That's the nice thing about UNIX, it gives you so many
                        &gt;ways to shoot yourself in the foot.  :)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At least it does allow you to shoot yourself in the foot.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It doesn't say "shooting feet isn't supported"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Or you can shoot yourself in the foot by writing a
                        management console plugin that will pass the data to
                        Word using VBA and then call Excel via com to split it
                        into columns and then write an activeX control to get
                        the columns back as

                        You should learn several new words everyday--eventually you will forget how to
                        speak so others can understand you.

                        For thousands of years, we have been plagued by mathematicians insisting that
                        two plus two equals four. Who elected them? I, Stevie-O, am promoting an
                        entirely new system, where two plus two equals FIVE. Eventually, it will be
                        extended to provide other stuff these power-hungry madmen kept hidden away for
                        themselves, such as division by zero, cold fusion, the ability to solve the
                        halting problem, and the secret to attracting hot chicks.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Absolutely not.  Perl supports defunct operating systems, buggy
                        operating systems, commercial operating systems, and poorly marketed
                        operating systems.  It would be inappropriate to drop SCO just
                        because it happens to be all of the above.

                        Recently, Richard Stallman gave a speech in which he illustrated an academic
                        point about programming history by quoting a guy who described vi as 'an editor
                        spread at sword-point and which is really hard to use'.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I think I speak for all moderate vi(m) users when I say -- DEATH and DAMNATION
                        (in that order) to this Cardinal of the CTRL key! Needless to say my own local
                        vim user group has dispatched assassins to kill Mr. Stallman, but this is
                        hardly the end of the story. The fact is that a man has referred to another man
                        who in turn expressed some often-voiced reservations about OUR EDITOR! On
                        behalf of all editors of text everywhere, I implore EMACS users to return to
                        the true path, lest you be burned at the stake and then go to hell, the Buffer
                        From Which There Is No Unloading. We'll see how productive you are then, with
                        your ctrl-meta-alt and your ELISP and your 'ring buffer', whatever THAT is.

                        The thing is, I don't actually enjoy debugging my own machines. I _much_
                        prefer having other people debug _their_ machines, and fixing my machine
                        in the process. So I didn't want just something that worked on the Mac
                        Mini, I wanted something that works _universally_, so that hopefully
                        people who are even crazier than me will waste _their_ time trying to get
                        these machines working.

                    <p>
                        First, they came for the newspapers, and I did nothing because the Farsi Side
                        comic was just re-prints now.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next, they came for the books, and I looked the other way because the Death to
                        America Book of the Month Club was only recommending books to burn anyway.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then, they came for the Satellite Dishes, and I said nothing because I still
                        had a year left on my Infidelphia Cable contract.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, they came for my Internet Service, and no one was left
                        to hear my ululation!

                        I don't guarantee that I always change my mind, but I _can_ guarantee that if
                        most of the people I trust tell me I'm a dick-head, I'll at least give it a
                        passing thought.

                        I'm at the ABs, and I still can't get a grip on the plot. Characters enter, are
                        introduced in exhausting detail -- and then disappear again! Very frustrating.
                        The only time an old character shows up again is in another's history! A lot
                        like _A Dance to the Music of Time_, I suppose.

                        Perhaps things will become clearer when we meet Oxford, English or Dictionary
                        -- clearly three key figures. Some kind of menage a trois?

                        Although the contents of her book, The Virtue of Selfishness, are precisely
                        accurate and widely integrated, Ayn Rand committed an error by distorting the
                        word "selfishness" in fashioning a dramatic statement. The word "selfishness"
                        does have valuable, precise denotations of "an irrational, harmful disregard
                        for others". Rand could have strengthened her work by selecting accurate
                        wording such as rational self-growth. Instead, she unnecessarily bent and
                        undermined the precise, valuable meaning of selfishness. …As with
                        selflessness, selfishness is a form of immature, destructive, irrational
                        behavior -- a form of stupid behavior.

                        Did you watch Uri Geller's show last night? He said that if anything
                        extraordinary happened at home during the show, people should phone in, or
                        report it at his website. During the entire show I was installing Hebrew
                        Windows XP for my mother-in-law, and something extraordinary did happen. The
                        operating system got installed, came up, ran without a glitch. Should I report
                        this to Uri?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Without a glitch, huh? Apparently you (and Uri) managed to install Linux from a
                        Windows XP installation CD. This is much more than telekinesis. It smells like
                        pure alien intervention. Report immediately!

                        It's one of those rare "perfect" kernels. So if it doesn't
                        happen to compile with your config (or it does compile, but then does
                        unspeakable acts of perversion with your pet dachshund), you can rest easy
                        knowing that it's all your own d*mn fault, and you should just fix your
                        evil ways.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You could send me and the kernel mailing list a note about it anyway, of
                        course. (And perhaps pictures, if your dachshund is involved. Not that
                        we'd be interested, of course. No. Just so that we'd know to avoid it next
                        time).

                <title>Linus Torvalds: Releasing Kernel 2.6.20 on Superbowl Sunday</title>
            </meta>
            <quote>
                <body>
                    <p>
                        In a widely anticipated move, Linux "headcase" Torvalds today announced
                        the immediate availability of the most advanced Linux kernel to date,
                        version 2.6.20.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Before downloading the actual new kernel, most avid kernel hackers have
                        been involved in a 2-hour pre-kernel-compilation count-down, with some
                        even spending the preceding week doing typing exercises and reciting PI
                        to a thousand decimal places.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The half-time entertainment is provided by randomly inserted trivial
                        syntax errors that nerds are expected to fix at home before completing
                        the compile, but most people actually seem to mostly enjoy watching the
                        compile warnings, sponsored by Anheuser-Busch, scroll past.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As ICD head analyst Walter Dickweed put it: "Releasing a new kernel on
                        Superbowl Sunday means that the important 'pasty white nerd'
                        constituency finally has something to do while the rest of the country
                        sits comatose in front of their 65" plasma screens".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Walter was immediately attacked for his racist and insensitive remarks
                        by Geeks without Borders representative Marilyn vos Savant, who pointed
                        out that not all of their members are either pasty nor white.  "Some of
                        them even shower!" she added, claiming that the constant stereotyping
                        hurts nerds' standing in society.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Geeks outside the US were just confused about the whole issue, and were
                        heard wondering what the big hoopla was all about. Some of the more
                        culturally aware of them were heard snickering about balls that weren't
                        even round.
                    </p>

                        A nice flame war. I'm just going to sit back, crack a beer and enjoy it.
                        It is almost memorial day weekend, you know. Hopefully it get hot enough
                        in here to roast a hot dog.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Oh goody! I'll help get things going:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            * MySQL users will have to wait until you are done with the fire before they
                            can roast their hot dogs, since MySQL is not a real database and does not
                            support concurrent roasting;
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            * I've read the PostgreSQL manual eight times and still can't figure out
                            something as bloody simple as roasting a hot dog, though I did figure out I
                            have to call VACUUM before I can apply ketchup;
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            * Serious enterprises who care about their hot dogs use Oracle, since you can
                            roast over 10,000 dogs at once and optionally impart the taste of filet mignon;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            * If you try to roast a footlong hotdog using MySQL it will silently truncate
                            it to regular size, causing your child to cry;
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            * Oracle will sue you if you complain about the difficulty of
                            starting your fire or the blackened taste of the dogs;
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            * With SQLite your hot dogs are pre-roasted;
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            * Last year on Memorial Day, mysqld leapt out of my MacBook Pro and pushed my
                            cousin into the fire, resulting in third degree burns. And also it causes
                            cancer. And terrorism. Blindness. Violent puppy death. BOO! MYSQL IS SCARY
                            DON'T USE MYSQL!!
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        "Yeah, but at least he made the Kernel -- Gates just made the Basic compiler"

                        BSD"

                    <p>
                        "Screw Linus -- he was wrong about BitKeeper and Tivo so he's wrong about MS &amp;
                        Novell"

                    <p>
                        "Yeah, well at least he's not a convicted monopolist"

                    <p>
                        Also insert random quotes and mis-quotes such as:
                        "When Microsoft writes an application for Linux, I've Won." - Linus Torvalds
                        "640kb ought to be enough for everybody" - Bill Gates

                        That about cover it? Can we have a non-childish discussion now? If there's any
                        other slime to be thrown, just reply to this post -- let's keep the forum clean
                        for an actual discussion.

                    <p>
                        Poetical sing-song or hypnotically rhythmic meter are often found in the
                        rhetoric of dictators, evangelists, sibyls, politicians, theologians,
                        mountebanks, social "intellectuals", media men, medicine men, hallucinating
                        psychotics, chanting shiites, and screaming terrorists. Consider how millions
                        of normally rational Germans thrilled and responded to the poetical cadence and
                        charisma of the consummate altruist neocheater, Adolph Hitler. The results: a
                        reign of destruction with tens of millions of human beings slaughtered so one
                        impotent man could indulge his mysticism to feel unearned power. All that
                        slaughter was for nothing more than to let one neocheater feel a pseudo
                        self-esteem. …Twenty million dead so one pip-squeak could feel big and
                        important.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "So what!" cry the mystics as the lifetime efforts of a thousand productive,
                        innocent individuals are blown to bits every day without a backward glance. So
                        what if the troops roll across the country with military cadence and guns
                        ablaze. So what if they level town after town, reducing to rubble and corpses
                        all the values, beauty, and life that took generations of productive effort to
                        build.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And that is all the chanting religious automatons or splendid Panzer divisions
                        know how to do -- to destroy in a moment, without a thought, all the values
                        that producers labored for lifetimes to build. Chanting mobs or marching troops
                        never glance back, never think for a moment of the death and destruction they
                        leave behind. So what! the mystics and neocheaters cry. So what if genocide
                        happens in Russia, Nazi Germany, Cuba, Cambodia, Red China, or in our land. "I
                        don't want to hear it! To hell with the lifetime efforts of productive
                        individuals! …Save the snail darter!"
                    </p>

Somebody who is presenting to shareholders knows how to change the

                    </p>

                        "They felt Jesus would not have approved of copyright breaches."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Jesus, you da man! Stick it to those kids!
                    </p>

                    <p> You might be interested to note that the students had
                        studied "Exodus 20:15 - you shall not steal" which
                        comes a little way before Jesus anyway. Wasn't the
                        whole point of Jesus coming to make the "new
                        commandment" that people "love one another as I have
                        loved you" and to annul the previous commandments that
                        were given to Moses? I was raised Christian and was
                        Christian for a long time but now am not, but I can't
                        quite remember the specifics of this point.  </p>

                    <p> Anyway, the point is that Jesus probably would have
                        told them to stick Exodus to the man and just get on
                        with the lovin'. Or something.  </p>

                            the speed and efficiency by compiling it to .NET
                            interpreted pseudocode instead. Microsoft has such

                        <p> What’s there not to like with C++/CLI? You
                            can have macros expanding to templates from which
                            generics are generated, and then have classes
                            generated from the generics. And these classes can
                            have a close function and two destructors, and hold
                            references to unmanaged pointers to managed
                            pointers!  With C++, you only have duplicate
                            features, but with C++/CLI, you can finally have
                            triplicate ones! You see, this is a language for an
                            expert. Experts love having 3 different ways to do
                            things, each broken in its own way.  </p>

                        completely inseparable from the desktop and that the

                        uninstalled. Just like IE is.</p>

                    <p> Apart from the fact that I congratulate you for writing
                        bugless software without peer review, I also
                        congratulate you for being able to write a fully RFC
                        compliant MLM that won't blow up when you receive input
                        you didn't account for.  </p>

                    <p> Quite frankly, even a crappy sysadmin can get a
                        reasonable mailman setup working (including nice
                        archiving), quicker than the best coder can rewrite a
                        full MLM from scratch.  And you still have time left
                        over to modify/fix/improve mailman to do the few things
                        it didn't do quite right for you.  </p>

                    <p> But if your attitude to coding is "I'd rather rewrite
                        all this than soiling my eyes and hands looking at
                        someone else's code", that's not a very good way to get
                        hired anywhere as a coder, and even if you are super
                        brilliant, you end up being a DJB that people snicker
                        at with "that guy thinks he's so bright that he had to
                        write his own libc" (instead of fixing/wrapping the few
                        problematic pieces of them, and in the case of
                        reasonable maintainers, contributing the code back).

                    <p> Among the generalists, the conventional wisdom is that
                        the worse-is-better approach is more adaptive.
                        Personally, I get a little tired of the argument: My
                        worse-is-better is better than your worse-is-better
                        because I'm better at being worser! Is it really true
                        that the worse-is-better approach always wins? With
                        Perl 6 we're trying to sneak one better-is-better cycle
                        in there and hope to come out ahead before reverting to
                        the tried and true worse-is-better approach.  Whether
                        that works, only time will tell.  </p>

                        The regression list keeps shrinking, so we're still on track for a full
                        2.6.24 release in early January. Assuming we don't all overeat during the
                        holidays and nobody gets any work done. But we all know that the holidays
                        are really the time when we get away from the boring "real work", and can
                        spend 24/7 on kernel hacking instead, right?

                    <p>
                        Xeno's paradox is easily disproved in three steps:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Get crossbow and bolt.</li>
                        <li>Aim crossbow at Xeno.</li>
                        <li>Fire.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        If the bolt moves to Xeno, then it is proved that movement is possible. Also,
                        Xeno will be dead. Win win situation.

                        I thought I had done some rather horrible things with gcc built-ins and

                        As my daughter would say: that patch fell out of the ugly tree, and hit
                        every branch on the way down. Very impressive.

                        Are you saying that this linux can run on a computer without windows underneath
                        it, at all ? As in, without a boot disk, without any drivers, and without any
                        services ?
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        That sounds preposterous to me.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If it were true (and I doubt it), then companies would be selling computers
                        without a windows. This clearly is not happening, so there must be some error
                        in your calculations. I hope you realise that windows is more than just Office
                        ? Its a whole system that runs the computer from start to finish, and that is a
                        very difficult thing to acheive. A lot of people dont realise this.

                        Microsoft just spent $9 billion and many years to create Vista, so it does not
                        sound reasonable that some new alternative could just snap into existence
                        overnight like that. It would take billions of dollars and a massive effort to
                        achieve. IBM tried, and spent a huge amount of money developing OS/2 but could
                        never keep up with Windows. Apple tried to create their own system for years,
                        but finally gave up recently and moved to Intel and Microsoft.

                        Its just not possible that a freeware like the Linux could be extended to the
                        point where it runs the entire computer fron start to finish, without using
                        some of the more critical parts of windows. Not possible.

                        Linux Genuine Advantage™ is an exciting and mandatory new way for you to place
                        your computer under the remote control of an untrusted third party!
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        According to an independent study conducted by some scientists, many users of
                        Linux are running non-Genuine versions of their operating system. This puts
                        them at the disadvantage of having their computers work normally, without
                        periodically phoning home unannounced to see if it's OK for their computer to
                        continue functioning. These users are also missing out on the Advantage of
                        paying ongoing licensing fees to ensure their computer keeps operating
                        properly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To remedy this, we have created a new program available as a required free
                        download: Linux Genuine Advantage™!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally! Linux users can experience a feature that until now remained the
                        exclusive domain of proprietary software.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once you've installed Linux Genuine Advantage™, you'll want to register and
                        send in your licensing fees to receive these important benefits:
                    </p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>
                            Your computer, which worked just fine before, will continue functioning
                            normally!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Our software which you just installed will not disable logins on your
                            computer (as long as our license server keeps working properly)!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It's totally awesome!  We might not raise the yearly licensing fees in the
                            future!
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Plus, if you act now, we promise not to launch unfounded lawsuits against you,
                        slander you or our competitors in the press and the courts (possibly by using
                        other smaller companies as pawns), or require you to pay us for software you

                        any Windows machines as pirated during Microsoft's server outage. Meanwhile,
                        the Linux Genuine Advantage™ activation server was up the whole time. Truly
                        another victory for Open Source software! Microsoft, contact us if you'd like
                        to license Linux Genuine Advantage™, we'd love to enter into a lucrative
                        licensing agreement. With the money you save, you could put the WGA programmers
                        onto other tasks, like improving Vista!

                        If you were a Unix programmer you either programmed in C or shell. And there
                        really wasn't much in between. There were these little languages that we used
                        on top of shell, but that was the big divide. The big revelation that hatched
                        Perl, as it were, was that this opened up into a two-dimensional space. And C
                        was good at something I like to call manipulexity, that is the manipulation of
                        complex things. While shell was good at something else which I call
                        whipuptitude, the aptitude for whipping things up.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So Perl was hatched. As a small egg. That was Perl 1. And it was designed from
                        the very beginning to evolve. The fact that we put sigils in front of the
                        variables meant that the namespaces were protected from new keywords. And that
                        was intentional, so we could evolve the language fairly rapidly without
                        impacting.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And it evolved… And it evolved… And finally we got to Perl 5. And… So…
                        Perhaps the Perl 6 slogan should be "All Your Paradigms Are Belong To Us".
                        We'll get to that.

                    <p>
                        So I'd like to start off with my own irrationalities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I don't think syntax should dangle in the wind. I'm with Aristotle. I think
                        things should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Which means I like K&amp;R
                        bracketing. I do not like the way that Python hangs stuff out there, with no
                        end.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I think that ordinary people dislike abstraction. That's because I dislike
                        abstraction and I think I'm ordinary. (laughter) I might be wrong about that,
                        but I don't know.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I simultaneously believe that languages are wonderful and awful. You have to
                        hold both of those. Ugly things can be beautiful. And beautiful can get ugly
                        very fast. You know, take Lisp. You know, it's the most beautiful language in
                        the world. At least up until Haskell came along. (laughter) But, you know,
                        every program in Lisp is just ugly. I don't figure how that works.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I think visual metaphors are very important. How it looks. Different things
                        should look different. Similar things should look similar. A language designer
                        simultaneously has to care what other people think, and has to not care what
                        other people think. Otherwise you go crazy. Well, crazier. (laughter)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And finally, I think God has free will. And therefore he created programmers
                        with free will and that they ought to be given choices.

                        Now, I'm not the only language designer with irrationalities. You can think of
                        some languages to go with some of these things.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>"We've got to start over from scratch" - Well, that's almost any academic
                            language you find.</li>
                        <li>"English phrases" - Well that's Cobol. You know, cargo cult English.  (laughter)</li>

                        <li>"I thought of a way to do it so it must be right" - That's obviously PHP.  (laughter and applause)</li>
                        <li>"You can build anything with NAND gates" - Any language designed by an electrical engineer. (laughter)</li>
                        <li>"This is a very high level language, who cares about bits?" - The entire scope of fourth generation languages fell into this… problem.</li>
                        <li>"Users care about elegance" - A lot of languages from Europe tend to fall into this. You know, Eiffel.</li>
                        <li>"The specification is good enough" - Ada.</li>

                        So my psychological conjecture is that normal people, if they perceive that a
                        computer language is forcing them to learn theory, they won't like it. In other
                        words, hide the fancy stuff. It can be there, just hide it.

                        Back to dimensionality. When you are saying something linguistically, it's like
                        taking a trip. You know, when you take a trip from California to Netanya, you
                        don't go straight south and then straight west and then straight north. It's
                        not orthogonal. There are little bits at the beginning. Then you take bigger
                        hops on the planes and then you take littler hops at the end. Language works
                        the same way, it's fractal. There is little orthogonality. At least apparently;
                        you can have orthogonal views of it, there are orthogonal subsets. But there
                        are multiple orthogonal subsets. At first glance it just looks like a network,
                        and you have to navigate the geography.

                    <p>Now in terms of the anthropology we try to welcome people into the tribe. We
                        allow people to have their own little fiefdoms, where they are the ruler and
                        can beat up on their followers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We try to let people share with each other. We try to capture knowledge. Both
                        of those things are why we have the CPAN, Comprehensive Perl Archive Network,
                        which is arguably one of the greatest repositories of reusable crappy software
                        in the world. (laughter).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And we have a culture of cooperating with other cultures too. We try to make
                        Parrot so that other languages can ran on top of that. We've always tried to
                        hook up Perl with everything. In kind of a humble sort of way. And finally it's
                        culture of fun. At least we try to make it that way. And that's why I give
                        weird talks.

                        So, everybody has a different idea. Everybody also has different hardware. The
                        desktop is also where all the hardware really exists. Servers have 1% of the
                        hardware that the desktop has in terms of different drivers and things like
                        that. You don’t find webcams on servers generally. You don’t find oddball IDE
                        drives on servers.

                        the first cave computer, it was a program to paint the string `Hello, world' in
                        Antelope pictures. Roman programming textbooks began with the `Salut, Mundi'
                        program. I don't know what happens to people who break with this tradition, but
                        I think it's safer not to find out. We'll start with a series of hello world
                        programs that demonstrate the different aspects of the basics of writing a
                        kernel module.

                    <p>
                        The difference between a program and a script isn't as subtle as most people
                        think. A script is interpreted, and a program is compiled.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Of course, there's no reason you can't write a compiler that immediately
                        executes the compiled form of a program without writing compilation artifacts
                        to disk, but that's an implementation detail, and precision in technical
                        matters is important.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Though Perl 5, for example, doesn't write out the artifacts of compilation to
                        disk and Java and .Net do, Perl 5 is clearly an interpreter even though it
                        evaluates the compiled form of code in the same way that the JVM and the CLR
                        do. Why? Because it's a scripting language.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Okay, that's a facetious explanation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The difference between a program and a script is if there's native compilation
                        available in at least one widely-used implementation. Thus Java before the
                        prevalence of even the HotSpot JVM and its JIT was a scripting language and now
                        it's a programming language, except that you can write a C interpreter that
                        doesn't have a JIT and C programs become scripts.

                    <p>Of course, if someone were to write an extra optimizer step for Perl 5 to
                        evaluate certain parts of the optree and generate native code in memory on
                        certain platforms without writing it out to disk (uh oh…) and then execute
                        that code under certain conditions, all Perl 5 scripts would automatically turn
                        into programs.  You know, like .pmc files, or Python's .pyc files. Uh.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As well, if more people use Punie (Perl 1 on Parrot) this year than native Perl
                        1 -- a possibility -- then Perl 1 scripts automatically become Perl 1 programs
                        because Punie can use Parrot's JIT. I don't know if this powerful upgrade from
                        script to program is retroactive, but I see no reason why not.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Perl 5 scripts were briefly programs while Ponie was viable, but the removal of
                        the code from the Parrot tree has now downgraded them back to scripts. We
                        apologize for the inconvenience.

                    <p>To summarize, if you have a separate compilation step visible to developers,
                        you have programs. If not, you have scripts. An exception is that if you have a
                        separate, partial compilation step at runtime and not visible to users, then
                        you may have programs. The presence of one implementation that performs
                        additional compilationy thingies at runtime instantly upgrades all scripts to
                        programs, while the presence of an interpreter for a language in which people
                        normally write programs, not scripts, does not downgrade programs to scripts.
                        Program-ness is sticky.</p>

                    <p>
                        I hope this is now clear.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ironically some JavaScript implementations have JITs, so the colloquial name of
                        the language should change from JavaScript to JavaProgram.

                        I have to say I cringed a little when I read it, because it helps
                        reinforce the idea that there's a sort of Perl Hierarchy, or that
                        there are Perl gods, or that "you must be this tall to ride".

                        Randal and I are just normal ol' Perl hackers.  We just spend a lot of
                        time on Perl, and writing about it, and talking about it.  The only
                        reason we are Perl luminaries is that we are Perl luminaries.  I'm not
                        necessarily a better programmer, or have better ideas, or I'm a better
                        debugger than anyone else.  I just do it and make noise about it.

                        Even though Joey's response was out of line, I admire his spirit of
                        "I'm just going to go do it."  TMTOWTDI is one of the cardinal rules
                        of Perl.  Similarly, over on the module-authors list, the perennial
                        argument of "Maybe CPAN should have minimum requirements for posting
                        modules" has raised its ugly head.  Instead, I said what I always say
                        during these arguments: "CPAN thrives BECAUSE of the unfettered
                        uploading of shit, not in spite of it."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So to it will be with Joey's website.  Maybe it will be a dismal
                        failure.  Maybe it will become the Next Great Perl resource.  However,
                        I know that there is zero chance of Next Great Perl resource if he
                        doesn't try.  The only way you get home runs is by stepping up to the
                        plate, and if you strike out, you're doing pretty good.  Batting 3/10
                        is a great batting average, but in real life we find those odds
                        terrifying.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Personally, as much as I like the community around Perlmonks, I think
                        it's a terrible site for new people, and is practically unsearchable.
                        I'd love to see something leapfrog Perlmonks and become the Next Great
                        Thing.  That's why I stopped writing to use.perl.org, because I think
                        it's a terrible news source.  Instead, I started perlbuzz.com, and
                        went with that.  Yes, it's different, but that's OK.

                        Suppose you went back to Ada Lovelace and asked her the
                        difference between a script and a program. She'd probably
                        look at you funny, then say something like: Well, a script is
                        what you give the actors, but a program is what you give the
                        audience. That Ada was one sharp lady…

                    <p> Now, however it was initially intended, I think BASIC turned
                        out to be one of the first major scripting languages,
                        especially the extended version that DEC put onto its
                        minicomputers called BASIC/PLUS, which happily included
                        recursive functions with arguments. I started out as a BASIC
                        programmer. Some people would say that I'm permanently
                        damaged. Some people are undoubtedly right.  </p>

                    <p> But I'm not going to apologize for that. All language
                        designers have their occasional idiosyncrasies. I'm just
                        better at it than most. :-) </p>

                    <p> Anyway, when I was a RSTS programmer on a PDP-11, I certainly
                        treated BASIC as a scripting language, at least in terms of
                        rapid prototyping and process control. I'm sure it warped my
                        brain forever. Perl's statement modifiers are straight out of
                        BASIC/PLUS. It even had some cute sigils on the ends of its
                        variables to distinguish string and integer from floating
                        point.  </p>

                    <p> But you could do extreme programming. In fact, I had a
                        college buddy I did pair programming with. We took a compiler
                        writing class together and studied all that fancy stuff from
                        the dragon book. Then of course the professor announced we
                        would be implementing our own language, called PL/0. After
                        thinking about it a while, we announced that we were going to
                        do our project in BASIC. The professor looked at us like were
                        insane. Nobody else in the class was using BASIC. And you
                        know what? Nobody else in the class finished their compiler
                        either. We not only finished but added I/O extensions, and
                        called it PL 0.5. That's rapid prototyping.  </p>

                    <p> My first scripting language was written in BASIC. For my job
                        in the computer center I wrote a language that I called JAM,
                        short for Jury-rigged All-purpose Meta-language. Story of my
                        life…  </p>

                    <p> JAM was an inside-out text-processing language much like PHP,
                        except that HTML hadn't been invented yet. We mostly used it
                        as a fancy macro processor for BASIC. Unlike PHP, it did not
                        have 3,000 functions in one namespace. We wouldn't have had
                        the memory, for one thing.  </p>

                    <p> For good or ill, when I went off to grad school, I studied
                        linguistics, so the only computer language I used there was
                        LISP. It was my own personal McCarthy era.  </p>

                    <p> Is LISP a candidate for a scripting language? While you can
                        certainly write things rapidly in it, I cannot in good
                        conscience call LISP a scripting language. By policy, LISP
                        has never really catered to mere mortals.  </p>

                    <p> And, of course, mere mortals have never really forgiven LISP
                        for not catering to them.  </p>

                        some common memes floating around:

                    <p>
                        That's not helpful.  When a project doesn't release a new version, some people
                        say "Oh, don't use it!  They don't release new versions!"  When a project
                        does release a new version, some people say "Oh, don't use it!  It's not
                        perfect yet!"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, the so-called reliable state of the art is a jumble of Perl which
                        writes cross platform shell scripts to install Perl code, and you customize
                        that by writing a superclass from which platform-specific modules inherit
                        pseudo-methods which use regular expressions to search and replace
                        cross-platform cross-shell code, with all of the cross-platform and
                        cross-shell quoting issues that entails.  I wish I were making any of this
                        up.  (I wrote tests for part of it.)
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        This is why we can't have nice things.

                    <p> I did all I could to stop it, but it just wasn't
                        possible.  pgTAP 0.20  has somehow made its way from my
                        Subversion server and infiltrated the  PostgreSQL
                        community. Can nothing be done to stop this menace? Its
                        use  leads to cleaner, more stable, and more-safely
                        refactored code. This insanity must be stopped! Please
                        review the following list of its  added vileness since
                        0.19 to determine how you can stop the terrible,
                        terrible influence on your PostgreSQL unit-testing
                        practices that is pgTAP: … </p>

                    <p> Don't make the same mistake I did, where I wrote a lot
                        of pgTAP tests  for a client, and now testing database
                        upgrades from 8.2 to 8.3 is  just too reliable! And by
                        all means, DO NOT read the documentation or  download
                        and install this monstrosity, since it could easily
                        lead to  cleaner, more stable code, and therefore
                        losing your job!  </p>

                    <p> I must dispute your view in the strongest terms
                        possible.  Internet Explorer is perfectly safe for
                        everyday use.  However, as there is no such thing as
                        perfect security, you must take additional precautions
                        to keep evil hackers away from your data. Apply these
                        rules according to the sensitivity of your data, from
                        least important to most: </p>

                    <ul>

                        <li> Disconnect your computer from your local network.
                            Download files on another computer, scan them for
                            viruses, print them out, scan them into your
                            Windows PC using OCR software, and then view the
                            pages in IE.  </li>

                        <li> Do the above, but have a priest onsite to bless
                            each page individually before scanning it. This is
                            an excellent deterrent against viruses with the
                            word "demon" in the name.  </li>

                        <li> Do the above, but encase your PC in acrylic and
                            immerse it in a 10,000 gallon tank of holy water.
                            Interact with it while wearing scuba gear.  </li>

                        <li> Do the above, but put a lid on the tank and
                            immerse it in the ocean. Interact with your PC via
                            a submersible robot in the tank from from outside
                            while wearing scuba gear.  </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If you fail to follow these simple security guidelines,
                        you can't blame Microsoft for the results.

                        <p> The move from a structuralist account in which
                            capital is understood to structure social relations
                            in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony
                            in which power relations are subject to repetition,
                            convergence, and rearticulation brought the
                            question of temporality into the thinking of
                            structure, and marked a shift from a form of
                            Althusserian theory that takes structural
                            totalities as theoretical objects to one in which
                            the insights into the contingent possibility of
                            structure inaugurate a renewed conception of
                            hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and

                    <p> By the eight brazen balls of Azuza the Bibulous

                    <p> Jonathan Schwartz&#8217;s resignation via Twitter
                        reminded me of a strange facet of Sun company culture:
                        I&#8217;ve never known so many married couples working
                        for the same company. Some of them even worked on the
                        same project together.  For the same boss.  From
                        home.</p>

                    <p>Now, the exact percentage of married couples in a
                        company can&#8217;t be used to compare companies
                        directly &#8211; after all, it depends heavily on
                        things like industry, age, and local marriage laws
                        &#8211; but it seems linked to another facet of Sun
                        company culture: Complete, almost embarrassing
                        disconnect from public opinion.</p> <p>The post-Google
                        standard company perks &#8211; free food, on-site
                        exercise classes, company shuttles &#8211; make it
                        trivial to speak only to fellow employees in daily
                        life.  If you spend all day with your co-workers,
                        socialize only with your co-workers, and then come home
                        and eat dinner with &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; your
                        co-worker, you might go several years without hearing
                        the words, &#8220;<strong>Run Solaris on my desktop?
                            Are you f&#8212;ing kidding me?</strong>&#8220;</p>

                    <p>Schwartz&#8217;s &#8220;the financial crisis did
                        it&#8221; explanation for Sun&#8217;s demise is a
                        symptom of an inbred company culture in which employees
                        at all levels voluntarily isolated themselves from the
                        larger Silicon Valley culture.  Tech journalists write
                        incessantly about the exchange of expertise and best
                        practice between companies as a major driver of the Bay
                        area&#8217;s success.  But you have to actually talk to
                        your competition to do that &#8211; over a beer, or
                        maybe a pillow.</p>

                    <p> Or think about shell programming, and reductionism. How
                        many times have we heard the mantra that a program
                        should do one thing and do it well?  </p>

                    <p> Well…Perl does one thing, and does it well. What it
                        does well is to integrate all its features into one
                        language. More importantly, it does this without making
                        them all look like each other. Ducts shouldn't look
                        like girders, and girders shouldn't look like ducts.
                        Neither of those should look like water pipes, and it's
                        really important that water pipes not look like sewer
                        pipes. Or smell like sewer pipes. Modernism says that
                        we should make all these things look the same (and
                        preferably invisible). Postmodernism says it's okay for
                        them to stick out, and to look different, because a
                        duct ought to look like a duct, and a sewer pipe ought
                        to look like a sewer pipe, and hammer ought to look
                        like a hammer, and a telephone ought to look like
                        either a telephone, or a Star Trek communicator. Things
                        that are different should look different.  </p>

                        of context. I was pointing out that Firefox's scheme is
                        only as secure as the master password you choose. The

                        trigger a brief moment of pleasant nostalgia,
                        forgetting that on /., every joke must be beaten to
                        death and explained, rehashed, insulted, re-explained
                        by someone who thinks the insult came due to
                        unfamiliarity, etc., until all traces of humor vanish.
                        Oh well… </p>

                    <p> Hmm… This is an old story, so this probably won't
                        receive any mods, but I have no idea what I'd mod it if
                        I were moderating.
                        Flamebait/Insightful/Funny/Interesting/Off-topic maybe?
                        Mods, if you can coordinate to apply each of those
                        once, it would be awesome (and I'd end up with overall

                <body>

                    <p> I keep hearing and reading this nice proverb <b>if it
                            ain't broke, don't fix it</b>. The latest appearance
                        was in response to <a
                            href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/37969.html">Shlomi
                            Fish</a> suggesting that some Ancient Perl code
                        should be replaced by Modern Perl code.  </p>

                    <p> I am not saying that every piece of code should be
                        rewritten every 6 months, but in my understanding that
                        sentence actually translates to <b>let's wait till it
                            breaks and then panic</b>.  </p>

                    <p> I think people who say that sentence are afraid that
                        the new version will break something. Sure, there is
                        always a chance that a change introduces an error, but,
                        if we are afraid to touch the code, what will happen
                        when later on we encounter a case where it does not
                        work? For example, if we need to use it in a new
                        environment. Will we have the courage to change the
                        code then? How much will it cost in money, time, and
                        lost sleep?  </p>

                    <p> I think we have been trying to teach ourselves that we
                        should have really good test coverage of our code and
                        then we can easily refactor it and get rid of technical
                        debt. So why do we keep hearing that sentence?  </p>

                    <p> Often, when I ask the people I train if they know Perl,
                        they tell me “I don't know Perl. I can only read it”.
                        I wonder whether it indicates that Perl is not a
                        write-only language as some people like to claim.  </p>

                    <p> Wait no, this wont work. You need to have a story to be
                        able to patent it. Soon all that will be on the air is
                        reality TV.  Noooo!  </p>

                        In this doggy-dog world, does grammer; spelling; “or
                        correct” quotation usage really matter anymore? I
                        beleive not. Case and point: mitsakes is literally a
                        diamond dozen, but they TOTALLY don’t make me want to
                        claw my eyes out with a dull spoon. Irregardless, it
                        begs the question: is it a mute point? For all
                        intensive purposes, if bad enlgish would of been the
                        downfall of society, then we’d of seen it bye now. some
                        say teh worst problem is loosing capitalization
                        punctuation is also an issue i think some thoughts need
                        to be seperated or maybe its the run on sentences? Does
                        it try your patients when I’LOL OMG Y U BFF said IDK
                        BRB?!! OIC, the BBQ is W/E GF IKR!!  1 How bad does it
                        get before i.e. its something up with which you will
                        not put?

                        packet’s wife.

                    <p> You might be on

                        stifle my creativity when it comes to comments. I'd
                        rather create Facebook pages for every package - that
                        way we could add karma by “liking” a package.  </p>

                    <p> We could even take it a step farther and use this for

                        next Wednesday and learn about the great new

                        “NetworkManager wants to be your friend”. Oh the
                        possibilities …</p>

                    <p> Then again, the thought of getting an email saying
                        “Anaconda is now following you on Twitter” also amuses
                        me.  </p>

                    <p> Popular pet names Rover, Cheryl and Kate could be a
                        thing of the past. Banks are now advising parents to
                        think carefully before naming their child’s first pet.
                        For security reasons, the chosen name should have at
                        least eight characters, a capital letter and a digit.
                        It should not be the same as the name of any previous
                        pet, and must never be written down, especially on a
                        collar as that is the first place anyone would look.
                        Ideally, children should consider changing the name of
                        their pet every 12 weeks.  </p>

                    <p>

                        Expectant mothers have also been advised to choose
                        carefully where they give birth. Anywhere that has a
                        place name is best avoided. These are listed on maps,
                        which are freely available on the Internet.  </p>

                    <p> It’s a good idea too, security experts have warned, for
                        children not to get friendly with certain teachers. For
                        instance, Miss Smith may be enriching your son’s
                        education but he should try and see if he can’t make a
                        favourite of Father O’Grinnighan-Scythe II, even though
                        it may mean a lot of staying late.  </p>

                    <p> We tried to call Barclays’ security expert R0b Ste!nway
                        for a comment, but he was not available for 24 hours,
                        having answered his phone incorrectly three times in
                        succession.  </p>

                <title>Why Debian May Have an Older Version of a Package</title>
            </meta>
            <quote>
                <body>
                    <p> There are a ton of reasons why Debian may have an
                        older version of an upstream release. For example, and
                        I hasten to point out that the following list is by no
                        means exhaustive, and not all of the possibilities are
                        common: </p>

                    <ul>

                        <li> The Debian package maintainer is dead, but nobody
                            noticed it yet, and nobody has wanted an update
                            badly enough to do an NMU or to adopt the package.
                        </li>

                        <li> The upstream release is actually a fake. It's a
                            trojan, which was put there by the NSA in order to
                            infiltrate the CIA mainframe. The Debian package
                            maintainer noticed this and uploaded that version
                            of the package to non-free instead of main, since
                            the trojan code does not come with proper source.
                        </li>

                        <li> Upstream has moved the RSS feed for new releases
                            without notifying the old feed of the move, so the
                            Debian package maintainer missed that, and doesn't
                            actually know about the new release. Due to a
                            complicated series of happenstance involving
                            rainbows, midget unicorns, and the ongoing rewrite
                            of the Netsurf web browser, the Debian package
                            maintainer is not able to find the new feed because
                            it would require doing a web search and their
                            browser doesn't have working form support now. No
                            other browser is available on the Amiga they're
                            using as their only computer, either.  </li>

                        <li> The new release is requested by insistent Hurd
                            porters, and the Debian package maintainer
                            absolutely loathes the Hurd, and will refuse to
                            upload any packages that work on the Hurd.  </li>

                        <li> The Debian package maintainer suffers from mental
                            problems cause by reading debian-devel too much,
                            and now has a nervous breakdown every time they
                            recognize a name as someone whom they've seen on
                            the list.  </li>

                        <li> The Debian development process is being sabotaged
                            by Microsoft sending people to the developers'
                            houses pretending to be TV license checkers or

                            worry that it breaks things in ways that makes the

                        Some European users bugged me into adding an option to
                        limit the number of messages retrieved per session (so
                        they can control costs from their expensive phone
                        networks). I resisted this for a long time, and I'm
                        still not entirely happy about it. But if you're
                        writing for the world, you have to listen to your
                        customers—this doesn't change just because they're not
                        paying you in money.

                        I have a book on my bookshelf that I’ve never read, but
                        that has a great title. It says, “All Truth is God’s
                        Truth.” And I believe that. The most viable belief
                        systems are those that can reach out and incorporate
                        new ideas, new memes, new metaphors, new interfaces,
                        new extensions, new ways of doing things. My goal this
                        year is to try to get Perl to reach out and cooperate
                        with Java. I know it may be difficult for some of you
                        to swallow, but Java is not the enemy. Nor is Lisp, or
                        Python, or Tcl. That is not to say that these languages
                        don't have good and bad points. I am not a cultural
                        relativist. Nor am I a linguistic relativist. In case
                        you hadn't noticed. :-)

                        A contest is being held to see which intelligence
                        agency can find a rabbit in a forest as quickly
                        as possible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        First, it's the CIA's turn. Using cutting edge
                        satellite technology, deep electronic scans, and other
                        high-tech equipment, it is able to locate the rabbit
                        in a week.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then, it's the KGB's turn. They install secret agents,
                        bribe or threaten a few animals, and find the rabbit
                        in two weeks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then it's the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Bet">Shin
                            Bet</a>’s turn (the Shin Bet being the Israeli
                        internal security agency). A week passes, and then
                        two, and then three.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After two months, the camera zooms into the
                        forest to see a bear tied to a tree with a
                        Shin Bet agent slapping him saying “Admit you’re a
                        rabbit! Admit you’re a rabbit! Admit it already,

                <body> <p> An engineer dies and reports to the pearly gates.
                        St. Peter checks his dossier and says, “Ah, you’re an
                        engineer. You are in the wrong place.” </p>

                    <p> So, the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is
                        let in. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied
                        with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing
                        and building improvements. After a while, they’ve got
                        air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and
                        the engineer is a pretty popular guy.  </p>

                    <p> One day, God calls Satan up on the telephone and says
                        with a sneer, “So, how’s it going down there in hell?”
                    </p>

                    <p> Satan replies, “Hey, things are going great. We’ve got
                        air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and
                        there’s no telling what this engineer is going to come
                        up with next.” </p>

                    <p> God replies, “What? You’ve got an engineer? That’s a
                        mistake. He should never have gotten down there; send
                        him up here.” </p>

                    <p> Satan says, “No way. I like having an engineer on the
                        staff, and I’m keeping him.” </p>

                    <p> God says, “Send him back up here or I’ll sue.” </p>

                    <p> Satan laughs uproariously and answers, “Yeah, right.
                        And just where are you going to get a lawyer?” </p>

                    <p>
                        There was a Rabbi living in Louisiana - he was
                        great in the Torah, very friendly, extremely helpful
                        and righteous - helps the poor, finds jobs for
                        people, resolves feuds - everybody liked him. And he
                        lived in a remote shack on the Louisiana coast, right
                        before Hurricane Katrina came.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So two people arrived there in a Jeep and told the
                        Rabbi: “Rabbi, there will be a flood, come with us so
                        you’ll be saved.” and the Rabbi said: “No, that’s OK -
                        God will save me.”.
                    </p>

                    <p> And indeed it started to rain, and there was a lot of
                        water, and so a boat arrived at the Rabbi’s house and
                        the people there told the Rabbi: “Rabbi, there’s a
                        flood, come with us and you’ll be saved.” and the Rabbi
                        told them: “No, that’s OK - God will save me.” and he
                        remained there.  </p>

                    <p> And it continued to rain, and the water level went up
                        and the Rabbi had to climb to the roof of his shack. A
                        helicopter arrived at his shack, and the people inside
                        told the Rabbi: “Rabbi, there’s a big flood. Come with
                        us to safety.”, and the Rabbi said: “No, that’s OK -
                        God will save me.”. And the Helicopter left.  </p>

                    <p> The water levels rose even more, and the Rabbi drowned,
                        and his soul went to heaven. There he confronted God
                        and asked him: “Dear God all mighty, I have been a
                        righteous and good man my whole life - why didn't you
                        save me?”, and God replied “Well, I tried. I sent you
                        a Jeep, a boat - even a helicopter - but you wouldn't
                        accept any of them. What more could I have done?” </p>

                    <p>
                        ————
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Moral of the story is: God helps them that help God
                        help them.

                        Two engineering students were walking across campus
                        when one said, “Where did you get such a great bike?”
                        The second engineer replied, “Well, I was walking along
                        yesterday minding my own business when a beautiful
                        woman rode up on this bike. She threw the bike to the
                        ground, took off all her clothes and said, "Take what
                        you want." The second engineer nodded approvingly,
                        and said: “Good choice; the clothes probably wouldn’t
                        have fit.”

                        Once I got into industry, I wrote a compiler in Pascal
                        for a discrete event simulator, and slavered over the
                        forthcoming Ada specs. As a linguist, I don't think of
                        Ada as a big language. Now, English and Japanese, those
                        are big languages. Ada is just a medium-sized language.

                        It was a <i>good</i> storm. There was quite effective
                        projection and passion there, and critics agreed that
                        if it would only learn to control its thunder it would
                        be, in years to come, a storm to watch.

                    <p> In Jerusalem, an American female journalist heard about
                        an old Rabbi who visited the Kotel, the Western Wall to
                        pray twice a day every day for over five decades.  </p>

                    <p>In an effort to check out the story, she goes to the
                        holy site and there he is. She watches the old man at
                        prayer and after about 45 minutes, when he turns to
                        leave, she approaches him for an interview. “I’m
                        Rebecca Smith from CNN, sir, how long have you been
                        coming to the Wailing Wall and praying?”</p>

                    <p> “For about 50 years,” he informs her. “That’s amazing!
                        What do you pray for?” “I pray for peace between the
                        Jews and Arabs. I pray for all the hatred to stop and I
                        pray for all of our children to grow up in safety and
                        friendship.”</p> <p> “And how do you feel, sir, after
                        doing this for 50 years?” </p>

                    <p> “Like I’m talking to a brick wall!” </p>

                <body>

                    <p> I find it insanely difficult to read these comments [to
                        my blog posts]. Not because they’re bad or mistaken,
                        but mainly because I have very thin skin. There’s a
                        direct correlation between what I read and pain in my
                        gut. Even unfair and mistaken criticism cuts me in ways
                        that are just silly. If I read a bad comment before
                        bed, I don’t sleep. If I trip upon one when I’m trying
                        to write, I can be distracted for hours. I fantasize
                        about creating an alter ego who responds on my behalf.
                        But I don’t have the courage for even that deception.
                        So instead, my weakness manifests itself through the
                        practice (extraordinarily unfair to the comment writer)
                        of sometimes not reading what others have said.  </p>

                    <p> So then why do I blog all? Well, much of the time, I
                        have no idea why I do it. But when I do, it has
                        something to do with an ethic I believe that we all
                        should live by. I first learned it from a judge I
                        clerked for, Judge Richard Posner. Posner is without a
                        doubt the most significant legal academic and federal
                        judge of our time, and perhaps of the last hundred
                        years. He was also the perfect judge to clerk for.
                        Unlike the vast majority of appeals court judges,
                        Posner writes his own opinions. The job of the clerk
                        was simply to argue. He would give us a draft opinion,
                        and we’d write a long memo in critique. He’d use that
                        to redraft the opinion.  </p>

                    <p> I gave Posner comments on much more than his opinions.
                        In particular, soon after I began teaching he sent me a
                        draft of a book, which would eventually become Sex and
                        Reason. Much of the book was brilliant. But there was
                        one part I thought ridiculous. And in a series of faxes
                        (I was teaching in Budapest, and this was long before
                        e-mail was generally available), I sent him
                        increasingly outrageous comments, arguing about this
                        section of the book.  </p>

                    <p> The morning after I sent one such missive, I reread it,
                        and was shocked by its abusive tone. I wrote a sheepish
                        follow-up, apologizing, and saying that of course, I
                        had endless respect for Posner, blah, blah, and blah.
                        All that was true. So too was it true that I thought my
                        comments were unfair. But Posner responded not by
                        accepting my apology, but by scolding me. And not by
                        scolding me for my abusive fax, but for my apology.
                        “I’m surrounded by sycophants,” he wrote. “The last
                        thing in the world I need is you to filter your
                        comments by reference to my feelings.” </p>

                    <p>I was astonished by the rebuke. But from that moment on,
                        I divided the world into those who would follow (or
                        even recommend) Posner’s practice, and those who
                        wouldn’t. And however attractive the anti-Posner pose
                        was, I wanted to believe I could follow his ethic:
                        Never allow, or encourage, the sycophants. Reward the
                        critics. Not because I’d ever become a judge, or a
                        public figure as important as Posner. But because in
                        following his example, I would avoid the worst effects
                        of the protected life (as a tenured professor) that I
                        would lead.</p>

<p>
I was lucky as Ricardo SIGNES was also awake who explained that actually he has
stopped using Module::Starter as he is writing
<a href="http://metacpan.org/release/Dist-Zilla">Dist::Zilla</a>
that provides much better project management capabilities. I pointed him at
my blog entry and after reading it he asked me if I know the expression
<b>yak shaving</b> [= performing a task which is required by a different
task which is required by… to achieve what one wants in the first place].
I've heard it, actually I even read about it in
in <a href="http://productiveprogrammer.com/">The Productive Programmer</a>
I mentioned earlier in
<a href="http://szabgab.com/the-quest-for-the-perfect-editor.html">The
Quest for the Perfect Editor</a> but I did not really understand it.
</p>

<p>
Actually, I think I understood it back when I read the book but promptly
forgotten it as I did not have any way to connect the expression to the
actions or lack of actions.
</p>

<p>
I was so lucky to find Ricardo there, as he explained:
</p>

<ul>
<li> I need to fix this bug, but first I better eat something so I don’t get tired. </li>
<li> So I'm going to have some cereal, but I'm out of milk.</li>
<li> So I'll go get some milk.  But I heard that yak milk is the best, so I'll
go out to Nepal to find a yak.</li>
<li>But they're all so hairy, I can't get to their udders.</li>
<li> So, first I'll just shave the yak.</li>

</ul>

<p>

This is just the way you have to teach. Now I can remember it much more easily.

                    <p> Tim Berners-Lee's abandonment of the <a
                            href="http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~mm/pdf/dexter.pdf">Dexter
                            Model for hypertext</a>  a hypertext model where
                        all links must be resolvable at all times  was (IMHO)
                        the single biggest factor in creating a successful
                        World Wide Web.  </p>

                    <p> Before the Web, hypertext systems were assumed to have
                        all links resolvable at all times. This was not a
                        robust design. Now, you would think this would be more
                        robust than the Web  but it fails even for single-file
                        hypertext systems. Early in my career, I realized that
                        computer systems were not 100% reliable, so if wanted
                        to create software that failed safe (or at least failed
                        soft), you had to account for errors at every step of
                        the way. A single-file hypertext system can still fail
                        if access to the single file is disturbed. Across the
                        Internet, where all computers on the Internet have not
                        been all up at the same time since the late 1970's (and
                        possibly not even then), you cannot build a Dexter
                        Model hypertext system because not all of your links
                        can be resolved all of the time.  </p>

                    <p>Microsoft's Help system has become much more usable
                        since they went to a Web (i.e. HTML) based-system.  At
                        the risk of being redundant, even if you have a lint
                        program to verify all hypertext links and destinations,
                        file access errors will derail your hypertext system
                        when you use a all-resolvable-all-the-time design (and
                        I don't know if Microsoft had such a lint tool).</p>

                    <p>It boils down to handling failures with at least a small
                        amount of grace. Unix/Linux systems handle errors much
                        better than Microsoft Windows 1.0-3.x systems because
                        processes can handle out-of-bounds memory errors better
                        (Windows NT and its descendants fall in-between
                        Unix/Linux and 16-bit Windows). I once wrote a Perl
                        4-based server that would run for months at a time
                        because it could either recover gracefully from an
                        error or stop gracefully upon an error. The Web runs as
                        well as it does because the software systems handle
                        link errors with a small amount of grace, rather than
                        just throwing up their hands or dying horribly. Thank
                        Tim Berners-Lee and his fellow designers for the
                        reliability of the Web we have today.</p>

                        Beliefs are what divide people. Doubt unites them.

                    <p>
                        Feeling my way through the darkness<br />
                        Guided by a beating heart<br />
                        I can't tell where the journey will end<br />
                        But I know where to start<br />
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        They tell me I'm too young to understand<br />
                        They say I'm caught up in a dream<br />
                        Life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes<br />
                        Well that's fine by me<br />
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So wake me up when it's all over<br />
                        When I'm wiser and I'm older<br />
                        All this time I was finding myself<br />
                        And I didn't know I was lost<br />
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I tried carrying the weight of the world<br />
                        But I only have two hands<br />
                        I hope I get the chance to travel the world<br />
                        But I don't have any plans<br />
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Wish that I could stay forever this young<br />
                        Not afraid to close my eyes<br />
                        Life's a game made for everyone<br />
                        And love is the prize<br />
                    </p>

                        As it turns out, compiling a C program [= Vim] from
                        more than 20 years ago is actually a lot easier than
                        getting a Rails app from last year to work.

                    <p> A banker, who always advised his son to think big,
                        came home one day to find the boy in the yard with the
                        family dog and a sign, “Dog for Sale, $38,000.” The
                        father smiled and went into the house.  </p>

                    <p> The next day, the sign–and the dog–had vanished. The
                        banker asked his son, “You didn’t get $38,000 for the
                        dog, did you?” </p>

                    <p> “No,” the boy replied, “but I

                <body>

                    <p> When I was 18, I had been drumming for about 10 years.
                        (They say that if you want to be a good drummer, you
                        better have started by your teenage years, or you'll
                        never make it.) </p>

                    <p> I got a call from my neighbor. He was about 65 years
                        old.  </p>

                    <p> "Jason," he said, "I made a promise to myself when I
                        turned 60 that I was going to do 3 things. Lose 60
                        pounds. Stop smoking. And learn to play a musical
                        instrument. So far, I've done 2 of those things." </p>

                    <p> "Which two?" I asked.  </p>

                    <p> "I hear you're a pretty good drummer. Would you like to
                        teach me how to drum?" </p>

                    <p> (I didn't know what to say. You can't learn drums when
                        you're SIXTY-FIVE! What do I tell him? Well, maybe it'd
                        be best to let him try it, then he can move on to
                        guitar or piano or something if he doesn't like it.)
                    </p>

                    <p> I've never seen anyone that age take a hobby as
                        seriously as this guy took drumming. A year later, he
                        was pretty proficient, and I cried a little when, after
                        I left for college, I saw a video of him playing live
                        on stage at a concert back home.  </p>

                    <p> I learned way more from him than he did from me. I
                        figure now that I should have been the one paying him
                        for the lesson.  </p>

                    <p> You ain't dead until you decide you're dead.  </p>

                        Trust me: every problem in computer science may be
                        solved by an indirection, but those indirections are
                        <b>expensive</b>. Pointer chasing is just about the
                        most expensive thing you can do on modern CPUs.

                    <p> “Let’s free ourselves from the shackles and do
                        something bold!” </p>

                    <p> I always cringe when I hear this battle cry. Isn’t that
                        sentiment exactly what set the trajectory for the Perl
                        6 effort? Maybe it’s just been so long that people have
                        forgotten.  </p>

                    <p> But that is precisely how Perl 6 became such an
                        amazingly long trek: once you remove the constraint of
                        staying compatible, everything is suddenly,
                        potentially, up for reconsideration. Then when you
                        start changing things, you discover that changes in one
                        part of the language also affect several other, remote
                        parts of the language. So it starts with the simple
                        desire to fix a handful of obvious problems in obvious
                        ways… and spirals out as you make changes, and further
                        still as you make changes in response to your changes,
                        ever further and further.  </p>

                    <p> At that point, it is exceedingly likely that the
                        project will fizzle out before it ever comes to any
                        fruition. But even if you have the perseverance, you
                        face an uphill battle: unless your project has the
                        community’s implicit blessing as the successor (as Perl
                        6 does, due to Larry’s presence), it is likely to
                        simply slip into oblivion… the way Kurila did.  </p>

                    <p> So yes: backcompat is holding us back… the same way
                        that gravity is. It keeps us from floating away
                        untethered.  </p>

                    <p> Note that I’m not saying it doesn’t really hold us
                        back. I’d love to travel to space easily, too! I still
                        await Perl 6, as well.  </p>

                    <p> But what I think, every time someone proposes to throw
                        off the shackles of backcompat and go for it, is that
                        we already have one Perl 6 – we don’t need another.

                    <p> Reportedly, SANE (= “Scanner Access Now Easy”) was
                        called that way in part so one can say “TWAIN is not

                        that I’m an adult, I pretend that those rules and

                        brand new program for overweight pop-stars to go
                        from bass to treble in just 90 seconds. It’s called
                        Treble 90X.

                <title>PSD is not my favourite file format.</title>
            </meta>
            <quote>
                <body>

                    <p> At this point, I'd like to take a moment to speak to
                        you about the Adobe PSD format.  PSD is not a good
                        format. PSD is not even a bad format. Calling it such
                        would be an insult to other bad formats, such as PCX
                        or JPEG. No, PSD is an abysmal format. Having worked
                        on this code for several weeks now, my hate for PSD
                        has grown to a raging fire that burns with the fierce
                        passion of a million suns.  </p>

                    <p> If there are two different ways of doing something,
                        PSD will do both, in different places. It will then
                        make up three more ways no sane human would think of,
                        and do those too. PSD makes inconsistency an art form.
                        Why, for instance, did it suddenly decide that *these*
                        particular chunks should be aligned to four bytes, and
                        that this alignment should *not* be included in the
                        size? Other chunks in other places are either
                        unaligned, or aligned with the alignment included in
                        the size. Here, though, it is not included.  Either
                        one of these three behaviours would be fine. A sane
                        format would pick one. PSD, of course, uses all three,
                        and more.  </p>

                    <p> Trying to get data out of a PSD file is like trying to
                        find something in the attic of your eccentric old
                        uncle who died in a freak freshwater shark attack on
                        his 58th birthday. That last detail may not be
                        important for the purposes of the simile, but at this
                        point I am spending a lot of time imagining amusing
                        fates for the people responsible for this Rube
                        Goldberg of a file format.  </p>

                    <p> Earlier, I tried to get a hold of the latest specs for
                        the PSD file format. To do this, I had to apply to
                        them for permission to apply to them to have them
                        consider sending me this sacred tome. This would have
                        involved faxing them a copy of some document or other,
                        probably signed in blood. I can only imagine that they
                        make this process so difficult because they are
                        intensely ashamed of having created this abomination.
                        I was naturally not gullible enough to go through with
                        this procedure, but if I had done so, I would have
                        printed out every single page of the spec, and set
                        them all on fire.  Were it within my power, I would
                        gather every single copy of those specs, and launch
                        them on a spaceship directly into the sun.  </p>

                    <p> PSD is not my favourite file format.  </p>

                        There was a country which bordered two enemy countries
                        - one to the north and one to the south. So they set up
                        a computer to report if one of the enemy countries was
                        attacking it and placed an army officer in charge of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One day the computer raises the alarm and says “Attack!
                        Attack! We are attacked!”. So the officer asks it:
                        “From the north or from the south?” and the computer
                        replies: “Yes.”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The officer asks it again ”Are we getting attacked from
                        the north or from the south?”. And the computer replies
                        : “Yes.”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The officer gets angry and asks: “‘Yes’, what?”. The
                        computer thinks for a moment and replies: “Yes, SIR!!”.

                            was for creating testcases that could be understood
                            by non-technical clients, so you can concretely
                            discuss features. If you're writing a compiler then
                            all your clients will be programmers, so there's no
                            need for such a thing.

            <p>

            Maybe Just Nothing
            </p>

            <p>

            The issue is that you can't special case get_current_coords to be
            truish, as far as Devel::Cover is concerned - it might not be.
            </p>

            <p>

            Any fix that could be thought up is inherently problematic.
            </p>

            <p>
            Coverage reporting is not done for the pretty colors - a human reads
            it, and says "OK, this is logical, get_current_coords always returns
            a true value". It's not a race for greens and percentages.
            </p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>

            While I agree coverage is not a race, I disagree that a human should have
            to disambiguate between real missing coverage and a false negative.  At
            least not more than once.
            </p>

            <p>

            I'll make the same argument "no broken windows" argument here that I do
            about warnings and tests: eliminate all warnings, even if they are dubious.
            Ensure all tests pass eliminating all false negatives.  Do not leave any
            "expected warnings" or "expected failures" because this erodes the
            confidence in the test suite.  Warnings and test failures fail to ring alarm
            bells.  One "expected" warning leads to two.  Then four.  Then finally too
            many to remember which are expected and which are not and you ignore them
            all together.
            </p>

            <p>

            The Pragmatic Programmer does a good job with this argument.
            http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/extracts/no_broken_windows.html
            </p>
            <p>

            So goes the same with coverage.  Red should be a BAD color, something you
            do not want to see.  You want to eliminate the red.  But sometimes its a
            false negative.  In that case there should be some way to tell the tool
            that it is, in fact, a false negative.  Just like skipping tests, you
            store the fact that there is a false negative to make the red go away.  Red
            remains a bad color and seeing it means something is wrong.  The team doesn't
            have to remember which bits are expected to be uncovered and which are not.
            </p>

            <p>

            What's missing is a way to let Devel::Cover know that a bit of coverage is
            not necessary.  The first way to do this which pops into my mind is a comment.
            </p>

            <p>

            my $foo = $bar || default();  # DC ignore X|0
            </p>

            <p>
            "Hey, Devel::Cover!  Ignore the case where the right side of this logic is
            false."
            </p>

            <p>

            Ignored conditions would be green, but perhaps a slightly different shade of
            green so they can be spotted if you're looking for them.

                <p> So, did I immediately launch into a furious whirl of coding
                up a brand-new POP3 client to compete with the existing ones?
                Not on your life! I looked carefully at the POP utilities I had
                in hand, asking myself ``Which one is closest to what I want?''
                Because: </p>

                <p>

                2. Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite
                (and reuse).  </p>

                <p>

                While I don't claim to be a great programmer, I try to imitate one. An
                important trait of the great ones is constructive laziness. They know that you
                get an A not for effort but for results, and that it's almost always easier to
                start from a good partial solution than from nothing at all.  </p>

                <p>
                Linus Torvalds, for example, didn't actually try to write Linux from scratch.
                Instead, he started by reusing code and ideas from Minix, a tiny Unix-like
                operating system for PC clones. Eventually all the Minix code went away or was
                completely rewritten—but while it was there, it provided scaffolding for the
                infant that would eventually become Linux.  </p>

                I recall a conversation where I told that in the comics HelpDex, the protagonist
                has wondered whether God was a programmer and in what programming language he wrote
                the universe. Then she had a dream where she heard God saying "I will tell you in which
                language I wrote the universe: Object-Oriented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>!"
                at which point the protagonist wakes up scared.

                Then, a different participant who had immigrated from the former Soviet Union said
                that he was reminded of a story he read in a Soviet science magazine, where God and
                his angels were technicians who kept changing the universe based on how humans perceived
                it. Then during the 20th century, they had to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle">subatomic
                particles</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">black holes</a>
                and more, and fondly recalled how they once took a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_turtle">giant world turtle</a>,
                put four elephants on top, and called it a day

            <p> I thought using loops was cheating so I programmed my own
            samples. Then I thought using samples was cheating so I recorded
            real drums.  </p>

            <p> I then thought that programming it was cheating so I learnt to
            play drums for real. I then thought using bought drums was cheating
            so I learnt to make my own.  </p>

            <p> I then thought that using pre-made skins was cheating so I
            killed a goat and skinned it. I then thought that that was cheating
            too, so I grew my own goat from a baby goat. I also think that is
            cheating but I'm not sure where to go from here. I haven't made any
            music lately, what with the goat farming and all.  </p>

There's the story of Mullah Nasruddin, who was asked why he never married and answered, "I was looking for the perfect wife. I went to Damascus and met a wonderful woman but she had no spiritual side. Then I went to Cairo and met a woman who was deeply spiritual, but we didn't communicate well. I went from place to place looking for the perfect woman, then finally I found her and she was beautiful and spiritual and we communicated well. She was perfect."
</p>

<p>
Then his friend asked why he didn’t marry her, and Mullah Nasruddin replied, "Unfortunately, she was looking for the perfect man!".

Of her charitable pursuits, she (= Sarah Michelle Gellar) says:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I started because my mother taught me a long time ago that even when you have
nothing, there's ways to give back. And what you get in return for that is
tenfold. But it was always hard because I couldn't do a lot. I couldn't do much
more than just donate money when I was on [Buffy] because there wasn't time.
And now that I have the time, it's amazing.

Seems like these four rabbis had a series of theological arguments, and three
were always in accord against the fourth.  One day, the odd rabbi out, with
the usual "3 to 1, majority rules" statement that signified that he had lost
again, decided to appeal to a higher authority.  "Oh, God!" he cried.  "I
know in my heart that I am right and they are wrong!  Please show me a sign,
so they too will know that I understand Your laws."
</p>

<p>
	It was a beautiful, sunny day.  As soon as the rabbi finished his
plaint, a storm cloud moved across the sky above the four.  It rumbled once
and dissolved.  "A sign from God!  See, I'm right, I knew it!"  But the other
three disagreed, pointing out that stormclouds form on hot days.
</p>

<p>
So he asked again: "Oh, God, I need a bigger sign to show that I am
right and they are wrong.  So please, God, a bigger sign."
</p>

<p>
This time four stormclouds appeared, rushed toward each other to form
one big cloud, and a bolt of lightning knocked down a tree ten feet away from
the rabbis.  The cloud dispersed at once.  "I told you I was right!" insisted
the loner, but the others insisted that nothing had happened that could not
be explained by natural causes.
</p>

<p>
The insisting rabbi is all ready to ask for a *very big* sign when
just as he says "Oh God..." the sky turns pitch black, the earth shakes, and
a deep, booming voice intones, "HEEEEEEEE'S RIIIIIIIGHT!"
</p>

<p>
The sky returns to normal.  The one rabbi puts his hands on his hips
and snarls, "Well?"  "Okay, okayyyy," replied another, "so now it's 3 to 2!"
</p>

As the French writer André Gide put it, “Everything that needs to be said
has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be
said again.” If we’re free from the burden of trying to be completely
original, we can stop trying to make something out of nothing, and we can
embrace influence instead of running away from it.

 There is a Chinese story of a farmer who used an old horse to till his fields. One day, the horse escaped into the hills and when the farmer's neighbors sympathized with the old man over his bad luck, the farmer replied, "Bad luck? Good luck? Who knows?" A week later, the horse returned with a herd of horses from the hills and this time the neighbors congratulated the farmer on his good luck. His reply was, "Good luck? Bad luck? Who knows?"
</p>

<p>
Then, when the farmer's son was attempting to tame one of the wild horses, he fell off its back and broke his leg. Everyone thought this very bad luck. Not the farmer, whose only reaction was, "Bad luck? Good luck? Who knows?"
</p>

<p>
Some weeks later, the army marched into the village and conscripted every able-bodied youth they found there. When they saw the farmer's son with his broken leg, they let him off. Now was that good luck or bad luck?
</p>

<p>
Who knows?
</p>

<p>
Everything that seems on the surface to be an evil may be a good in disguise. And everything that seems good on the surface may really be an evil. So we are wise when we leave it to God to decide what is good fortune and what misfortune, and thank him that all things turn out for good with those who love him.
