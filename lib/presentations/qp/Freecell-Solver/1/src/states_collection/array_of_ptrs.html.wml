<li>
Version 0.2 of Freecell Solver stored the states in a flat array of structs.
</li>

<li>
I converted it into an array of pointers to dynamically allocated structs,
due to the fact that I ran out of stack on Windows NT when passing
the arrays to functions as parameters.
</li>

<li>
This had the happy effect of making the program much faster.
</li>

<li>
Reason: Sorting an array of pointers is much faster than sorting an array
of structs, because a pointer is considerably smaller.
