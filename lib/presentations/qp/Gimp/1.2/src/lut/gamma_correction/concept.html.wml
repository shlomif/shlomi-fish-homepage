If we assume that the maximal colour value is 1 and the minimal is 0,
then by applying a function of x ** (1/gamma) to every pixel we will
modify the histogram while not overflowing from the image boundaries
(which cannot be said on brightness and contrast manipulations).

The more positive the Gamma is the brighter the resultant image will be.
