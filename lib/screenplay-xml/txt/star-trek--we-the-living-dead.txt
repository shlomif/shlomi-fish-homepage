<s id="watching_space" title="Watching Space">

[Bashir, Dax and Jake are standing watching the space.]

Bashir: ah, space.

Dax: yep, space. Nothing but nothing all around.

Jake: hey look at that. (A ship gets out of warp at the distance).

Bashir: oh no.

Jake: what's wrong?

Bashir: I can recognise this ship anywhere. It's OTF-1 - Othello
Task Force.

Jake: Othello Task Force? What's that.

Bashir: they're merceneries. Only they're really good merceneries. Really
really good merceneries. Too good. Too good until the whole of Star Fleet
hates their guts.

Jake: why's that?

Dax: Jake, not only do we wish all merceneries were like them, their captain
wants us to be certain of this fact, so he keeps scheduling routine checks.
And the last thing we need is to check them. Times and again, without ever
finding anything interesting there.

+++: However, Jake, you may be interested to know that many of the fighters
there are really hot girls, who are about your age.

Jake: heh, do they get shore leave?

Dax: oh, yes, and some of them are wild.

Jake: OK, yeah.

[Beep sounds. Dax answers]

Dax: yes, Captain?

Capt. Sisko's Voice: Commander: can you and Dr. Bashir come to Quark's
conference room? Find Jake and bring him with you.

Jake: I'm here, dad.

Sisko: OK. Please come.

Bashir: Quark's conference room? I wonder what's there.

[ They walk and eventually arrive.]

<s id="essence_of_the_Q_continuum" title="The Essence of the Q Continuum">

[Quark's conference room. Q is there, as is a stranger middle-aged-looking
woman. All the cast is there including Quark and his brother. Jake, Dax and
Bashir enter.]

Dax: Q!

Q: greetings, commander - have a seat, make yourself at home, and meet Q2
("Queue-Two").

Q2: my pleasure. I am indeed Q2.

Jake: is there also Q3 and Q4?

Q: certainly.

Sisko: in any case - why do you want to see us?

Q: I have a question for you: as you know, I am omnipotent. Now: can I
write a computer program that determines if any other computer program
terminates or not?

Dax: the Turing theorem...

Sisko: yes, Commander, I know. This has logically proven to be impossible,
and the proof is very simple. So you cannot do it unless you can somehow
change logic.

Q: and can I, being a Q and all?

[ Silence for a moment. ]

Sisko: I don't think you can. I think it is inconcevieable to think you can
change logic. In fact, I don't think you are omnipotent. I just think you
appear omnipotent to us, because you are such an advanced lifeform or even just
have a sufficiently advanced technology.

++++: In fact, for all I know you may be a humanoid.

[Q claps his hand]

Q: Captain Sisko - I'm always amazed at how stupid your race is, and how much
wrong you can be.

Jake: you mean - you can change logic?

Q: oh no. This time you were right. Yes, I am not omnipotent. I am only very
technologically advanced. And and yes, I am a humanoid.

[Cut]

Sisko: I suppose you belong to the human master-race that created all other
races.

Q: That's right.

Sisko: so how old are you?

Q: I'll be about 6.5 milliard terran years next September.

Sisko: so I gather your race has conquered death.

Q: death and most other things.

Bashir: if I may interrupt, it has always been my observation that death
is completely unnecessary, and that our society could have eliminated
it a long time ago.

Q: but you haven't.

Bashir: yes.

Sisko: may I inquire who Q2 is?

Q: certainly. Q2?

Q2: I am in fact the oldest organism that never died. I am about 40 milliard
years old.

Dax: that's a long time before the big bang.

Q2: oh the "Big Bang". We don't call it that. The big bang was in fact an
explosion of a massive black hole. But it's not the first time it happened and
not the last. We have some great videos of it.

[Dax and Jake are smiling and giggling]

Q2: in any case, I have eventually converted to a human form when I joined the
Q Continuum.

Sisko: very interesting - most interesting. In any case, I've just been
messaged by Captain Krand of the Othello Task Force that he wishes us to
inspect his ship, before he lets his crew have shore leave. And while this
fascinates me, I need to juggle some priorities as well.

Q: actually, I suggest we meet in an hour at the holo-deck, I have some
things to show you there [shows a module].

Quark: ahmm... Mister Q, the holo-decks require some payment to use.

Q: no problem, here are two bars of Gold-pressed Latinum. [gives to him]

Quark: that will do.

[ Cut to Sisko, Dax, Bashir and Jake]

Sisko: Dax, Bashir, will you go and check on OTF?

Dax: yes, Captain.

Jake: ah, Dad, can I join them?

Sisko: I don't see why not, sure, go along.

Jake: thanks!

[They go]

<s id="in_the_Othello_Task_Force" title="In the Othello Task Force">

[The Othello Task Force's ship - a great hall full of busy people. They are
dressed more informally than the Star Fleet ones, with more variation. Not
all of them were tight clothes.]

<!--
TODO: FILL IN.
-->

<s id="meet_Katie" title="Meet Katie">

[Close up to the system administrators' room. To the right there is a row with
three screens and three QWERTY keyboards. To the left there is a library with
a large selection of books. There are several dolls of furry animals scattered
around the room, and the room is quite disorganised. Katie is sitting on the
close QWERTY keyboard and is typing some things.]

[Katie is a blonde girl in her early-to-mid twenties. Her face is cute. I
originally pictured Melissa Joan Hart as playing her.]

[Jake and Bashir enter.]

Jake: holy shit, this place is...

Katie: a system administrators' room!

Bashir: yeah, we know. We're the Star Fleet guys. We're going to pretend
that we inspect this place.

[Jake goes over to the shelves to look at the books.]

Katie: be my guest. Oh! Katie Jacobson [does a salute] at your service. I'm
originally from Berkeley, California.

Jake: Berkeley? Cool, I remember San-Fransisco. So what are you doing here
now?

Katie: oh well... I've been to a place that taught me a little about software,
a little about computers, and a little about how to fake that I actually
know either or both.

Bashir: let me guess - Star Fleet Academy.

Katie: nope - the Technion.

Jake: the... Technion...

Bashir: in Haifa?

Katie: yep.

Jake: but couldn't you have gone to U. Cal Berkeley, instead?

Katie: I could walk there from my house, yes. But I figured out I needed
a challenge. And I wanted to learn Hebrew - ya know, the language the Old
Testament was written in, and the langauge which the Terran Alphabet was
invented for, etc.

Jake: I bet you just wanted to get away from your parents.

Katie: that too. Heh.

Jake: did you graduate?

Katie: yeah, I did. B.Sc. in Computer Engineering. I even got a cum laude, if
it's worth anything to you.

Bashir: so what are you doing here?

Katie: good question. See: I got a job doing programming for a
company. It was very good, working on open-source software and all, but I just
remained in Earth all the time. So then it occured to me: is that all there's
to life in the 25th century?

+++: So I decided that instead I'm going to join some people who travel a lot,
and utilise some of my skills for that. And one thing I can say about
this task force is that there's almost always something interesting going
on.

Bashir: oh sorry, we haven't introduced ourselves. Dr. Julian Bashir.

[Katie shakes his hand]

Jake: Jake Sisko.

[Katie looks startled.]

Katie: Jake Sisko? Oh my god, oh my god - look how this place looks.
[she starts organising the place] Just my luck! Just when a writer is coming
to visit...

Jake: hey, that's OK. That's OK. I actually like this place. It's very...

Katie: very something yes. [she stops]

Jake: so? You're a fan of my works?

Katie: are you kidding? They rock! I read almost every single one. I wish
I could write like that, but all I can write is really bad poetry and even
worse short snippets of prose that don't go anywhere. You have a gift.

Jake: [flattered] thanks.

[ They stare at each other, and then look the other way.]

Bashir: so, Ms. Jacboson...

Katie: Katie, please.

Bashir: "Katie"... I suppose you know your way around technology...

Katie: well, I couldn't fix a computer even if my life dependended on it.
They never even showed us how to change a lightbulb in the Technion. Good
thing, some of the other people here are good at it and are saints.

++++: However, I do know how to use all sorts of computers. Can you take out
your tricorder for a seq?

Bashir: sure.

[Katie takes out her tricorder, and puts it besides Bashir's Tricorder. They
practically look the same]

Katie: It's same tricorder as the Star Fleet one, except for branding.
Now let me show you something - let's try to put it in Unix-mode and use it.

[She takes out the Palm-like pen, and starts writing a few commands. The
screen shows an IceWM screen with a few windows. Katie invokes a terminal,
and types the command:

{{{{{{{
$ tricorder-disp --what="env temp"
}}}}}}}

A two-dimensinoal window springs up and displays the temperature of the
window in real time]

Jake: holy cow!

Katie: yes, still good old UNIX. Which we still studied in school. But
I breezed through it, because I already knew it when I came there.

Bashir: ahmmm... Katie... would you like to accompany us on a presentation
by "Q" of the "Q Continuum"?

Katie: you mean the supposedly omni-potent alien? I suppose. Never met him.

Bashir: actually, according to what he told us, he's not really omnipotent,
and he's actually a humanoid.

Katie: I knew it. Jake, that sounds like it's going to be the best first date
I've ever had.

Jake: "first date"?

<s id="bitten_by_a_snake" title="Bitten by a Snake">

[Bashir and Jake approach Dax. Jake looks perplexed.]

Dax: Jake, are you OK? You look like you were bitten by a snake.

Jake: Jadzia, I just got hit by a girl... who's way out of my league!

Dax: I know the feeling.

Bashir: and the funny thing is that she seems to feel the same way about
Jake.

Dax: sounds like a match made in heaven. OK, I think we can give the OTFers
shore leave now.

Jake: Katie included.... mmmmm....

<s id="history_of_the_Q_continuum" title="History of the Q Continuum">

[Cut to Quark's Holodeck - everyone is there.]

Q: Greetings people. I have given Quark a holodeck module - nothing special
about it for a demonstration. What you're about to see happened in my
race's home planet over 6 milliard years ago. We just broke up from the reign
of an empire called the "Ivrim". They were not too good and not too bad.
As such we adopted their language, only with many errors.

Katie: modern Hebrew?

Q: precisely.

+++: Anyway, we also had another language, universal among our continent which
we called Énglish. It was just like modern English only pronounced
phonetically. Rather hideous. This language was considered holy - everyone
knew it, but people were afraid to talk in it. It was reserved for the
"perophets", who were people who talked with the "Bey-de-jor-eans", who
were our gods.

Kira: hmmmpppfff...

Sisko: hmmpppf indeed. How come all these co-incidences?

Q: the Universe is co-incidential, Captain, for some reasons which even we
don't fully understand yet. And for the record, even we were preceded by
different human races, etc.

Sisko: I see. Go on.

Q: in any case, there was this relatively mature man in our time called
Noahh who had three sons.

Katie: Shem, Hham and Yepheth? [in Modern Hebrew pronouncation]

Q: you guessed it. He was a quirky, paranoid fellow. At one point he sensed
a storm coming, and believed that the world was coming to an end. So he, his
wife, his sons, and all of his livestock travelled up a nearby mountain, and
waited for the storm to end. [Pictures are shown]

+++: When the storm ended, he went down to the nearby village, and saw that
while there was a lot of damage, it was perfectly fine. However,
he claimed that it was high time to put an end to such problems, to end
having to depend on natural whims, that our society will flourish.

+++: I was there: my name was indeed "Que" and I was considered a strange
nomad, who just happened to be there. I decided to take upon myself
the establishment of the [in Énglish] "civilisation" instead of the
many different [in Énglish] "cultures".

+++: Now there were many kids in the village who seemed to be amused by that.
One thing was that they often had trouble pronouncing "Shem"'s name with
a "Sh" sound and instead used "S" - Sem. People found it annoying,
but the children couldn't care less.

+++: Back then, writing systems were still hideously complex, and no one used
them. So I told the kids to come up with a good writing system. They
decided to collect 26 symbols of the signature signs of some people
in the village, and figure out a way to write using it.

+++: Eventually they invited us all to a presentation.

[The holo-deck shows a long shot of an Énglishtant field. One kid is
showing up the Latin alphabet]

Énglish Boy: Aa, Ba, Tsa, Da, É, Fa, Ga, Ha, I [= Ee], Ja [as in French],
Ka, La, Ma, Na, O, Pa, Qua, Ra, Sa, Ta, U, Va, Wa, Xa [= Kha], Ya, Za

[ Then he points to a sign saying
"THÉ NÉO TÉCH CONSPIRACY FOR ÉSTABLISHING THÉ SÉMITIC CULTURÉ"
]

Énglish Boy: tehe ne-o-te-tse-heh konspeerasi for establishing te-he
semeeteec cooltooré!

Q: [interrupting. ] The people were mad, he mispronounced Shem's name. He
formed a conspiracy, and he wanted to establish yet another culture.

[Back to the people]

Kids: Haqol Qara! Haqol Qara

Q in the holodeck: The voice has called. The voice has called.

Q in the Énglishtant scene: Haku rega! Ooooof!

[Eventually he steps on a mound saying:]

Q in the Énglishtant scene: Qara Ma Sheqara, yiqreh ma sheyiqreh, haqol qoré
liph'amim!

Q in the holodeck: what I said was ambigious in Hebrew. Let's say it means
"He called what he called. Whatever will happen - will happen. The voice
calls sometimes."

[In the Énglishtant scene, everybody have fallen silent. Then a small boy starts
calling]

Small boy: Q Gadol! Q Gadol! Q Gadol!

[Everyone joins him, they carry Q on their hands until an even larger hill
and puts him there.]

Q: [in Énglish] Vampires of the world - unite! These kids have invented the
Aa-Ba-Tsa, which will make writing easy. I want an Aa-Ba-Tsa for Hebrew, too.
I want something to facilitate calculations. And let's tell the world about
it. I want it all, and I want it now!

[The crowd cheers]

Q: [in the holodeck] three days after this, some people invented the decimal
system. We sent delegates to other villages and countries bringing the news of
the Alphabet and all our other discoveries and decisions. Eventually, I found
the Énglish pronouncation too tedious, so I asked people to make a better one.
And someone came up with modern English.

Katie: heh.

Q: we advanced quickly. A year later we already had steam. We discovered our
planet was round, and circled the globe within 10 years. We defined a
constitution, and founded mass-production and the free market. I kept asking
for  more  and more challenges to accomplish. Here is what happened after 40
years:

[The holodeck shows Q standing on the hill where he had given the speech
holding a flag. There's a large crowd and many cameras are visible. He then
moves to the right and sticks the flag somewhere else.]

Vision Q: [in modern English] Vampires of the world - we are united! 40 years
ago I stood there [points to the top of the hill] and decided to form an
encompassing civilisation for our entire planet. Today, I can say we have been
succesful.

+++: We've already been extending our lives incrementally by large
differeneces. But it will be nice to find a way to remain young
forever. So this is the next Q task. And another one is to conquer the
stars. So go to work! [The crowd cheers]

Holodeck Q: we conquered the stars and spread across the galaxy. Within 400
years, we encircled the galaxy in one go using this ship [Shown a very old
and antiquated ship].

Q2: isn't she a beauty?

Q: At that point we were approached by the Alpha Continuum. They sent Q2 here
[Q2 blushes] to greet us.

Q2: I'll take it from here. It took the Énglishtants 400 years from the
invention of the Alphabet till the circling of the Galaxy. 400 years for
a Carbon-based lifeform was a record that was not broken ever or since. I
informed Q that the Alpha Continuum provided the Énglishtants with protection
against pre-mature deaths, and gave other services that Continuums give.

+++: Q informed me that since his race had been so succesful, he has decided
to form their own Continuum - the Q Continuum. After some thinking, I told
him that I would join the Q Continuum, as an act of appreciation for them
being so competent and determined.

Sisko: so I understand that the Q Continuum is not the first Continuum to
have been span-off the Alpha Continuum.

Q: not at all.

Sisko: I see.

+++: Q: so you've misled us to believe you were the most uncooperative
being in existence, while in fact projecting the greatest cooperative
project in the history of the universe?

Q: well, for some values of "greatest". See: I used to be a simple common
organism. But six and a half milliard years later and a lot of technological
advancement have made me much less dependent on other people's whims.

+++: I appear rather blazé and always have been to some extent. But I still
don't wish to die now or never. Technology can give you many things,
but we high-order Q's still find a lot of joy in a walk in the woods,
or in tasty food, or in the little joys of life. We're still human,
after all.

Dax: wow!

Q: in any case, fast forward to the present - this happened about 20 days ago.

[The holodeck shows a very large hall crowded with millions of different
humanoids. Three gigantic strips of light on the ceiling are lighted one after
the other, from the closest to the farthest. Then the whole hall is lit.
There are Nazi flags on the wall, and a gigantic Swastika above the stage. Q
is standing there.]

[Focus on Q]

Q: [shouting] My name is Q!! I saved you all!! You've had the misfortune or
folly to die, but don't worry - you're still alive. You will be relocated to a
different planet and a different galaxy. And you can thank me for it!

+++: Meanwhile, here's some background music:

[Starting playing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4c1KNjTixo">the
Kobra Mix of the Black Eyed Peas' "Hey Mama!" song</a>]

Fergey's Voice: Rip it, mama!

[Music starts playing.]

[Cut to the people at the holo-deck - they are amused and seem like they
find it hard to believe.]

Q: anyway, we would like to invite those of you who would like it,
to come with us to the headquarters of the Q Continuum.

Dax: I would be delighted.

Katie: me too! me too!

+++: I mean: so do I! so do I!

Bashir: I'd like to come to.

Kira: hold your horses, people! We do not know what possible dangers
lurk in the Q Continuum. If you are indeed going to go then I and other
security officers must escort you.

Katie: Major, I think you overestimate the danger. This is Q after all. If
he wanted, we would all be dead now.

++++: He could hurl this entire space station directly into the Bajorean sun.

Q: I could do that.

Katie: he could spread our atoms evenly in the entire galaxy.

Q: I could do that too.

Katie: he could...

Sisko: that's enough, Miss Jacobson! OK, Major, you can escort these people.
Q: would it be OK if my crew took their phasers with them?

Q: their phasers? Of course. They can also bring some photon torpedoes if they
wish. None of them will work, but I don't mind them taking them.

Quark: speaking of technology, I'd like to tag along and film the entire trip.
I sense a huge business potential to this, and would be willing to give the
rest of you 10% of the profits.

Kira: hmmpfff.

Quark: 15%?

Katie: Captain Sisko, are you coming?

Sisko: I'm afraid I'm not. I'll stay here and keep an eye on the space station.
You kids go along.

Jake: I'd like to go too.

Sisko: have fun, son.

Jake: thanks. Katie, why don't you have a phaser?

Katie: a phaser? Oh... I'm all for the right to bear arms and all, but I hate
these things. My job does not require me to carry one anyway.

Jake: OK.

Q: anyone else would like to come with us?

Odo: I guess I'll also join you.

Q2: OK, cool. We'll let you kids do last minute arrangement and we'll meet
here in 45 minutes. Meanwhile I'll have a drink.

[ They spread. ]
Q: I could use one too. Quark, how much would that be?

Quark: two drinks would be two strips of gold-pressed Latinum.

++++: However, Mr. Q., I recall you saying you could provide me with 1 million
pieces of gold-pressed Latinum.

Q: that's nothing, Mr. Quark. I can conjour a ball made out of gold-pressed
Latinum the size of a red giant. Of course, it will quickly implode into
a nasty blackhole. Nothing we can't handle of course, but still.

[Cut to Quark - he is speechless and looks astonished.]

Q: But two strips should be enough - there you go.

[Title: The Q Continuum Headquarters]

Q: are everyone ready?

Dax: I think so. Yes, everyone's here.

Q2: OK - please don't be alarmed as the surroundings changes incrementally.
It's a trick we do to make the teleportation change easier.

Dax: Roger.

[The sorroundings change and eventually change to a well-lit large room.
There's a large window to the left.]

Dax: so I presume that's part of the Q Continuum headquarters? According to
this tricorder we seem to be on a completely different galaxy. A different
galaxy cluster even.

[Katie, Jake and other people approach the window]

Katie: wow! It's beautiful.

[View of the Q Continuum planet - there are several tall white buildings
none of which obscure the views. They are shaped like a trumpet, and there
are robots going up and down their tall parts.

There is a lot of trees and forests intermingled. There are large roads made
of very clean stone, with some alien life forms, most resembling mammals
walking in between them.]

Kira: [unethusiastically] impressive, I say.

Worf: quite lovely.

Dax: well back to our business. Is there anything we're looking here?

Q: Sure. Amanda, please come here.

[Amanda from <a href="http://sttng.epguides.info/?ID=306">The True Q
Episode</a> enters through a door.]

Amanda: greetings people.

Katie: wait a second - she looks like...

Dax: yes, you're the honour student that was identified as a Q on a USS
Enterprise mission.

Amanda: that is indeed the case. As you see my parents - both human - had to
return to the Q Continuum and decided to leave me on Earth (as a normal human
baby) because some of them Terran friends became attached to me.

Dax: and I suppose your parents missed you?

[
1st level Q: A conscious organism.<br />
2nd level Q: A vampire - capable of living forever.<br />
3rd level Q: An immortal - cannot be killed.<br />
4th level Q: capable of teleporting within the same planet.<br />
5th level Q: capable of any teleportation.<br />
6th level Q: capable of teleporting himself and others.<br />
]

Amanda: that too, and they decided to meet me. So I was temporarily EnQed to
a very high Q level, and then decided to come here. I met my parents and
decided to start my road as a "Q" here. Right now, I'm a sixth level Q, and
trying to slowly become more confident in not abusing my powers. Great power
requires great responsibility.

Katie: Sixth level Q?

Amanda: yep. A Q that is capable of teleporting himself and others.

Katie: I see. What's a first-level Q?

Q2: a first level Q is any conscious organism. A second level Q is a
"vampire" - an organism that doesn't die. A third level Q is an "immortal"
- an organism that cannot be killed.

Katie: ah hah.

Dax: and what about that woman of the humanoid master-race (the
Énglishtants, I presume) told us about the master race dying and
all?

Q: oh that. That was The Symbol [pronounced "Té Symbol"]...

Katie: The Symbol, wait a second! [checks her laptop]. Hmmm... a very powerful
sourceress in the Forgotten Realms world; an omni-potent goddess in the Plarian
mythology; and the list goes on.

Dax: so she is one of your most powerful Q's?

Q: The Symbol? Hardly! She is in fact an old technophobe that after all the
milliards year is still only a 3rd level Q, and relies on us for transportation.
She's a bit distressed from always being considered a practically omni-potent
being.

++++: In any case, she is considered the oldest Énglishtant (not
quite accurate, but still), and has been the "T" in our alphabet.
Displaying that message around the galaxy was her idea. But it was a
simplification.

Bashir: ah hah. By the way, Q2, I would be interested to know what was your
original form like?

Q2: you can certainly know. Look here [points to a screen].

[The screen shows a large number of Opposum-like creatures on a Jungle-like
sorrounding, eventually going to a city.]

Bashir: an opposum?

Q2: indeed. I still miss it in a way. Giving birth as "an opposum" is very
painless. In my human forms, after the third time I gave birth, I couldn't
take it anymore and instead used artificial pregnancies.

Bashir: wow! I think I know what to do to implement exactly that...

Worf: that's enough, Doctor.

Dax: Don't be too uptight, Commander.

Bashir: that's OK.

Q2: in any case, I'll leave you kids for now.

Dax: are you too busy?

Q2: no. Busy people are unproductive. We are very productive and so we're
never busy. But I need some rest, and think I'm no longer needed here. Q
can always find me.

Dax: sure.

Q2: meanwhile, you'll probably want to meet the living dead.
[she leaves through the door].

Katie: the what?

Q: the living dead. People whom you believed to be dead, while in fact being
relocated to a different galaxy, fully living there. Is there anyone specific
you'd like to meet?

Katie: can I go first? [enthusiastically]

Worf: Miss Jacobson, ...

Dax: sure you can, Katie!

[Worf seems unamused.]

Katie: I'd like to meet the big 20th-21st century UNIX hackers. You know,
Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Linus [= Lee-nos] Torvalds, Richard Stallman,
Larry Wall - the works.

Q: that is doable. Is it OK with you people?

Dax: I suppose.

Quark: and I smell a huge business potential for a movie with them featured
in.

Amanda: done then, let's go.

[The scenery gradually changes until they appear in a campus of a university
with modern buildings styled like a Mexican village.]

Katie: Stanford??

Jake: yeah, looks that way!

Dax: as a matter of fact no - we're still in the same (and different) galaxy
cluster, but on a different galaxy. This isn't Earth.

Q: Welcome to the Planet of the Hebrews.

Jake: planet of the Jews?

Q: I said "Hebrews" not "Jews". These include many ancient Hebrew-speaking
people: Kna'ani, Phoenician, Edomi, Amoni, Midyani, etc. And yes - Israelites
and Jews.

[They enter individually into a large well-lit room. Several well-known
present-day UNIX programmers are sitting there to the front and the left
of the camera next to QWERTY keyboards and computer screens.]

Amanda: hi all. Remember how I told you about the mission from your original
Galaxy? Then here they are.

Ken Thompson: hi all! Welcome, we're always happy to have some visitors.
Working on the computer all day long, or chatting about the same things with
ourselves for over 400 years gets a bit repetitive really quickly.

[Some of the missionaries laugh]

Linus Torvalds: Ken, do you always have to tell this joke?

Ken Thompson: at least it's new material for everybody who hears it the first
time. Seriously now: we didn't get bored here, but a nice change of scenery
is always good. We, the living dead, thrive on fresh meat.

Linus: And freshmeat-dot-net.

Katie: heh. Man, this is so exciting. Just out of curiosity - what are you
doing here? Hacking on the code of the universe?

Larry Wall: well, we're still negotiating with God about that, but he's a
tough negotiator and won't let's us near the damn thing. Security by obscurity
considerations or something like that.

+++: However, we're working on the next best thing - the source of the
Q Continuum.

Linus: here - check it out:

[The camera zooms to show an electrical circuit-like diagram which looks
very messy.]

Katie: what the hell is this?

Linus: 1,367 bits processors with a large number of 245 bits processor
slaves...

Katie: but that's not even a power of 2!

Linus: it's not. Everything is written in Assembly. Very interesting
Assembly. Instructions range in size from 1 bit (the No-op) to several
thousands of bits.

Katie: oh my God.

Ken: you should be thankful they are still using bits and not some other
base system. Or that they had Assembly.

Linus: yes, it is pretty hideous. Now we're re-implementing it using more
modern, and more sane, technologies.

Katie: sounds like fun.

+++: so, come on, tell me about everything: about Unix, about Linux, about 
the GNU project, about everything.

<s id="king-david" title="King David">

Quark: while I find this geek nostalgia amusing, I think we miss the point
of us being in the planet of the Hebrews. We could meet with famous Hebrews
of the past.

Katie: right, like King David. Oh, can we please meet him?

Ken Thompson: [clicks a few keys. ] Dave, can you come here for a sec?

[The door opens and a moderately short man, looks in his thirties appear. He
has dark red hair, and a small beard.]

David: David Ben-Yishay. At your service.

Katie: seriously?

Jake: this is gonna make a wonderful story.

[ Cut. ]

David: yes, I was King David.

Katie: did you really kill Goliath?

David: yes, I did. It was nothing really. We Semite shepherds were masters with
the sling. I once hit a Lion at three times the distance, and frankly it
was much more agile than the fully armoured Goliath and his pathetic 
shield-bearer.

Jake: heh, nice. Are you still King here?

David: that's a long story. See, when the first conscious Hebrew speakers
came here, we were told that this was the underworld. We thought, "Wow! Nice
underworld!". So we just ate, drank, played games, made love, played
music and stuff. But we got tired of that.

Jake: so what did you do?

David: we got into philosophy and science. We actually started a short time
before the Greek philosophy took off, but naturally, it then gave us a real 
boost. So we established universities and started studying and inventing
stuff.

David: since we were living dead, we were not influenced by the rise of
Christianity and the middle ages, and just went on. As a result, we're now
even more advanced than Earth is, as ironic as it is. I became a scholar too.

Jake: what did you specialise in?

David: see, we don't have that here. Each Scholar (which is our modern term
for "philosopher") studies various units of knowledge, and passes tests, and
gets credit. But you can study anything you want in any field. The more units
you have the more prestigious you are. I've contributed to my own share of
inventions: the camera, the hyper-drive, a few programming languages, other
stuff and a lot of humane things.

Jake: wow, cool.

David: anyway, to me being king. Back when the Hebrew peoples came here, we
didn't see a point in appointing administration. It was just "live and let 
live" (well, we could no longer be killed) and "do and let do". But as more
and more dead Jews (and some dead Christians and Muslims) arrived here,
they sort of wanted me to be king.

Katie: so you became king?

David: well, not at first. I objected to it. I had much better things to 
do than be king again. And naturally, the Edomis, the Phoenicians,
the Moabites, and the others didn't really want me as king either. But 
eventually, I was voted king and reluctantly became one. So now I'm a king.
And a scholar.  

Quark: [with the camera] wonderful, wonderful, I'm sure all those Terrans
will pay mad-coin to see this. Keep going.

Bashir: speaking of Terrans, I don't suppose Jesus is here.

David: as a matter of fact he is. Let me summon him.

<s id="jesus" title="Jesus">

[Shortly afterwards the door opens and a tall man with black hair enters.]

Jesus: Yeho'shu'a' Nazrathi. At your service.

Katie: so you're real.

Jesus: heh, most of what they tell about me in the New Testament was anything
but real. My followers and I were mostly possessed or Schizophreniacs.
Arguably, the same thing could be said on the earlier Jewish prophets, but
we uttered mostly complete non-sense.

Katie: ah.

Jesus: in any case, regarding my death. I actually survived the cross, and
was taken care of by a kind Jew. He nursed me and restored me to sanity.
I decided to travel to Babylon where there was a prosperous Jewish community
and where they were in much better shape than Judea at the time. So I did.

+++: There I learned to read and write, studied the Torah, and became a 
merchant. I died a grandfather and came here.

Jadzia: wow!

Jesus: the whole old gang met here, and completely laughed at some of the
non-senses we said. As it turned out Christianity actually started as a cult
of Pagan Roman Priests, who only later adopted pseudo-Jewish beliefs as a way
to battle the Jews, who met them with a lot of resistance. 

+++: after Christianity took over, people here told me "Hey Josh, this is
all your fault. So they forced me into becoming their No. 1 expert of Christia
nity.

+++: Early Christianity was horrible. They considered pleasure the primary 
evil, and greatly oppressed women. Humans were considered to be very bad, and
very evil. It took the world a lot of time to recover from it.

+++: several Christian girls were intelligent and smart enough to see through
the many logical fallacies of Christianity and to demonstrate how irrational
and stupid it was. Even the Bishops and Archibishops were no match for them.
So the Church retorted to burning them as witches. A lot of them arrived 
here as heroines.

Katie: heh.

Quark: wow, excellent stuff. I'm going to make a fortune out of this movie.

Jake: damn right you will. Speaking of Jesus and David, how about other famous
Jews of the past? Moses? King Solomon?

David: ahmm... they're not here.

Jake: you mean - they were resurrected in a different planet?

David: no, they didn't die in the first place. They are vampires.

Jake: wow! A vampire is...

David: someone who doesn't die.

Jake: so they're still on Earth.

Q: yes, they are. Do you want to go there now?

[They all say "yes".]

Q: ok, let's go.

[The scene gradually changes to a terran valley.]

Katie: and we're on Earth. Israel. The Yizra'el Valley, next to a Moshav.

Worf: Earth? Isn't it a breach of security?

Q: Commander, the Q Continuum has no problem bypassing your primitive 
security measures.

Worf: I see.

a wide swing nearby.]

Q: we should go over there.

<s id="terran-vampires--meet" title="Meet the Terran Vampires">

Shlomo [munching]: Dvorah, it tastes differently this time.

Dvorah: yes, I've been playing with the ingredients this time.

Mosheh: yes, it does tastes differently.

[The gang approaches.]

Katie: Professor Shlomo Abramovich? You're King Solomo... Errr...
I'm not talking with you again. [Goes to sit on the Swing, frustrated.]

Shlomo: Mosheh, remember I told you about Katie?

Mosheh: oh yeah! She looks cute when she's angry.

Katie: Moses, right?

Mosheh: that's right.

Katie: well, in case you have any interest in me, I should note that I
have a policy against getting involved with people who are 4 times my senior
or more.

Mosheh: relax! I married girls who were 15 times my junior or more
and my own descendants, and retrospectively I can tell that many of them
were more mature and rational than I was in most respects.

Katie: I'm not surprised.

[Mosheh, Shlomo and Dvorah chuckle, the rest of the crew smile. Jake
sits next to Katie on the swing seat.]

Worf: so Mr. Abramovich... I mean, Prof. Abramovich... I mean - Your
Majesty!

Shlomo: Mister, Doctor, Professor, General, Admiral, Duke, Baron, Count,
Earl...

Mosheh: Fellow of the Royal Society!

Shlomo: indeed. Nasi, Rabbi, Rav, Emir... you name it - I had it. Just call
me Shlomo.

Worf: I see. Mr. Shlomo.

Dvorah: men, I tell you - overachievers, and always need to travel. I stayed 
most of the time here.

Gadzia: and you are.

Dvorah: I'm Dvorah.

Bashir: Dvorah the Prophet?

Dvorah: in a sense. See, I've been conscious since I was a little girl,
and never hallucinated voices like the Nevi'im did. I was just recognised
as a prophet because I was deemed so wise. I was good at settling
disputes and so decided to eventually settle here in the Yizra'el Valley
under a Date Tree.

+++: I expected to die soon, but for some reason, I didn't.

Jake: so the story in the Bible is true?

Dvorah: oh, that. See, the Israelites here were indeed under threat. So I 
decided to assign the task of fighting the Kna'anis to Baraq, a young brat who 
was conscious and rebellious and gave me nothing but trouble, but that I knew 
was very smart and clever. He did pretty well on the task. Then we partied.

+++: Baraq is now doing Archaelogical work for the Q continuum in the Peach
Seed Galaxy. Indiana Jones style. This kid could never remain quiet for long.

Bashir: and was the song yours?

Dvorah: song, song. Ah yes. Yes, but it was a later addition. See a few
centuries later, some kids approached me asking for information about the
battle so they could do a play about it. I told them all about it and then
they said "That's it?". 

+++: So we spent a day composing a song, and rehearsed it, and eventually
it was recorded in the Bible after God knows how many transformations and
rewrites. But otherwise I just stayed here.

+++: well, I fled to Judea after the Assyrian conquest, and left with the
Judeans to Babylon. Then I returned here, and saw that my Date tree was
cut down. I eventually said "whatever" and settled near here ever since.

Gadzia: wow!

Q: Dvorah, BTW, is considered the Terran elder, and thus is the ambassador
of Earth in the Q continuum.

Dvorah: yeah well, I was appointed as such because I was older than Mosheh
here, but I wasn't really the oldest living human. In fact, there are four
women and two men who are older than me and still alive.

Katie: I don't get it!

Mosheh: don't get what?

Katie: you guys, are like - vampires - you can do anything, and yet we had
so much suffering since then here on Earth. Why didn't you stop World War II?

Katie: Jake, what are you doing?

Jake: working on a story. Oh drat! I made a mistake. Let me correct it. I
recall the time that Nog fixed some of my errors, and I found that
distressing.

Katie: so why hadn't you restored a previous version of the document?

Jake: a previous version? What do you mean?

Katie: let me show you.

[She takes the notebook.]

Katie: these things had version control built-in for centuries. [A listing of
the edits is displayed on screen.] See: you can revert to a previous change,
see the difference between two revisions, and see where everything changed at
any given time. [various on-screen simulations]. Didn't you know that?

Q: it will be a communication channel between your quadrant and the Q

"Cool Java Hackeh Et Hamumheh"]

Q: anything beyond "Cool Java Hack" is not recommended for pregnant women.

Katie: ooh! Can I try?

Sisko: not now. Are you also recruiting other Q's?

Q: sure. We can always use more people. We could use all the help we can get.

Amanda: indeed, you can get yourself enQ-ed here.
