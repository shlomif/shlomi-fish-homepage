<p>
<b>1 April, 2015, Tel Aviv, Israel:</b> Today, the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) announced the immediate availability of the new version of the web —
<b>HTML 6</b> — pronounced “HTML Sicks [sic]” with the motto “HTML 6 is sick!”.
“We concluded that the previous version of the World Wide Web’s standards
suite, HTML5, has exceeded its flexibility and usability, and we need to
start over”, said Tim Berners-Lee, the director of the W3C.
</p>

<p>
HTML Sicks will offer many exciting new features and innovations over
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a> that will make the
lives of web developers easier than ever before. Among these new features
are:

<ol>

<li>
<p>
The markup will be converted from being SGML/XML-like to being
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON"><b>JSON</b>-like</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
CSS (= Cascading Style Sheets) will be replaced with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting"><b>XSS</b></a>
(Cross-site-scripting).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The mandated version of the underlying <b>HTTP protocol</b>
(= “Hyped Text Transfer Protocol”) will be HTTP/6.0, also known as
“Transmission Control Protocol” or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">“TCP”</a>
for short.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
HTML 6 will offer PHP as a built-in <b>client-side</b> scripting language in
addition to JavaScript, for an exciting full-stack development environment
in PHP.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
For making migrations from legacy apps easier, HTML 6 will support Graphical
User Interface (GUI) development using the
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html"><b>Windows API</b></a>
, in C, using the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
The W3C and the “HTML 6” development team recommend that everyone convert
their web sites to the new version as soon as possible.
