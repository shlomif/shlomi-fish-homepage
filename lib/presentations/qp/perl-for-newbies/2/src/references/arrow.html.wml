<p>
An arrow (<tt>-&gt;</tt>) followed by a square or curly brackets can be used
to directly access the elements of an array or a hash referenced by a certain
hash. For instance: <tt>$array_ref-&gt;[5]</tt> will retrieve the 5th element 
of the array pointed to by <tt>$array_ref</tt>.

As an example let's print a tree of the contents of the part of the lecture
that was presented in the previous slide:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/references/print_contents.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
Note that the arrows following the first arrow are optional as perl sees 
that the programmer wishes to access the subseqeunt sub-items. However, the
first one is mandatory because the expression <tt>$array_ref{'elem'}</tt> looks
for the hash <tt>%array_ref</tt>.
