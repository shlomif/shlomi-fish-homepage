[

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Holm">Holly Holm</a>, the martial
artist who would defeat Ronda Rousey, is standing in a mall. Ronda approaches her.

]

Ronda: Holly, right?

Holly: That is right. Nice to meet you, Ronda.

Ronda: My pleasure [they shake hands.]

+++: Let's get straight to business: I presume you know I know why you invited me
for a day of "fun, socialising, and <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/hacking_and_amateur__vs__conformism_and_professional.xhtml">geeking out</a>".

Holly: To break your streak? If so, then yes!

Ronda: Well, it worked. You've won the psychological war. It's a shame really…
it would have been fun to keep it. You know how I am
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/learning_more_from_inet_forums.xhtml">an entertainer first</a>
and a martial arts' fighter later.

Holly: Heh… aren't we all?

Ronda: Yeah! [She thinks for a moment.]

+++: Hold it! But what if we fake a streak? It’s been a while since there was
one in pro-MMA and it’ll be a good publicity stunt for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship">UFC</a>.

Holly: Heh… I like your way of thinking, Ronda! Conspiracies are a time-honoured
tradition.

Ronda: Great! Wanna roll dice on who will be the streak-owner?

Holly: Nah… it was your idea, so it’s going to be you.

Ronda: really? Thanks! [She hugs Holly.]

Holly: heh, heh. Now that it is settled, let's have fun and geek out - as promised.

+++: You know, I was chatting on IRC the other day, when someone noted that he
read about a man who started with a paperclip and after some stages of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter">barter</a> ended up owning
a mansion.

Ronda: heh, hacks! I presume you won't agree to buying me a mansion, today?

Holly: Naturally not… but I can buy you a paperclip. A pack of 50 paperclips
is also within my budget.
