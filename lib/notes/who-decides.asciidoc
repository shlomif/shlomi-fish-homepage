The story
---------

During one taxicab ride I took (I think it was from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv[Tel Aviv]
to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa[Haifa]) we picked up a couple where the man was
a Hebrew-speaking Israeli and his fiancée, who had an East Asian complexion and was an immigrant,
didn't speak Hebrew well and we spoke to her in English.

We got to talk about relationships, and the driver decided to ask people we saw beside the road
"who gets to decide, before and after marriage?".

One young woman we asked that said: "[before?] the man" and "[after?] the woman". A different
one told us "The woman gets to decide, both before and after the marriage."

We translated what they told us to English for the fiancée, and her Hebrew-speaking fiancé
told us they had mutual agreement as a couple.

True story.
