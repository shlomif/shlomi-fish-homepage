<p>
In a here document, one specifies an ending string to end the string
on a separate line, and between it, one can place any string he wishes.
This is useful if your string contains a lot of irregular characters.
</p>

<p>
The syntax for a here document is a <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> followed by
the string ending sequence, followed by the end of the statement. In
the lines afterwards, one places the string itself followed by its
ending sequence.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example:
</p>


<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/string-forms/here-doc.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
Its output is:
</p>


<quadpres_code_block>
The value of $a is: "Hello"
The value of $str is: "There you go."
The value of true is: "False"

Hoola


</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
Note that if the delimeters on the terminator after the <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>
are double-quotes (<tt>"..."</tt>), then the here-document will interpolate,
and if they are single-quotes (<tt>'...'</tt>), it will not.
