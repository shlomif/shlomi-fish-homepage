<s id="about-objective" title="Objective">

[

«

As an example, we can imagine a young girl to write a funny screenplay
using GitHub or Google Docs which pits
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Emma-Watson/">Emma Watson</a> vs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a>
on who gets to ride <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Princess_Celestia">Princess Celestia</a> next,
with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader">Darth Vader</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haman">Haman</a>
as two "evil", but mutually hating one another, arbiters. Might seem ridiculus,
but if I didn't want entertainment in my life, then I'd go watch grass grow.
It will be a legal and "ethical" minefield, but I'd bet it'd be easier to
follow and more
entertaining than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings"</a>
was even shortly after LotR was written.

Well, I'm a 44 years old man, but I accepted my own challenge…

Discord: Does everypony want to hear a scary story?

The rest: "yes", "sure"

Discord: Alright! So Emma Watson and Kim Kardashian were sitting on
a bench at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin_Square">Rabin Square</a>
in Tel Aviv, going over their social media backlog.

Emma and Kim are sitting and using their smartphones.

]

Emma: Hey Kim, check this out: “Basically, there were two sides to the world. There was the entire computer games software industry engaged in a tremendous effort to stamp out piracy, and there was Wobbler. Currently, Wobbler was in front.” [ <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=only-you-can-save-mankind--two-sides">Reference: Terry Pratchett</a> ]

Kim: heh, good one.

[ Princess Celestia gallops behind the bench carrying a human boy on her back.

She stops and the boy unmounts.

]

Boy: thanks for the ride, your highness [he walks away].

Princess Celestia: my pleasure.

Emma: hey, Princess C, can I ride you now?

Kim: can I? I'll give you 1,000 dollars!

Emma: 2,000!

Kim: 3,000!

Princess Celestia: hold your ponies, guys. Let me summon
some Evil arbiters.

+++: Hey, Vader, please come here for a moment.

Darth Vader and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haman">Haman</a>

Cut to the Equestrian bonfire

Discord: and so we'll never know who would have solved
the first one thousand
<a href="https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/faq.html#what_are_ms_deals">Microsoft FreeCell
deals</a> first - Emma Watson or Kim Kardashian… muahahaha.

Apple Bloom: fun story, Uncle Discord, but it wasn't really scary.

Applejack: yeah! Not scary, but fun.

Discord: fair enough… I guess one should look at the full half of the glass.

[

He snaps his fingers, and a glass of juice with a straw materialises.

Discord drinks the bottom half, and the upper half floats in mid-air.
