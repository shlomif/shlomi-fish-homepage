<p> 
Perl has a module called CPAN with which one can install CPAN modules along
with all of the modules they depend on. To invoke it type <tt>perl -MCPAN -e
shell</tt> at the command line while being a super-user, and follow the
instructions it gives you. The <tt>install</tt> command can be used to
automatically install modules. For example: to install the XML::XSLT module,
the following can be done from the CPAN prompt:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
cpan&gt; install XML::XSLT
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
This will in turn install "XML::Parser" and other modules it needs.

<h2 id="cpanplus">CPANPLUS.pm</h2>

<p>
CPANPLUS.pm is a more modern, modular, and enhanced alternative to
CPAN.pm. It is part of perl-5.10.x and above, but can be installed separately.
As such, its use is more recommended.

<h2 id="distro-specific">Operating System/Distribution - Specific Ways</h2>

<p>
Normally, you should look for a suitable native package of the CPAN module 
for your operating system or 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">distribution</a>. If 
that fails, you should consider building your own package. Consult your
distribution's help channels for more information.
