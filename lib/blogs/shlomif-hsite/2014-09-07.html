The set of screenplays
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/">“The Muppet Show:
The Next Incarnation”</a> is me taking the initiative for writing screenplays
for a new incarnation of The Muppet Show. Currently, there’s a mostly
complete <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Summer-Glau-and-Chuck-Norris.html">episode</a>
with Chuck Norris and Summer Glau as two ruthless Grammar Nazis,
another incomplete
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Harry-Potter.html">episode</a>
hosting some of the characters of Harry Potter,
and a preliminary-stages
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Jennifer-Lawrence.html">episode</a>
with Jennifer Lawrence (crossing Silver Linings Playbook, The Hunger Games,
and her personal life.

<blockquote>
<p><b>“Meet Chuck”</b></p>
<p>
[
The Muppet Show Theatre backstage. Kermit and Fozzy are there.
</p>
<p>ChuckN (= Chuck Norris) enters through the door.

]
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Kermit:</strong> Oh hello, Mr. Norris. We’re so glad
to have you here, and we would
love to learn more about you.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">ChuckN:</strong> Thank you, Kermit. You can learn more about me from my 500-page
autobiography, which took me an hour to write, and from the comprehensive
book of Factoids about me, of which I wrote every one.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Fozzy:</strong> Funny! Funny!
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">ChuckN:</strong> Indeed. Anyway, I invited a friend of mine, who is even crazier than I
am, to join us.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Kermit:</strong> Really, who is this crazy guy?
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">ChuckN:</strong> Actually, it’s a crazy girl.
</p>
<p>
[
    SGlau (= Summer Glau) jumps from above the frame to the upper row and then down to where
    Kermit and Fozzy are standing. Applause. She is wearing a grey, military-like
    vest with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper">zipper</a> at
    the front.
]
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Kermit:</strong> Oh, nice to see you here, Ms. Glau.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Shut up, Mr. Frog! I’m here on a mission from the Grammar God. Herr
Norris and I are loyal servants of Grammar Nazism, which aims to unite Grammar
Europe under the reign of the Third Grammar Reich.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">ChuckN and SGlau:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[in unison]</span> Hail Grammar!
</p>
<p>
[
    Miss Piggy is walking on the upper row with a fellow pig.
]
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Miss Piggy:</strong> Well, I don’t think that Miss Mousy is prettier than me.
</p>
<p>
[
    A shot sounds and Miss Piggy's hat is blown away. Cut to SGlau who is
    holding a gun in her left hand.
]
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> That was a warning shot, Fräulein Piggy. For your information, it should
be “is prettier than <strong class="bold">I</strong>”.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">ChuckN and SGlau:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[in unison]</span> Hail Grammar!
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Let’s go.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> By the way, herr Frog: it is not that hard to be green.
</p>
<p>
[
    They go out of the frame.
]
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Kermit:</strong> Meep. I have a bad feeling about all that.
