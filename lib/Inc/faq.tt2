<p>
Lawrence Lessig gives many good reasons for remixing in
his book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_%28book%29"><i><b>Remix:</b>
Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy</i></a>, which I have read
and enjoyed. Writing fan-fiction and crossovers, whether in fiction or
in non-fiction (see some of my crossover essays), is the writing equivalent of
what he describes being primarily done with music and videos.
</p>

<p>
Our aversion towards fan fiction and an insistence on "originality" is mostly
a 20th century fad, that is slowly (for some values of "slowly") diminishing.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the various fiction franchises and idea systems that influenced me
are a large part of me, and I cannot throw them away when writing my own
works. I don’t have a lot of control of the ideas I come up with, but I know
I must materialise them eventually.

<p>
I feature or reference several celebrities in my stories (whether past
or present) as a way of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_person_fiction">Real
person fiction</a>. According to the wikipedia page, such fiction is likely
to be legal if it is done in mostly good taste, which I believe and hope is
the case for me.
</p>

<p>
The general consensus is that a celebrity generally allows himself or herself
to be a subject of reuse in literature, and that includes me, Shlomi Fish.
</p>

<p>
<b>Update (02 November 2019):</b> I have now written a <a
href="[% base_path %]philosophy/culture/my-real-person-fan-fiction/">more
comprehensive essay</a> about why writing real person fan fiction is good.
</p>

<p>
<b>Update (26 November 2019):</b> I now realise that fan fiction and
especially real person fiction can be used to help combat the flood of
new characters and names that plagues many more-"original" stories. People
generally have a rough concept of what characters such as
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/">Chuck Norris</a>,

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Piggy">Miss Piggy</a>, are
like and generally can better remember them because they thought about them
a lot.

In my screenplay <a

As a retort, she exclaims: “Mighty Klingon vampire

[% BLOCK avoiding_non_helpful_criticism %]

<p>
If you do not like a work, please try to comment on why you think it is
lacking, rather than completely dismissing it or vaguely criticising it.
Some examples for such non-helpful criticism are:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
"It sucks."
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
"You cannot write."
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
"It’s a waste of space."
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
"Try to write it as if you were there."

</ul>

People are often amazed by food reviewers in the recently
trendy <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television#Reality_competition/game_shows">cooking
competition ("reality") shows</a> being very pedantic and pinpointing small and
large problems, but it comes with experience and "with the territory". So I
applaud these reviewers.
</p>

<p>
One tip I can offer for dealing with critics who only provide vague
criticism is to ask them to point out <b>one</b> specific issue.

Note that I employed this strategy, in real life, with an Internet friend of
mine who is a retired Finnish software developer in his 40s, who lives in a
small Finnish town. He shared some poems he wrote and I and other chat
participants commented what we liked or disliked about them. His poetry did
improve mostly consistently and… he now has a young woman living with him. I do
not know what she thinks about his poems, but he's <a

[% INCLUDE avoiding_non_helpful_criticism %]

<p>
Telling a contributor why you dislike their work will make reworked and future
works better, and your own future job easier. Reportedly, film studios often
silently dismissed screenplays that they received. I recently submitted my <a
href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Harry-Potter.html">Sesame
Street / "Harry Potter"</a> crossover screenplay to <a
href="https://www.sesameworkshop.org/">the Sesame Workshop</a> and received no
reply.
</p>

<p>
Another different approach is the canned response. While sometimes useful,
it is often indicative that the <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/02/19/seven-steps-to-remarkable-customer-service/">problem needs to be fixed more permanently</a>.
I also recall being given a list of reasons by a web ad service for why my
site was unacceptable, and they were far too vague.
