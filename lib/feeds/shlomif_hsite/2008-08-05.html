<!-- TITLE=Presenetation Sources, Interviews and updated Resources-->
<p>
In 2004, <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/lkcl/">lkcl</a> wrote
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/article/814.html">an
    article on Advogato saying “Love is Golden: All Ideas Have and Always
    Will be”</a>. For a long time, I’ve been supplying the HTML material
for <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/">my presentations</a>
under permissive, free-content licences, but did not supply the
source code and markup used to generate them. Inspired by the article, I set
to remedy it, and now there are links from the individual presentations
to the source tarballs.
</p>

<p>
Note that some presentations were created using other tools, and so are
not available with their source yet, but hopefully this will be remedied soon,
too.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/interviews/">The two Interviews
    with open-source people</a> were now converted to
XML-Grammar-Screenplay and their source is available on the page.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/software-tools/">Software
    Contruction and Management Tools page</a> was heavily updated.
</p>

<p>
New links have been added to
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/">the
    pages “Against Bad Software”</a>.
</p>

<p>
New film recommendations have been added
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/recommendations/films/">to
    the movie recommendations</a>. Moreover, two new book reviews have
been added:
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/books-recommends/#pragmatic_programmer">about
    “The Pragmatic Programmer”</a> and
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/books-recommends/#extreme_programming_explained">about
    “Extreme Programming Explained”</a>.
</p>

<p>
New links have been added <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/links.html">to
    the links page</a>.
</p>

<p>
New quotes have been added <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">to
    the Fortune Cookie Collection</a>. More information is
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/#web-feed">in
    their web-feeds</a>.
</p>

<p>
There were also internal improvements to the site’s build system making
the building of the DocBook/XML documents and other resources less
error-prone and more powerful and customisable.
