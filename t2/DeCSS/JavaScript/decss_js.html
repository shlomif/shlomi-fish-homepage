<h1>DeCSS for JavaScript</h1>

<h3>A hack of Hackers-IL</h3>


<h2>Congratulations!</h2>

<p>
You have violated the DMCA and have a working DeCSS code inside your
computer’s memory. To run it (and <b>really</b> violate the DMCA) follow the
following instructions:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Make sure your browser has JavaScript enabled.
</li>

<li>
Fill something in the “Input” input box. It should be longer than 128 bytes because CSS
does not encrypts the first 128 bytes in every 2048 block. However, only the first
2048 bytes will be encoded by this implementation.
</li>

<li>
Place a key in the key entry box. It can be any string.
</li>

<li>
Press the “DeCSS!” button.
</li>

<li>
Copy the information from the “Output” input box.
</li>

<li>
All the information is encoded and decoded with C-style escape sequences
(e.g: \n, \000, \a) because it may be binary.
</li>
</ol>

Hackers-IL’s DeCSS for JavaScript is:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
The next logical step in DeCSS accessibility.
</li>
<li>
Another nail in the DMCA coffin.
</li>
<li>
A hack that allows you to induce innocent web-surfers into violating the
DMCA on their home computer.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Hackers-IL</h3>

<p>
Hackers-IL is a mailing-list dedicated to the discussion of various topics
that are related to computers. (with a very broad definition of “related”).
The majority of the members of Hackers-IL are professional IT workers and
wannabe philosophers.
</p>

<p>
Most of the Hackers-IL are either Israelis, or people who are affiliated with
Israel in some way. You are welcome to join the mailing list if you enjoy
hacking, and are tolerable of some various Israelist idioms.
</p>

<p>
Even those who are not members may check out the
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/">
homepage of the mailing-list
</a> at <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Groups</a> and enjoy the
nonsense that we discuss.
</p>

<h3>DeCSS for JavaScript</h3>

<p>
DeCSS for JavaScript was a hack that came up in the Hackers-IL’s discussions.
The source code itself was never posted to the mailing-list (and should not be),
but some of the coordination took place there.
</p>

<p>
DeCSS was the topic of discussion in some threads before, and in
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/910">one message</a>,
it was Chen’s suggestion that it should be written in JavaScript.
It was mostly ignored, until Shlomi Fish realized it could actually be
a good idea™ to do so, and he started working on this hack.
