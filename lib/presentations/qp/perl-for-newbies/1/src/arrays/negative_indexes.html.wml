<p>
The expression <code>$myarray[-$n]</code> is equivalent to
<code>$myarray[scalar(@myarray)-$n]</code>. I.e: subscripts with negative indexes
return  the <code>$n</code>'th element from the end of the array. So to get the
value of the last element you can write <code>$myarray[-1]</code> and for the
second last <code>$myarray[-2]</code>,
etc.

<p>
Note that one should also make sure that array subscripts that are continuously
decremented will not underflow below 0, or else one will start getting the
elements from the end of the array.
