Joel Spolsky had previously published an essay titled
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ResumeRead.html">“Getting
Your Résumé Read”</a> on his <i>Joel on Software</i> site, which gives very good
advice for job candidates
who want to apply for work. Today, I am going to cover the opposite direction:
give some advice for employers who publish job ads in hopes of finding
employees. I have seen my share of bad practises among the many job ads
I have read, and can tell which ones make me more willing to apply.
</p>

<p>
Before I start, I am going to share a small item, which I originally planned
to publish as is, and later decided to expand into this post, and which I have
titled “The Worst Job Offer Ever”. After I wrote it, I thought that posting
something like that online will make no one want to hire me ever again,
so don’t take it too seriously. I am not singling any particular “wanted”
adverts (but note that I read a very bad ad that came fairly close, after
I wrote the feature).

I hope you agree that it is pretty bad. Now for the rest of the advice:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
The first thing you should do is to <b>spell the requirements precisely</b>.
What does the candidate <b>must</b> know for the job? Please consider avoiding
giving a number of years of experience because this is annoying.
</p>

<ul>
<li>

<blockquote cite="">

<p>
I saw a job post the other day. 👔
</p>

<p>
It required 4+ years of experience in FastAPI. 🤦
</p>

<p>
I couldn't apply as I only have 1.5+ years of experience since I created that thing. 😅
</p>

<p>
Maybe it's time to re-evaluate that "years of experience = skill level". ♻
</p>

who was happily employed at the time. )
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
I also recall being told of job ads requiring <q>3 years of experience in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2000">Windows 2000</a></q>
in 2001, or something along these lines.
</p>
</li>

</ul>
</li>


<li>
<p>
You should also <b>give a precise description</b> of the job: something
like “Django expert”, “Perl expert”, “UNIX Systems Administrator”,
“PHP expert” etc. That way people who do not match this description will
know better than to apply.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
You should also use <b>proper spelling</b>, grammar, and syntax. Perl is not
spelled
<a href="http://perl-begin.org/learn/Perl-perl-but-not-PERL/">“PERL”</a>,
Python is not spelled “PYTHON”, and it's MySQL - not “MYSQL”, “Mysql” or
“mySQL”. It's also “PHP” - not “Php” or “php”.
</p>
</li>

[% IF 0 %]

<li>
<p>
If you have a successful business or planning on having one, then you should
get your own
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS domain</a>
such as <code>mycompany.com</code>, set up E-mail hosting for it, and send the job
posts from there. Sending
from a Webmail provider such as “@gmail.com”, “@hotmail.com” or “@yahoo.com”
will make a bad impression, and indicate lack of professionalism.
</p>
</li>

[% END %]

<li>
<p>
You should also <b>use a standard desktop, or a comfortable laptop
computer</b> to type
and phrase the message - not a mobile device which results in more error-prone
and less
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_%28technology%29">Netiquette</a>
-conforming messages. Make sure that your E-mail lacks any of the branding
or advertising signatures such as “Sent from my iPhone”.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
<b>Specify the formats</b> in which it is possible to send the résumé, for
example Microsoft Word, OpenDocument Text, XHTML, or PDF. See
my <a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/computers/web/choice-of-docs-formats/">“Choice of Document Formats” page</a>
for an overview and some recommendations.  This way the candidates will know
which formats they should send and you will have less problems reading their
E-mails. That is one thing the worst job advert I gave did right, but naturally
many people will appreciate the ability to send in different formats to the
proprietary Microsoft Word format.
</p>

<p>
Also specify whether it would be possible to send a link to an online version
of the résumé for easy viewing using your favourite browser, and avoid the
hassles of opening attachments and their myriad formats.
</p>
</li>

[% IF 0 %]
<li>
<p>
Please don't require an “ability to work under pressure”. Most developers are
naturally going to perform worse under pressure, and you should make sure
you avoid pressuring them as much as possible. In order to attract developers,
it is a good idea to advertise
that your company normally operates on no more than 40 hours of work in
a week — see what Evan Robinson has written about it in
<a href="http://www.igda.org/why-crunch-modes-doesnt-work-six-lessons">“Why
Crunch Modes Doesn’t Work: Six Lessons”</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you do have a pressured environment (which is unfortunate but a fact
of life), say “We have a pressured environment.” instead.
</p>

</li>

[% END %]

<li>
<p>
Another good idea is to encourage candidates to show off their <b>open-source
projects</b> and web-presence (home sites, blogs, etc.). However, “show me
your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a> page” may
work for some people, but may leave a bad taste in the mouth, and will
offend some other people, because some people prefer some of its alternatives.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
You should spell <b>the location</b> of your offices (at least roughly) and
specify how much one can
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommuting">telecommute</a>, if at
all.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Whatever you do, please don’t post the job ad to the same forum more than
once every few months. Posting the exact same position several times will
make people annoyed and they may complain, filter your messages, or request
that you get banned from posting on the forum.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
It is a good idea to mention some of the <b>software management practices</b>
your
company employs, such as using version control, writing automated tests,
performing code reviews, refactoring, or pair programming.
( See <a href="https://github.com/shlomif/Freenode-programming-channel-FAQ/blob/master/FAQ_with_ToC__generated.md#what-are-some-best-practices-in-programming-that-i-should-adopt">“What are some best practices in programming that I should adopt?”</a>. )
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Finally, as Joel mentions in the original essay, you should make your ad
<b>stand out</b>. One <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/israelrb/msg/29e6f84804a877f7?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain&amp;noredirect">good
example</a> for this was once posted to the Israeli Ruby developers mailing
list:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Subject: Developers Developers Developers

Looking for developers who:

* want a full time, salaried position
* want to work in a fun, young workplace
* want to work in an environment that allows them to use (just about)
whatever tools they wish to get the job done
* know and love ruby
* ideally have experience with php and python
* want to work on large scale rails/merb projects that have nothing to
do with "the social web"
* want to drown a puppy every time they hear phrases like "the social
web"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This job ad (and especially the two last items) makes a stance, and makes
the readers feel empathic towards it.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Good luck!
