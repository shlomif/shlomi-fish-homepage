<p>
Standard CPAN and CPAN-like Perl packages contain their tests as a group
of <tt>*.t</tt> under the sub-directory <tt>t/</tt> and allow running them
by invoking the <tt>make test</tt> or <tt>./Build test</tt> commands.
</p>

<p>
Using the CPAN package 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Starter/">Module-Starter</a>
one can generate a skeleton for one’s own CPAN-like package, that 
can have tests to afterwards. Keeping your code organised in such packages
allows one to make use of the rest of the convenience of using a build-system
such as <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Build/">Module-Build</a>, 
to package it as operating-system-wide packages, which can be removed
easily and to later upload them to CPAN for sharing with other users
and developers.

<p>
Here’s an example of testing a CPAN distribution from CPAN using 
<tt>./Build test</tt>:
