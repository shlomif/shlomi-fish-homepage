As an example, we can imagine a young girl to write a funny screenplay
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a> or Google Docs which pits
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Emma-Watson/">Emma Watson</a> vs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a>
on who gets to ride <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Princess_Celestia">Princess Celestia</a> (= an intelligent, talking, pony horse)
next,
with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader">Darth Vader</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haman">Haman</a>
as two "evil", but mutually hating one another, arbiters. Might seem ridiculous,
but if I didn't want entertainment in my life, then I'd go watch grass grow.
It will be a legal and "ethical" minefield, but I'd bet it'd be easier to
follow and more
entertaining than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings"</a>
was even shortly after LotR was written.

Well, I'm a 44 years old man, but I accepted my own challenge…

Discord: Does everypony want to hear a scary story?

The rest: "yes", "sure"

a bench at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin_Square">Rabin Square</a>
in Tel Aviv, going over their social media backlog.

Emma and Kim are sitting and using their smartphones.

]

Emma: Hey Kim, check this out: “Basically, there were two sides to the world. There was the entire computer games software industry engaged in a tremendous effort to stamp out piracy, and there was Wobbler. Currently, Wobbler was in front.” [ <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=only-you-can-save-mankind--two-sides">Reference: Terry Pratchett</a> ]

Kim: heh, good one.

[ Princess Celestia (= an intelligent, talking, pony horse) gallops behind the
bench carrying a human boy on her back.

She stops and the boy unmounts.

]

Boy: thanks for the ride, your highness [he walks away].

Princess Celestia: my pleasure.

Emma: hey, Princess C, can I ride you now?

Kim: can I? I'll give you 1,000 dollars!

Emma: 2,000!

Kim: 3,000!

Princess Celestia: hold your ponies, guys. Let me summon
some Evil arbiters.

+++: Hey, Vader, please come here for a moment. [She whistles.]

[

Darth Vader and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haman">Haman</a>
enter the frame.

]

Vader: Greetings, your highness. How can Haman and I help?

Princess Celestia: Can you please decide who of Emma and Kim here
is going to ride me first?

Vader: Sure… how about they do a Chess match?

Haman: Checkers! I hate Chess.

Vader: you do? Then how about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_II"><i>Street Fighter II</i></a>?

Haman: I prefer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat"><i>Mortal Kombat</i></a>!

Vader: Next thing you'd tell me you don't like
<a href="https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/faq.html#what_is_solitaire">single-player
card games, also known as "Solitaires"</a>!

Haman: actually, I'm partial to <a href="https://cards.fandom.com/wiki/FreeCell">Freecell</a>…

Vader: Really? So am I!

+++: OK, the first woman to have solved the first 1,000
<a href="https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/faq.html#what_are_ms_deals">Microsoft FreeCell
deals</a> …

Haman: …in order, and without using <a href="https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/links.html#other_solvers">an automated solver</a>!

Vader: yeah, - shall ride Princess Celestia next!

Kim: Sounds good.

[Emma and Kim start playing.]

Haman: by the way, Vader, I also like the Solitaire game <a href="https://cards.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Simon">Simple Simon</a>.

Vader: Get out!

+++: Haman, <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)">this seems
like the beginning of a beautiful friendship</a>.

[Vader and Haman walk away.]

Discord's voice: Princess Celestia waited and waited.

+++: Actually, she waited for less than a minute, and then cast a spell that made
Kim and Emma forget what they were competing for, opened a portal back to
Equestria, and stepped through. [Princess Celestia is seen grinning and chuckling.]

+++: Emma and Kim kept playing Freecell for 10 more minutes, at which point
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a> came.

Shlomi: hey Kim, hey Em! Let's return to <a href="https://shlomif.fandom.com/wiki/Olamot_Con">the con</a> now.

Kim: not now, Shlomi. Emma and I are competing for who will solve the first
1,000 Microsoft FreeCell deals first. In order, and without using an automated
solver.

Shlomi: Really? That should take you at least a few good hours. Surely you
remember that from us collaborating on <a href="https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">fc-solve</a> [References: <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/multiverse-cosmology/#slayer-watcher-whicher">Emma Watson</a> ; <a href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1487837841589743622">Kim Kardashian</a>].

Emma: Yes, you're right. Kim, do you remember what we were competing for?

Kim: No…

Emma: Oh well… Let's head over back to the convention then.

[They go.]

Cut to the Equestrian bonfire.

]

Discord: and so we'll never know who would have solved
the first one thousand
<a href="https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/faq.html#what_are_ms_deals">Microsoft FreeCell
deals</a> first - Emma Watson or Kim Kardashian… muahahaha.

Apple Bloom: fun story, Uncle Discord, but it wasn't really scary.

Applejack: yeah! Not scary, but fun.

Discord: fair enough… I guess one should look at the full half of the glass.

[

He snaps his fingers, and a glass of juice with a straw materialises.

Discord drinks the bottom half, and the upper half floats in mid-air.

]

Fluttershy: I know a story… a joke… not scary, but hopefully fun and funny.

+++: So they hold a contest to see which intelligence agency can
find a rabbit in a forest as quickly as possible… [ <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=the-cia-vs-the-kgb-vs-the-shin-bet">Continuation</a> ]
