<p>
This informal screenplay (which was not produced or filmed yet) is surrealist
realism, and takes place in the spring-summer of 2013. It is far-fetched, but
could actually happen.

<b>Note:</b> while considering myself a mostly Objectivist, and while I enjoyed
reading <i>The Fountainhead</i> and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>, I reject
Classical Randianism as unfitting for 2013 and forward, and
