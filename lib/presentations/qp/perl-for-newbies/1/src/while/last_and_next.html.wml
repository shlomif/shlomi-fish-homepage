<p>
Within the <tt>while</tt> and <tt>for</tt> loops one can use two special 
commands, called <tt>last</tt> and <tt>next</tt>. <tt>last</tt> terminates a 
loop  prematurely while <tt>next</tt> skips the rest of the remaining loop 
body, skips to the loop condition and if it is met, executes the loop again.
</p>

<p>
By default, <tt>last</tt> and <tt>next</tt> operate on the most innermost loop.
However, the loop to which they relate can be controlled by labeling 
the requested loop and specifying this label as a parameter to <tt>last</tt>
or <tt>next</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The following example is a rewrite of the "All A's" program using 
<tt>last</tt>:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/while/all_as_with_last.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<hr />

<p>This program prints a left-tilted pyramid:</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/while/pyramid1.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
"ROW_LOOP" is the label for the outer loop, and it can be seen that 
<tt>next</tt> uses it as a parameter. All in all, <tt>next</tt> and 
<tt>last</tt> are sometimes very convenient (but don't tell it to 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_Dijkstra">Edsger W. 
Dijkstra</a>'s face!), so you will see them being used often.
