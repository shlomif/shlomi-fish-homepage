    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
        When <ulink url="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky 
            ("Joel on Software")</ulink> wrote his notorious blog post
        <ulink url="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01.html">"Language
            Wars"</ulink>, many people asked whether he has "jumped the
        shark" and that his blog will go downhill from there. I too have read
        the post, and agreed, that while it had a few good points, it was
        too based on "feeling rather than knowing". Joel later on posted
        many good articles and shorter entries on his blog, but many people
        still recallled it as a very low-point in the blog.
    </para>

    <para>
        Like Joel, I have a home-site and several blogs, where I post articles
        and essays about my thoughts, and this time I've decided to risk
        something similar to what Joel has done on an equally flamatory topic:
        <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_licence">licences
            of open-source software</ulink>. I'm going to introduce the various
        options, explain a little about their history and motivation and then
        give some advice according to my own personal opinion.
    </para>

    <para>
        I should note that I am not a lawyer, and only write this according
        to my best knowledge, understanding and experience.
        <footnote id="ianal" title="IANAL">
            <para>
                Some people believe that discussing legal matters should be
                reserved to people who are Law experts. However, this is
                a <ulink url="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=39148&amp;cid=62149">sub-case 
                    of the "only specialists should deal with a
                specialised field" fallacy</ulink>.
            </para>
            <para>
                Like it or not, the Law affects us all and the Government
                expects common citizens to be aware of it and not violate
                it, even if they are not lawyers. As software developers, we
                do not limit discussions on software and computing to people
                with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (much less a
                Ph.D. or whatever) and often not-too-qualified people can be
                very knowledgable and/or productive.
            </para>
            <para>
                Similarly, I expect discussions on the governmental law to
                have a lower barrier for entry than people who are qualified 
                lawyers, or Law Professors.
            </para>
        </footnote>
        I think what I'm writing here is correct, but would still appreciate
        any correction for future versions. If you're unsure about my advice,
        then my advice to you is to consult a legal expert (if you
        can afford one) or your local or global Free and Open Source Software
        organisation. I cannot guarantee my advice is valid.
    </para>
    <section id="spoiler">
        <title>Spoiler</title>

        <para>
            In this spoiler I'll explain what I'm using right away, which is
            also what I recommend other people to use. When I started
            releasing my code as open-source software, I used <ulink 
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">the 
                Public Domain</ulink>. So, for example,
            <ulink url="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</ulink>
            which is one of my earliest projects and still one
            of the most successful, still carries <ulink url="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/fc-solve/trunk/fc-solve/source/COPYING?rev=705&amp;view=log">a 
                <filename>COPYING</filename> file</ulink> with the 
                following contents:
        </para>
        <blockquote>
            <para>
                Relax, this is not GPL software, but rather it is distributed
                under the public domain. It means it can be linked against
                anything, converted to any different license, freely used and
                distributed, and anything else without any restrictions 
                whatsoever. No Strings Attached!â„¢
            </para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>
            (This was also a joke of sorts.)
        </para>

        <para>
            Later on, to avoid the problematic status of public domain code
            in many countries, and to avoid other potential legal problems,
            I started distributing my original code under <ulink 
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_license">the 
                MIT X11 Licence</ulink>, a BSD-style licence which is the 
            closest one to the Public Domain. If the project I'm
            contributing to has a different licence, then I disclaim any
            explicit or implicit ownership on the code I wrote, and allow
            the existing copyright holders to do with my code as they see
            fit.
        </para>

        <para>
            Note that I'm using different terms for other types of
            digital artworks. Most of my essays (including this one) are
            under the <ulink url="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative 
                Commons Attribution Licence</ulink>, my original (i.e: 
            non-derived-work or fan-art) fictitious stories are under 
            <ulink url="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">the 
                Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike Licence</ulink>
            (which is more GPL-like), and most of the
            photos I took and published were placed under the Public Domain.

    <title>History and Overview of Common Licences</title>

    <section id="history--public-domain">
        <title>In the Beginning - there was the Public Domain</title>

        <para>
            As computers became more popular after World War II, people
            started writing software for them and sometimes distributing it. 
            This software written in Machine code, Assembly, or more portable
            high-level programming languages, enabled people other than
            the original author to run the code and make use of it. 
            The traditional "licence" for such software was 
            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">the 
                Public Domain</ulink>, which is a legal term in the United 
            States and other countries that describes what becomes of
            an intellectual artwork whose (limited) copyright term has
            expired. As traditionally understood, a Public Domain artwork
            can be freely distributed (commercially or non-commercially),
            freely derived from and included in future artworks, and freely
            used and enjoyed. As a result, such software was generally
            free-for-all-to-use.
        </para>

        <para>
            That's not all. In fact, as many computer workers at that point 
            in hisotry understood, it was unnaturaly for software to be
            copyrighted and be under any licence besides the Public Domain.
            Evidence for this can be found in <ulink 
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists">Bill
                Gates' "Open Letter to (Altair) Hobbyists"</ulink>,
            where he expressed dismay on them contacting him about copying
            his company's version of BASIC for the Altair (an early home
            computer), instead of buying it for money.
        </para>

        <para>
            Non-public-domain software (from now on "proprietary" or 
            "non-free" software) actually preceded Gates, and was common on
            mainframe (LINK) or mini-computers (LINK), which were the
            very big (and in today's standards' - incredibly under-equiped)
            computers that preceded the now common microprocessor-based.
            However, there was still a strong tradition of what we now
            called open-source software back then. See for example,
            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHARE_%28computing%29">the
            SHARE group that shared software for IBM-based computers</ulink>.

    <section id="history--unix-and-bsd">
        <title>AT&amp;T UNIX, BSD, and the BSD Licence</title>
        <para>
            The original UNIX was an operating system originally created by 
            AT&amp;T's
            Bell Labs Workers for Digital Equipment Corporation's (LINK) 
            PDP-11 (LINK) computers, based on earlier
            efforts, which was distributed along with its source code in
            the C programming language to interested parties across the
            world. 
        </para>
        <para>
            One of the hallmarks of AT&amp;T UNIX was that despite the fact
            that its source code was not fully-open-source (see below)
            in today's standards, it was still a fully functional operating
            system distributed along with its source, which rapidly gained
            popularity.
        </para>
        <para>
            Eventually, several workers in the University of California 
            in Berkeley started working on their own version of Unix, based
            on AT&amp;T's. This was called "Berkeley Software Development"
            or BSD for short. The licence for its original parts became
            known as
            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bsd_license">the 
                BSD Licence (or BSDL or even "BSD" for short)</ulink>
            and according to its popular distribution was public-domain-like
            in the sense that it allowed free modification, redistribution,
            and conversion of derived code to any different licence. 
        
            <footnote id="bsd-licences-footnote" title="OrigBSDL">
                <para> 
                    The
                    original BSD licence had an "advertising clause" that
                    required the one who distributes or modify the code to
                    advertise its use by the copyrights holder. This clause was
                    later deamed as undesirable, and non-GPL-compatible by the
                    Free Software Foundation due to the proliferation of people
                    that require attribution. Therefore, it is now recommended
                    to use the so-called "Modified BSD Licence" with 3-clauses
                    or the further modified one with 2-clauses, which are both
                    GPL-compatible.

            </footnote>
        </para>
        <para>
            The BSD licence has proved to be popular for other software
            written for UNIX-like operating systems (and open-source 
            software in general). Later on, several variations on this
            licence were initiated and also become popular.

            Stallman opted against using the BSD licence for the original

            The GPL is a relatively complex licence with many fine points.
            I admit that I did not fully understand version 2.0 of the GPL

            The GNU Project began to work on software programs and libraries
            to replace or complement, existing ones in the proprietary UNIX
            world, and most of them were placed under the GPL. The GPL
            was adopted for other software released on the Internet and
            elsewhere for Unix and non-Unix operating systems, but some
            people still released software under public-domain-like licences,
            such as the BSDL, the licence of the MIT X Window System 
            (so-called MITL, MIT, X11L or X11) and the pure Public Domain.
