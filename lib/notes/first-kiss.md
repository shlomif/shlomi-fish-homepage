More impressions from the trip and this time something that I'd already told in private or semi-private, but I'd like to make more public: my first kiss, with a girl, and on the lips. It happened on the Saturday during which the convention took place and despite the fact that that girl was almost the exact opposite of what I consider my type, and that I was kinda forced into it ("rape-kissed"), it felt pretty good.

First  of all my type of girls are:

1. White ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race ) or with Asian / Oriental features, though I admit that I found some Black celebrities very attractive too (e.g:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna ).

2. Not overly big. Petite is fine, but can also be larger.

3. Muscular, athletic, and without too much excess fat, e.g: https://twitter.com/Athletic_Babes

4. An "alpha female": the insurgent, rebellious, independent, "bad girl", awe-inspiring, sexy, exciting, girl, who can get out of any trouble she may get into and keeps challenging social norms. Akin to Westley Snipes in http://www.ericsink.com/entries/hg_denzel.html , or Milady de-Winter in The Three Musketters.

5. Attractive enough and groomed enough.

Now on with the story: at the Saturday during the long weekend in which the Nine Worlds GeekFest​ took place, I decided to walk all the way to a nearby gas station and buy myself a nice drink and a sandwich. I ended up buying a drink, a small wrap package, etc. using my credit card, and I sat down to enjoy them at a nearby bus station.

At that point I was approached by a young girl who was Black, big, fat and with too small a T-shirt so her belly was partly exposed, who told me she need 10 £ to buy some medicine to relieve a headache. She was going to be my first kiss.

Now we tried various ways of getting the money like using the ATM at the gas station with my card, asking the cashiers at the gas station's store to charge my credit card and give us the money, or asking people to use their own credit card. Eventually, I was able to use the ATM machine back at the hotel where the con took place and extract 20 £ out of it, and give it to the girl, and she was so happy that she ended up kissing me.

She was too strong (or at least too heavy) to resist, and having recalled what I had written in https://plus.google.com/+ShlomiFish/posts/3PVhg1H6qqT about not resisting getting raped and thus enjoying it better, I did not really resist, and it felt good in a way. (No tongues were involved.).

After the kiss, we went to some trouble to get her to call her family on my mobile phone, but we were able to eventually (I'm still not fluent with operating my new Android-based smartphone).

Anyway, on all the way, I learned more about her like the fact that she was born in the states, and that her father was Jewish, and naturally her given name (which I won't tell here to avoid sharing incriminating details).

We parted way, and I haven't had too much sexual/romantic interest in her to permanently enter into a relationship with her, but I kinda feel perhaps it was what God (however manifested) intended for me as my first kiss.
