<p>
This is a Perl CPAN distribution that implements a command line application,
which delays for a given number of seconds (similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_(command)">UNIX sleep</a> command),
but while displaying the remaining time in seconds. Using the <code>--to</code>
flag, it is also possible to specify an end time in the future.
