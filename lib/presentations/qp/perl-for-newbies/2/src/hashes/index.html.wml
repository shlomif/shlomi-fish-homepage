<p>
Hashes can be used to map a set of keys, each to his own value. Using a
hash one can retrieve the value associated with each key, as well as get
a list of all the keys present in the hash.
</p>

<p>
To assign or retrieve the value of the key <tt>$mykey</tt> in the hash 
<tt>$myhash</tt> one uses the <tt>$myhash{$mykey}</tt> convention. To check if a
key exists in a hash one should type <tt>exists($myhash{$mykey})</tt> 
which in turn returns a boolean value that corresponds to its existence.
</p>

<p>
An array whose elements are the keys present in the hash can be retrieved 
by typing <tt>keys(%myhash)</tt>. Here's a short example, that runs a simple 
bank, that will illustrate this functionality:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/hashes/bank.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
The following example, which is considerably shorter, uses a hash to
find out if a list of strings contains only unique strings:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/hashes/unique.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>
