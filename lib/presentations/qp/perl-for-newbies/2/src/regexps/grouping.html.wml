<p>
One can use the cluster grouping notation (<tt>(?: ... )</tt>) or the 
capture grouping notation (<tt>( ... )</tt>) to group several characters so
the entire group can be repeated with <tt>+</tt>, <tt>*</tt> or <tt>?</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
The difference between clustering and capturing, is that with capturing the
Perl interpreter also keeps track of the text matched by the captures in the
<tt>$1</tt>, <tt>$2</tt>, <tt>$3</tt>, etc. variables. Clustering as a result
is faster and less intrusive.

<p>
For example, the following perl program sees if its argument is an entire 
sentence that starts with "the" and ends with "there":
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/regexps/sentence.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
It is possible to nest groupings, so for example the following matches a
square brackets-enclosed semicolon separated list of curly braces-enclosed 
comma-separated lists of numbers:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/regexps/semicolons_and_commas.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
So it matches strings like <tt>[{54,129};{236,78}]</tt> and
<tt>[{54,129};{236,78};{78,100,808};{72,1009,8}]</tt>
</p>
