    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
        The purpose of this article is to explain why Internet file
        swapping (of media such as music files, video files, etc.) is moral,
        ethical and should be legal. Plus, people who share files on the
        Internet or download them, must not be prosecuted.

    <title>Debunking Some Misleading Terms</title>
    <para>
        The Human Language is primarily a tool of thought, and only afterward
        a tool of communication. As such, mutations in the meaning of words
        can affect clear thinking about issues. The issue of file swapping
        is no exception. Before we continue, allow me to explain about the
        improper validity or application of some terms.
    </para>
    <section id="term_intellectual_property">
        <title>"Intellectual Property"</title>
        <para>
            As noted by Richard Stallman, <ulink url="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/10/27/189204">the term Intellectual property is a
                seductive mirage</ulink>. Patents, Copyrights, and Trademarks
            are not equivalent to property, not even "intellectual" one.
            Furthermore, they shouldn't be grouped together as they are
            intended for different purposes and do different things. (And are
            treated differently according to law).
        </para>
        <para>
            Some people claim that since a copyrighted work is "intellectual
            property", then copying it is equivalent to "stealing". But that
            is not the case here.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section id="term_stealing_theft">
        <title>"Stealing" or "Theft"</title>
        <para>
            Copyright apologists like to say that copying a work that is
            copyrighted and was published to the public, is equivalent to
            "stealing" or "theft". However, stealing involves taking tangible
            property without permission, and depriving the owner of one less
            instance of it. On the other hand, with a public work, we can
            make an unlimited number of copies, while not harming the original,
            and while respecting the exclusive rights of the author for his
            work. This is because we just copy it - we don't claim it is ours.
        </para>
        <para>
            Accusing people who share or duplicate media non-commercially of
            "stealing" obscures two other forms of media-related crimes that
            are in fact stealing:
        </para>
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    If someone has somehow gained access to my private
                    files and used it to prepare his own copies (or worse
                    delete the originals), then he has performed stealing.
                    Not of "Intellectual Property" but of actual property,
                    because the files are private and I do not wish them
                    to be inspected by someone else. And privacy must be
                    respected.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    If someone has made an inclusive work of someone's
                    else's work, and claimed it was his, then it may be
                    called "stealing" of copyrights.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>
            But copying a work that was released for public consumption, can
            never be considered "stealing". Instead it is merely "copying",
            "swapping", "sharing", etc.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section id="piracy">
        <title>"Piracy"</title>
        <para>
            The term "Piracy" is very common for the action of copying files,
            either for money or free of charge. One thing that should be noted
            about it is that the original pirates were sea-faring robbers, who
            took hold of ships, stole the goods, killed the people who
            were on board, and burned the ships. It would be a bit of a
            stretch to label a 10-years-old child who duplicated a
            CD of Music or several copyrighted files to his friend, after such
            villains.
        </para>
        <para>
            I personally believe that the term "Piracy" in its applied context
            is quite harmless and is cognitively sound. However, I will not
            use the term here below.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section id="crime">
        <title>"Crime"</title>
        <para>
            If one violates the letter of the law of my country did he commit
            a crime? Not necessarily. A crime is an action that is globally
            accepted to be unethical, according to well-defined, absolute
            Ethics.
        </para>
        <para>
            People who hid saved Jews during the Nazi regime, violated the
            law that took place in their lands. But can you call them
            "criminals" with a honest face? Not at all - they were very noble
            people, who did something almost everyone would agree was an
            ethical action.
        </para>
        <para>
            Now, were people who bought Alcoholic beverages during
            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition#United_States">the
                time the U.S.A. had alcoholic prohibition</ulink> criminals?
            Again no. The Law at this point was completely irrational, and so
            the American Government could not have prevented such
            violations, and it was a regulation that the public could not
            withstand.
            <footnote id="benevolent_felons">
                <para>
                    One correspondant to this article complained that I
                    shouldn't have given these two examples, because one cannot
                    compare downloading files to the highly moral acts of the
                    people who hid Jews during the Nazi reign, and because the
                    Prohibition on alcohol was a starting point to the
                    American mafia.
                </para>
                <para>
                    However, this is the <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_over_substance_fallacy">style over substance fallacy</ulink>, where one
                    criticises the style of a writing instead of what it says.
                    My point was to bring two cases where people were acting
                    illegally yet were acting either ethically or just
                    morally, and that the Law was not on Ethics' side in this
                    case.
                </para>
            </footnote>
        </para>
        <para>
            Similarly one cannot argue that people who violate laws that
            prohibit the non-commercial duplication of digital works are
            criminals. Just because the law is there does not necessarily
            make it a right law or a beneficial law. One can argue that these
            people are law-violators (or "Avaryanim" in Hebrew), but that's
            not the same thing as a criminal.
        </para>
        <para>
            Many times in history, acts of civil disobedience proved to be
            beneficial in the long run. The classical example for it is the
            American Revolution, but there are many other examples.
        </para>

    <section id="terms_conclusion">
        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <para>
            In one IRC conversation I had with supporters of actions against
            file sharers, I realised that while I gave a lot of arguments for
            my stance, they had nothing better to do than to repeat the same
            mantras of: "You're stealing someone else's (intellectual) property
            so you are a criminal." or "You're violating the law so you are
            a criminal.", etc. It was obvious that their cognition was
            contaminated with the mis-interpretations of these terms, which
            caused their thoughts and speech to be mutilated as well.
        </para>
        <para>
            Thus, it is high time one eliminates all the mis-applications of
            these terms from his or her vocabulary, because they prevent
            natural thought and growth on the matter.

    <title>Why File Swapping should be Legal?</title>
    <para>
        So why should file swapping be legal? Let's examine the reasons one
        by one.
    </para>
    <section id="why_should_be_legal_not_a_crime">
        <title>It is not a Crime</title>
        <para>
            The primary reason why file swapping should be legal is because
            it's not a crime, at least not an ethical one. Sites or services
            that point to where to download the content are just referencing
            the presence of the information. Referencing or linking is
            <emphasis role="bold">never</emphasis> a crime. It's like
            instructions on how to prepare bombs, where to find illegal drugs,
            how to cheat various systems, where to find stolen goods, etc.
            By itself this information is not a crime to know, because it's
            protected speech. So does pointing to a copyrighted resource.
        </para>
        <para>
            So now we're left with the question whether sharing a copyrighted
            work (or downloading it) is an objectively criminal action. The
            answer is again "no". It's not a crime since the originator of
            a copyrighted work that was made public cannot prevent
            non-commercial copies from being made and distributed. As of today,
            many countries passed such laws, but these laws are unethical.
            Sharing of copyrighted work is common-place, and many of the
            people who do it (including many children) do not feel they're
            doing something wrong, or feel guilty about it. So it is ethical,
            and moral and should be legal.
        </para>
        <para>
            Note that selling copies commercially (as in stores of pirated
            media), can be prohibited by the copyright holder. But
            non-commercial copying (from friend to friend, or via
            Peer-to-Peer services) cannot.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section id="why_should_be_legal_other_ways_to_make_money">
        <title>There are other ways to make money</title>
        <para>
            There are many other ways in which originators of media can make
            money even if they allow free distribution. First of all, they can
            regulate the commercial use of the works. That way, commercial
            entities (such as Music stores, online music download services,
            D.J.'s in charge-for-entrance parties and commercial radio
            stations) must pay them royalties.
        </para>
        <para>
            Another financial option is to restrict derivation of
            the work. That way, persons who wish to build upon the work
            or include substantial parts of it in their own must consult the
            originator.
        </para>
        <para>
            Another option (of less substance) is to require attribution for
            the originator. That way, people who wish to build upon a work
            without crediting the originator must purchase permission from
            him.
        </para>
        <para>
            These three methods together give enough options for an artist
            to make money off his art, without restricting non-commercial
            copying.
        </para>
        <para>
            This is naturally excluding live performances of artists of
            various sorts, like Rock concerts, that are also a huge potential
            source of revenue.

            You've probably all heard stories of the Media organizations'
            witch-hunt against file sharers. From suing a female 12-years-old
            honour student, to a grandpa in his 70's, to a college player of
            American Football. They also were closing many online sites.
            In New Delhi the police gave the media companies an unlimited
            warrant to raid the houses of people suspected of media sharing.

        <para>
            Lots and lots of "1984"-style terror. And for what? For preventing
            the supposed loss of sales by a limited private sector of the
            industry? For preventing a practically costless operation of
            distributing an mp3 that can be done by the "criminals" at the
            comfort of their homes?

            In a presentation he gave, Richard M. Stallman (of the Free
            Software Foundation and GNU project fame) gave another good reason
            why it wasn't unacceptable. He said that when he was a kid in
            school, his teacher asked the children to share their sweets with
            the other  children. And now, suddenly they have to tell them
            something like "No, Tommy, don't share your
            music/software/videos/etc. It's
            illegal!".

            What's a child to feel in this case? Sharing is a nice

            should prevent it, or else we ourselves will become more and more
            selfish.

        <para>
            Let's put things into perspective. What the media companies do
            is sell entertainment to people. Entertainment. They don't save
            lives and the economy does not depend on them, as there are
            many other sources of entertainment a consumer can choose
            instead that are available independently.
        </para>
        <para>
            The worst case (and extremely unlikely) scenario is that no-one
            pays for online media, and everybody just share and download music
            from the Internet. Would that be a bad scenario? No, the world
            will go on. Without people making money off selling media, but
            nevertheless.

    <section id="refuting_common_arguments_domino_effect">
        <title>The Domino Effect</title>
        <para>
            Some people are using "the Domino Effect" as an argument that file
            swapping should be stopped. What they say is that if the
            profitability of the Music industry would be harmed, then it will
            cause an economical chain-reaction that may devastate the rest
            of the economy, because other dependent industries may be harmed.
        </para>
        <para>
            There are two problems with this argument. The first is that there
            is no evidence that the profitability of the music industry is
            harmed due to file swapping, so there is little risk of this
            happening. The other is that assuming that would happen, it won't
            be a bad thing. That's because we essentially reduce the money
            that is transferred to a heavy taxer, and make the public, as a
            whole, richer. The public in turn, can spend this money on other
            merchandise, and make other industries as a whole more
            prosperous. This is similar to reducing income tax, while laying
            off some government workers.

        <title>Violating the Law against File Swapping will Cause

        <para>
            Some people say that if the law of a country prohibits sharing
            files, then this law must be obeyed, because otherwise there
            will be anarchy. However, one must understand that if certain
            laws are irrational, they cannot be practically expected to
            be obeyed.
        </para>
        <para>
            I also personally don't see how assuming everyone share files
            online, the integrity of a country will be harmed. Sharing files
            does not involve killing people, stealing from them, nor does it
            involve force, threat of force or fraud.

        <para>
            The comparison of sharing and downloading files to disobeying
            traffic laws seems to be quite prevalent. But naturally, copying
            files does not endanger lives, nor is it actually a crime. The
            worst thing that can happen if one shares works of art, is loss
            of profit. If you disobey traffic laws, you risk the lives of
            yourself and of other people. This makes it a difference of Heaven
            and Earth in this analogy.

        <para>
            Some people claim that because the main entities that will
            supposedly be harmed from making file swapping legal are media
            conglumerates, and to a lesser extent best-selling artists
            who are very rich, and those who would benefit are the poor
            everyday people, then this is a case of "stealing from the rich
            and giving to the poor.", which is still stealing.

        <para>
            One thing that has to be understood about the Robin Hood myth

            case.
        </para>
        <para>
            Copying a copyrighted work is not stealing, because the money
            that the author can charge for its commercial copying is due
            to copyright law - a civil (not criminal) contract between the
            State and the artists, in order to encourage original creation.
            However, <link linkend="term_stealing_theft">breaking this contract

        </para>
        <para>
            It should be understood that record labels and other distributors
            of entertainment and non-technical media should either adapt to
            the new situation where Internet users can download such files
            for free and enjoy them, and to a greater extent contribute such
            media on their own, without much help from them, or simply perish
            as a no longer necessary establishment, that just gets in the way.

        </para>
        <para>
            However, this results from two confusions. The first is that I
            don't have problems with people re-distributing my work: it is
            all freely re-distributable and a most of it is also Free

    <title>Reflections on Online Music Stores</title>
    <para>
        Lately we've been seeing online music purchasing services such as
        <ulink url="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</ulink>,
        <ulink url="http://www.real.com/musicstore/">Real Music Store</ulink>,
        etc. Such services are a good thing as they allow Media companies to
        make money off selling music files, while allowing users to buy and
        download their favourite songs without too much hassle.
    </para>
    <para>
        Some of these stores attempt to use one of the so-called "Digital
        Rights Management" (or "DRM") systems, to prevent the users from
        making use of the files as is. However, since players to play the
        files are present on the users' computers and these players can
        be reverse engineered, then this offers only fig leaf protection, and
        is just an annoyance. Online stores would do better to avoid such
        schemes altogether and just provide the plain, non-scrambled, music
        files.
    </para>
    <para>
        While online music stores are a good thing, it still doesn't imply
        that file-swapping services like Peer-to-Peer network are
        illegitimate. There is room and legitimacy for both.

    <title>Can File Swapping Really be Stopped?</title>
    <para>
        People who fight file swapping would like to believe it can be

        traffic to the actual Internet is trafficed to different nodes in
        the network, and everything is encrypted, so one cannot determine
        the real origin of the request. If someone uploads a file from
        a Tor node - the file may actually reside on the host of
        a completely different Tor user.

        The measures that copyright conglomerates have taken to try and
        stop file-sharing were appaling. From pulling out file sharing sites
        and services under legal threats, to demanding ISPs to give the
        identities of their file-sharing users (against any reasonable
        measurement of privacy), to prosecuting and harrasing file sharers.
        All of this for fighting against a non-existent loss of profits. Will
        you sell your soul to the Satan in order to sell 1.2 milliard dollars
        instead of 1 milliard?

        Now that the Internet is becoming more and more common and more and

            During ancient times (before the invention of paper, and the

            required a lot of effort to duplicate. As such, the authors

            It was decided that after a limited time when the author or his

            a work. Note that it does not talk about mere duplication. Printing
            and reprinting were at the time very costy operations, produced
            works of good quality, and required a non-negligible amount of

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <para>
        File swapping must be legal, because it's ethical, moral, makes
        economical sense, and is otherwise beneficial for artists,
        distributors and consumers.
    </para>
    <para>
        There's a book on my bookshelf by Ashleigh Brilliant with a very good
        title: "I Feel Much Better, Now that I've Given up Hope". I think this
        is one thing the Media companies don't understand. If they accept
        Internet File Sharing as a necessary "Evil", they will be able to make
        the best out of the new situation. Instead, they have chosen to
        perform a large-scale witch-hunt, which does not really help prevent
        file sharing, and just makes them look like the public enemy.
    </para>
    <para>
        Once the Media companies try to fight file swapping by using lawsuits,
        or threats, then they should be fought back in order to protect the
        people's ethical right to share songs. All laws that are passed to
        prohibit non-commercial distribution of public works, are unethical,
        and should be replaced with more reasonable laws.

        note that the term was already extended several times in the past,
        since the first American copyrights law. 95 years for a copyrights

        A different issue is the <ulink url="http://www.anti-dmca.org/">Digital

        protection (and some say every computer security measure, in general).
        It is actively used to threat to remove allegedly copyrighted content

        <para>
            Shlomi Fish was born in Israel in 1977, and has lived there most of
            his life. He is a user, developer, advocate and activist of
            Open Source Software. His greatest contribution so far in this
            regard has been <ulink url="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell
                Solver</ulink>, a Public Domain Library for solving games
            of Freecell and other types of Solitaire. However, he also
            <ulink url="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/">initiated
                several other projects</ulink> and
            <ulink url="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/contributions/">made
                important contributions to projects he did not initiate</ulink>
            some of them very large scale.
        </para>
        <para>
            Otherwise, Fish has written <ulink url="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/">several
                humorous novellas, stories and aphorisms</ulink>, which he
            has released online, under the CC-by or CC-by-sa licenses. He also
            wrote <ulink url="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/">many
                essays and articles</ulink> as well as
            <ulink url="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/">material
                for presentations</ulink> which (unless specified otherwise)
            were released under the CC-by license.

            To conclude, if you think that "this guy attacks Intellectual
            Property so he obviously doesn't have any significant IP of his
            own", then this myth, in his case, can never be farther than the
            fact.
        </para>
        <para>
            Shlomi Fish is a Jew and an Israeli by nationality, an atheist
            by faith (or lack of it) and a
            <ulink url="http://www.neo-tech.com/neotech/advantages/">Neo-Tech</ulink>
            Objectivist by ideology. As such he is a firm believer in both
            individual rights and freedoms, and freedom from oppression, as well
            as a free economy (Laissez-Faire Capitalism) that is free of
            government intervention. He also does his best efforts to live by
            the values of honesty, integrity, individualism, independent
            thought, passion, and rational self-growth.

                 I'm no expert, but it seems like the MPAA would get a much
                 bigger return on their investment if they stopped going after
                 college students and went after the factories that turn out
                 legitimate movies by day, and switch over to pirated material
                 at night.
