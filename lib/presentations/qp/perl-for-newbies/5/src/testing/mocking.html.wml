When testing certain parts of the application, it is sometimes desirable to
mimic the functionality of different parts, so the testing will be isolated.
For example, if we're testing a server-side script (such as a CGI script),
we may wish to provide a server-emulating object that's completely under
our control and that inputs the script with our own parameters. This is
called <b>mocking</b> (see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">the Wikipedia article
about Mock objects</a>), and there are several mechanisms for doing so
for Perl facilities:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-MockObject/">Test-MockObject</a>
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-MockModule/">Test-MockModule</a>
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-Mock/">DBD-Mock</a> - mock
databases for testing.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
With regard to mocking modules, one may opt to simulate loading a module using
the Perl <tt>%INC</tt> variable (see
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlvar.html">perlvar</a>) by doing
something like:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/testing/MockModules.pm" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
After doing this, the tested code can do <tt>use CGI;</tt> and still think it
loaded the original module, while actually it is using our own mocked
version.
