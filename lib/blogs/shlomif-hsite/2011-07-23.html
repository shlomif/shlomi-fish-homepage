Here are the recent updates for Shlomi Fish’s Homepage. The first highlight is
that I’ve gone over the site and converted most ASCII single quotes and
double quotes I could find to their Unicode equivalents. In the process,
I corrected many typos, XHTML validation problems, and other issues.

<p>
There are new <a

There’s a translation of the
of <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/">Human Hacking
    Field Guide</a> to Written Arabic. This was done by Vieq - thanks!
</p>

<p>
The Hebrew translation of the screenplay
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/humanity/"><i>Humanity - the Movie</i></a> is now complete.

Furthermore, the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/XML-Grammar/Fiction/">XML-Grammar-Fiction page</a> was enhanced with examples and links.

There’s a new
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/Test.pm-Converter/">Test.pm

maintaining legacy Perl code.
