</p>

<h3 id="main_lj"><a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/">Main Weblog at
LiveJournal</a></h3>

<p>
My main weblog of various odds and ends. I’m trying that it won’t be one of
these boring personal blog, but rather one that contains either philosophical
insights, or otherwise personal events that I think are of interest to the
public and provide some insights. It includes some political thoughts
of mine, which I hope are insightful.
</p>

<p>
I used to maintain this blog
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/shlomif/">on Advogato</a>,
and for some time cross-posted entries to both blogs, but no longer do. The
Advogato blog contains many older entries, though.

<p>
A stream of Links I’m posting to del.icio.us (a social bookmarking service).
</p>

<p>
I used to post these links to
<a href="http://www.simpy.com/user/shlomif" id="simpy_links">a similar stream
in Simpy</a> but no longer do, because their RSS feeds were non-valid, which
made it a problem to process them.

Fortune Cookies Collection</a></h3>

<p>
As I add more and more fortunes to my fortune cookies collection, I’m uploading
them to my site, and rendering them into various formats from their XML
source. They also have <a href="$(ROOT)/humour/fortunes/#web-feed">their
own web-feeds</a> for subscribing using a web-feed aggregator.
</p>

<h2 id="aggregated_feeds">Aggregated Feeds</h2>

<p>
I’m providing several aggregated feeds, that combine the items from more
than one of these feeds:
</p>

<ol>
<li>

photos)</b></a>
