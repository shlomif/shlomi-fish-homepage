<p>
Here's what is new on www.shlomifish.org since the last update.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#we_dont_know_his_cellphone_numer">Two new bits</a> were added to the humour collection:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    We don't know his cellphone number, and even if we did, we would tell you 
    that we didn't know it.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Moreover and not-unusually, some new fortune cookies were added to 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">the fortune cookies 
    collection</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The new <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/yjobs-on-mozilla/">yjobs.co.il workaround for 
    Mozilla-based browsers</a> (such as Firefox) workaround may be of interest
to Israeli-based job seekers.
</p>

<p>
Also on the software front, the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/bits.html#xchat_xmms_nowplay">XChat /nowplay script</a> was updated to have <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a> support.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/">The anti-bad-software 
    pages</a> were updated with new links and with other updates.
</p>

<p>
There are new links in <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/links.html">the
    links page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Many non-validating pages (according to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C
standards</a>) were made to validate, and so most of the
site should now be fully valid.
</p>

<p>
Have fun, everybody, and in case it's relevant - happy holidays!
</p>
