Well, this page is not ready yet, and will take some time to be written.<P>

For the time being, the Java game, I'm referring to can be found here:

I also write an implementation of it in JavaScript. It can be found here:

You should experience with it, and try to figure out a methodical way to
solve it. Afterwards, you can read <A HREF="../toggle.html">this report</A>
which I prepared for Ken Housley, who programmed the game applet. The report
describes an algorithm which we figured out to solve the game, and proves
why this algorithm is working.<P>

I frequently used many Linear Algebra terms there, so you may need to be familiar
with this field to fully understand it. When I prepare this page, I will
explain everything with more basic material, but for now, this will have
to do.
