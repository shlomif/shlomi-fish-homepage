<p>
Perl allows one to refer to the location of a certain variable in memory. An
expression that holds such a location is called a <b>reference</b>. Those that
are familiar with C's or Pascal's pointers may think of references as 
pointers. There are however, two fundamental differences:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
There is no reference arithmetics in perl. If for example, a reference points
to the fifth element of an array, then adding 1 to it will not refer you to the 
sixth element. In fact, adding or substracting integers from references is 
possible but quite meaningless.
</li>

<li>
A reference is guaranteed to remain the same even if an array or a string are
resized. In C, <tt>realloc</tt>ing an array yields a completely different 
pointer.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Perl distinguishes between an array or a hash and a reference of it. 
The reference of any array may be taken, and a reference to an array 
may always be converted to its elements, but there is still a difference 
in functionality.
</p>

<p>
The best way to change a variable in a different scope 
(such as inside a different function) is to pass its reference to the
function. The called function can then dereference the variable to access
or modify its value.
