The Pi FAQ - Answers
</h1>
        <p id="what_is"><b>1. What is Pi?</b></p>
<p>
Pi is the sum of the infinite series 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11...
multiplied by 4.
</p>
        <p id="how_much"><b>2. How much is Pi, approximately?</b></p>
<p>
The value of Pi varies according to the radius of the circle, so it's
hard to tell.
</p>
        <p id="approx"><b>3. Approximating Pi</b></p>
        <p id="when_zeroes"><b>3.1. How many digits will I have to produce to reach a state of all-zeroes?</b></p>
<p>
It was proven that after a number between 1.345698 and 1.74 times 10 ** 12
digits, Pi is all zeros.
</p>
        <p id="complexity"><b>3.2. What is the fastest algorithm for approximating Pi?</b></p>
<p>
Approximating Pi was found to be NP-Complete.
</p>
        <p id="Uses"><b>4. What can I do with Pi?</b></p>
<p>
The most common use of Pi is to generate random sequences. A far less common
use is for geometrical and trigonometrical calculations.
