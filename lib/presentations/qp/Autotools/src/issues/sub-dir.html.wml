<li>
To have a directory with its own separate <tt>configure</tt> script, first
put it in the <tt>SUBDIRS</tt> variable of Makefile.am
</li>

<li>
Then use the <tt>AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS</tt> macro in <tt>configure.in</tt> to
configure them as separate sub-directories.
</li>

<li>
If a sub-directory inherits from the same subdirectory, then they will
also be linked against all the shared libraries, which may not be
desirable.
