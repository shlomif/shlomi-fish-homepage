Freecell's Rules:
-----------------

* There are 8 stacks of cards, 4 freecells, and 4 foundations. The game
is played with one deck.

* At the beginning of play, the cards are dealt to the stacks (4*7+4*6).
The faces of all the cards are visible at the beginning of play.

* A freecell can hold one _single_ card.

* The foundations are built from ace to king and the object of the
game is to move all the cards to the foundations.

* A card can be placed on top of a card that is of the opposite colour,
and is higher in rank by 1, assuming that the latter is at the top of a
stack.

* An empty stack may be filled with any card.

* An atomic move consists of:
    - moving a card from a stack to a freecell.
    - moving a card from a freecell to a parent card on a stack.
    - moving a card from the top of a stack on top of a parent card on a
      different stack
    - moving a card from the top of a stack or from a freecell to the
      foundation.

    Strategies:
    -----------

    * A sequence of more than one card can be moved by moving the top cards to
      the freecells or to unoccupied stacks. The later is commonly called a
      "supermove"

    * Sometimes, it is useful to move cards to the freecells, so the card
      below them can serve as a basis for a sequence.

The Freecell Solver 0.2 Architecture:
-------------------------------------

* A DFS scan:

Solve-State(state, prev_states, ret)
    if (state == empty_state)
        Push(ret, state)
        return SOLVED
    for each move possible on state
        new_state <- state
        apply(new_state, move)
        if (new_state in prev_states)
            ; Do nothing
        else
            add new_state to prev_states
            if (Solve-State(new_state, prev_states, ret) == SOLVED)
                Push(ret, state)
                return SOLVED
    return UNSOLVED

Freecell-Solver(init_state)
    if (Solve-State(init_state, Null, ret) == SOLVED)
        print "State was solved"
        while (state <- Pop(ret))
            print state
    else
        print "I could not solve this board";


* Several tests to get to subsequent moves - give some examples:
    I called them "multi-move" to indicate they may include one or more
    moves or "supermoves". By coding them I tried to emulate the kind of
    moves a human player would try to do.

    Examples:
    ---------

    * Put top stacks cards in the foundations.
    * Put Freecell cards in the foundations.
    * Put non-top stack cards in the foundations. (by moving cards above them
    to freecells or vacant stacks).
    * Move stack cards to different stacks.
    * Move sequences of cards onto free stacks.
    * etc.

    I later improved some of these moves and added an extra one.

    Due to their multi-moves heuristic nature, it is possible that some boards
    are solvable, yet cannot be solved by FCS.

* Once the program finds a solution it outputs the intermediate boards to
    the screen.

* Each state was represented as a relatively large data structure containing
other data structures.
    - A card was { short, short}
    - A stack was { int, card[] },
    - A state was { stack[] }.

* The State collection was implemented as a sorted vector of whole state data
    structures.
    - It had a sort margin, so not every new element would require moving
        many states aside.
    - After several elements were collected the array and its sort margin
        were qsort()ed.

The State Collection Representation Improvements:
-------------------------------------------------

    B-search based merge to add the sort margin instead of qsort:
    -------------------------------------------------------------

    * The sort margin is kept outside the main array.

    * It is added to the main array by using a binary search-based merge.

        - The reason why it was preferred over a normal linear merge
          was because there are usually much more elements in the main
          array so a lot of time would be spent on comparisons.

    * The merge was done from end to start, so there was not any need in
      allocating an extra space.

    Pointers to structs instead of a vector of whole structs:
    ---------------------------------------------------------

    * I converted the vector to be a vector of pointer to structs, instead
      of vector of whole structs.

    * There was a great speed improvements, because only pointers were
      manipulated and not entire structs, whose movement in memory requires
      a lot of time.

    A balanced binary tree:
    -----------------------

    * I don't really know how to program my own balanced binary tree
      implementation, but I found some on the Net:

      1. libavl - contains implementations of AVL and Red-Black trees.
      2. libredblack - contains an implementation of a Red-Black tree.
      3. glib - contains an implementation of a balanced binary tree.

      There are others, but I decided to stick to those three.

    * By using a balanced binary tree I managed to increase the brute speed
      by %33. (and the net speed times 2 or so).

    A Hash Table:
    -------------

        Description: What is a Hash Table?
        ----------------------------------

        * A hash table is a vector of linked lists. Each linked list contains
          a set of keys (or key-value pairs).

        * The index of the list in which the key is placed is determined by
          a hash function. Usually, the hash function generates an integer
          in a very large range, and the index is its modulo with the number
          of elements in the hash table.

            Rehashing:
            ----------

            Sometimes, when a hash becomes two crowded, the number of elements
            in it is increased and all of its existing elements are placed in
            their new place.


    * I first tried using glib's hash implementation with a 4-byte wide XOR as
      the hash function. This generated very awful results.

    * Then I tried using the MD5 hash function, and got excellent results
      similar to what I encountered when using a balanced binary tree.

    * I coded my own stripped-down hash implementation in my attempt to figure
      out what went wrong with using a hash. It turned out to be a bit faster
      than glib's hash.

        Hash Optimizations:
        -------------------

        * Storing the hash values along with the keys. That way, the hash
          values can be first compared before comparing the entire keys.

        * Moving elements that were hit to the start of their chains.

        * When re-hashing, using the same malloc'ed elements, only re-linking
          them to their new siblings.

The State Representation:
-------------------------

    Reducing the Data Type Width:
    -----------------------------

    * At first FCS represented cards as a struct of two shorts where one was
      the rank and the other the suit.

    * Having seen that it consumed quite a lot of memory, I decided to try to
      reduce the size. I made a card as a char whose first 4 bits were the
      rank and the two more upper bits the rank.

    * Surprisingly, this made the game even faster.

    * I consulted a mailing list of mine with this anomaly and reached the
      conclusion that it happened because there were fewer cache misses
      this way.

    Pointers to stacks instead of a vector of stacks:
    -------------------------------------------------

    * I later encountered two variants of Freecell (dubbed Der Katzenschwanz
      and Die Schlange) whose stacks could be extremely long (roughly as
      long as the number of cards in two decks).

    * This made representing the states as a direct vector of constant-sized
      stacks very wasteful.

    * What I did was store pointers for the stacks in each state, and store
      the stacks in their separate cache.

    * If two states had an identical stack, this stack would be stored in
      memory only once.

    * With this technique, I managed to scale the number of states on a 48 MB
      + 1 GB swap machine to 1,000,000 and more.

    Remembering the Original Stack and Freecell Locations:
    ------------------------------------------------------

    * To avoid the possibility of having two states, which differ only in
      the order of their stacks or freecells, FCS 0.2 sorted the stacks in
      a canonical order, after every multi-move.

    * It displayed them this way, too, making the solution harder to follow.

    * In order to solve this problem, I wanted to keep the original order
      somehow.

    * If I sticked to the original order and sorted the stacks before every
      comparison, it would have costed dearly, because every insert requires
      more than one comparison.

    * The solution: "Indexes out of Bounds of Main Data Structure"<tm> -
      anti-patent pending technology.

    * The original indexes of the stacks and freecells are kept outside the
      main data structure:

      struct state
      {
            /* ... */
      };

      struct state_with_locations
      {
            struct state s;
            int fc_locs[4];
            int stack_locs[8];
      };

    * A comparison is made only on the first sizeof(struct state) bytes.

Scans:
------

* The original Hard-DFS scan.

* A*

* Soft-DFS rev. 1.

* Soft-DFS rev. 2.

* The BFS optimization scan.

Move Stacks:
------------

* In the beginning, the user had to deduce what had happened between two
subsequent states.

* That was:
    A. Not comfortable.
    B. Even harder for a Freecell implementation to do on its own.

* I created the concept of move stacks, which each test loaded with the moves
that were it performed.

* Those stacks were later collected into one stack, to get the total move
stack from the initial board to the final solution.
