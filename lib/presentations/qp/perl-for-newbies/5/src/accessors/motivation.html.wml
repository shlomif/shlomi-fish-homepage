<p>
So why should we use accessors instead of doing a direct 
<tt>$person-&gt;{'age'}</tt> access to the object's property? There
are several reasons for that:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Writing the property names directly each time is prone to mis-spellings
and errors, because they are strings. On the other hand, the existence of
a particular name of methods are validated at run-time and will throw an
exception if they are not present.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
If a property needs to be converted from a first-order property to a
calculated value, then one can still use the existing method based interface
to access it, just by changing the implementation of the methods. On the
other, this is much more difficult to change with a direct-field access.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The external interface provided by methods is cleaner and easier to
maintain compatibility with, than a direct class access.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
There may be other reasons, like better concurrency, persistence, etc.
</p>
</li>

</ol>
