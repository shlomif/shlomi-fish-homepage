<para>
This essay aims to present a summary of a snapshot as of 2013 of my personal
philosophy and ideology, titled
<link xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/#rindolfism">“Rindolfism”</link>,
which is dynamic and subject to change.

<para>
I am really tired of having truly intellectual people like me “speak in
riddles” and be somewhat dishonest, so I'd like to put all the cards I have now
on the table. There will likely be more into the future, and moreover, honesty
is a process and a person should strive to become more honest as time goes by.
