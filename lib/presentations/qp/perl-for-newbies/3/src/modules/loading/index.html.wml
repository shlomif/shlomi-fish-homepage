#include 'template.wml'

<p>
In order to have access to a module from within your script (or from
within another module) you can use the <code>use</code> directive followed
by the name of the module as it is deduced from its path. Here's
an example: assume that the file "MyModule.pm" is this:
</p>

<quadpres_code_file filename="src/modules/loading/MyModule.pm" />

<p>
And this is your script:
</p>

<quadpres_code_file filename="src/modules/loading/test.pl" />

<p>
That way, the program will print "Hello, World!" on the screen.
</p>
