<title>חלק 1: יום שני</title>

האפיפיור מת ביום ראשון.

לרייצ'ל סאות'רן זה לא הפריע. היא אומנם הייתה קתולית למחצה, אך אילו
שאלת אותה אם אלוהים אכן קיים היא הייתה עונה: „גם אילו אלהים היה קיים,
הוא לא היה מצפה שנאמין בו“. ומובן שלא הייתה קונה חלוקה מלאכותית שלו
לשלושה חלקים, גם אילו האמינה שהוא קיים. וכך היא הלכה בדרכה לעבודה
שלה ביום שני שנראה לה כמה שעתיד להתחיל שבוע טיפוסי לחלוטין
בחייה של רווקה אמריקאית בשנות ה-20 לחייה.

היא לא הרבתה להודות בכך, אבל יום שני היה היום החביב עליה ביותר בשבוע
(היא הכי שנאה את יום רביעי). לא שהיא לא אהבה את סוף השבוע. אבל היא אהבה
את עבודתה מספיק כדי להעריך את ההתחלה של ימי החול בהם עבדה. אותו הדבר היה
גם כשלמדה, אלא שעכשיו אהבה אותו יותר, משום שהיא העדיפה עבודה על פני
לימודים.

גרפיקאית כמו רייצ'ל איננה יכולה להרשות לעצמה לאבד רגע מאותו יום יקר
הידוע גם כיום שני. על מנת לתמרן בין ארבע תוכנות שונות (Adobe
Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Corel-Draw  ו – GIMP), על מה שהיה
כדבריה „אותו תרוץ למערכת הפעלה הידוע גם כ-Windows 98“ דרושה מידה רבה של
סבלנות וסובלנות. לרייצ'ל היה חסך די רציני בשתי תכונות אלה, אבל מה לעשות
שהיא בעצם אהבה גרפיקה. אבל בביתה היה לה שלל חולצות עם אותו ספק פנגווין
ספק ברווז, כדי להביע את תקוותה לימים טובים יותר.

בכל מקרה, באותו יום רייצ'ל הספיקה לתפוס אוטובוס מוקדם והגיעה לעבודתה
מעט לפני הזמן, ברבע לתשע. היא הניחה את תרמילה, והדליקה את המחשב. היא
בדקה דואר אלקטרוני, עברה על רשימת המטלות שלה, ארגנה את סדר היום ואז
החליטה לקחת תה צמחים כדי להתחיל את היום על רגל ימין. לכן, ניגשה לפינת
הקפה. מעט מעמיתיה היו בפינת הקפה כשהם דנים במה שנשמע כאותו מאורע שקרה
אתמול.

„טוב, לדעתי, לחשמן אברוס יש את הסיכויים הכי טובים להיבחר לאפיפיור
חדש.“ אמר אדם גרינסקי, שהיה גרפיקאי נוסף שעבד בחברה.

„אני ממש לא בטוחה בזה.“ אמרה אווה הלוורת, שהייתה מנהלת חשבונות. „גם
כשהאפיפיור המנוח נבחר, הרוב חשבו שסיכוייו להיבחר היו קלושים.“

רייצ'ל ניגשה כדי להכין לעצמה תה שקדים, והדליקה את הקומקום החשמלי, על
אף שהייתה כמעט בטוחה שיש בו מספיק מים חמים.

„אה, רייצ'ל, “ פנה אליה אדם, „מי לדעתך יבחר לאפיפיור הבא?“

„לדעתי, האפיפיור הבא הוא משתנה אקראי פואסוני עם תוחלת של 0.7, כאשר 0
הינו החשמן אברוס, אחד הוא ... “

„האם אי-פעם תפסיקי להדגיש את העובדה שאת בוגרת מדעי המחשב?“

„הזמן בו אפסיק זאת הוא משתנה אקראי מעריכי עם תוחלת של 5 שנים.“

„מה זאת אומרת?“

„זאת אומרת שלא משנה כמה זמן עובר, הסיכוי שאפסיק בפרק זמן בעל אורך נתון
נשאר קבוע.“

„זה לא נשמע טוב.“

„זה לא.“ אמרה רייצ'ל כשהיא מרימה את כוס התה שלה. „זה מאוד לא.“

רייצ'ל ניגשה למחשב שלה, והתחילה לעבוד עליו. הייתה לה תמונה שהייתה
צריכה לגמור ב-Illustrator אבל באותו זמן גם קראה את ה-E-mail שלה.

לא עבר זמן רב, וניגש אליה אלקס רודמן, נער צעיר, שהחליט לעבוד לפני
שהתחיל ללמוד באוניברסיטה („אם בכלל“, כדבריו). הוא היה אחד מאנשי ה-System
ורייצ'ל מצאה את זה מאוד נוח להטיל עליו מטלות מזדמנות.

„גמרתי לכתוב את התסריט שביקשת ממני.“

„אלקס, “ השיבה רייצ'ל כשהיא אינה מזיזה את עיניה מהמחשב, „אתה מתוק
לאללה.“

„אילו רק הדייטים שלי היו אומרות דבר כזה...“

„האמן לי שהן עוד יגידו לך את זה. בכל מקרה, מה האורך שלו.“

„אני לא יודע.100, 200 שורות.“

„ובכמה grepים, sortים, mapים ו-joinים השתמשת?“

„יותר מידי.“

„טוב, שיהיה. תודה בכל מקרה. על כל פנים, אני שנאתי ליספ כשלמדתי
באוניברסיטה ולדעתי פרל ירשה אחדים מהמאפיינים הפחות חביבים שלה.“

„אם כך לא תשמחי לשמוח שהשתמשתי ב-eval כדי להדר קצת קוד בזמן
ריצה.“

„אוי לא!“ אמרה רייצ'ל כשהיא שמה את כפות ידיה על הפנים שלה, „מדוע היית
צריך לעשות דבר כזה? נראה לי שהיעוד שלך הוא להיות מתכנת LISP או
Scheme.“

„את רוצה שאני אכתוב את התוכנית בצורה שיותר דומה ל-C?“

„לא, לא חשוב. 'אם זה עובד - אל תיגע בזה'. אין לי מושג מדוע לארי וו'אל
החליט שאפשר יהיה לכתוב ב-Perl קוד שדומה לכל שפה אחרת. אני אישית הייתי
שמחה אם זה היה פשוט C עם מחרוזות באורך בלתי מוגבל שיכולות להכיל כל
תו…“

„ביטויים רגולרים“ אמר אלקס.

„כן, מערכים באורך בלתי מוגבל, וכל הדברים השפויים האחרים.“

„אני דווקא חושב שזה מגניב שאפשר לעשות למבדה קלקולוס ב-Perl.“

„לידיעתך, אפשר לעשות את זה גם ב-C.“

„באמת, איך?“

„משהו עם מחסנית - אני לא זוכרת את הפרטים המדויקים כי מעולם לא התעמקתי
בזה, וזה היה הדבר הראשון ששכחתי אחרי שלקחתי את הקורס. מה שכן, ראיתי
מישהו שהשתמש בזה ב-C.“

„באמת, איך היה הקוד שלו?“

„הלמבדה קלקולוס היה יפהפה.“

„ואיך היה הקוד בתור תוכנית ב-C?“

„לגמרי לא מובן. בסוף שכנעתי אותו להמיר את זה לקוד סטנדרטי של C. טוב,
אני חושבת שכדאי שאתחיל לעבוד קצת, אני כבר אסתדר עם הסקריפט
שכתבת.“

„בסדר, להתראות!“

„ביי,“ אמרה רייצ'ל וחזרה לעבודתה.

רייצ'ל הספיקה לגמור את התמונה עד לשעה 11:00, ומאז עד ארוחת צהריים
הסתובבה בנסיון לקבל עבורה משוב מחבריה לעבודה. זה לא היה פשוט, משום שלכל
אחד היתה דעה שצריך לשנות שם משהו שונה לחלוטין. רייצ'ל קראה למיני-כינוס
כדי לדון במה צריך לעשות על מנת לתקן אותה וכתוצאה מכך נדמה היה שחוסר
ההסכמה רק גבר. אבל אז הגיע הזמן לארוחת צהריים.

לפעמים רייצ'ל הצטערה על כך שלא עבדה בתור מתכנתת, ששם המתכנתים העמיתים
שמחו שבכלל יש קוד שמתקמפל ועובד. „טוב,“ היא אמרה לעצמה, „גם אם אמאס לי
לחלוטין מגרפיקה, תמיד אוכל למצוא עבודה כמתכנתת. לפחות כרגע.“ היא נהגה
להסתכל במודעות הדרושים בעיתון ורובן לא היו בשביל גרפיקאים.

באותו יום, החליטה רייצ'ל לצאת לארוחת צהריים עם אלקס, בטי פירס, שגם היא
הייתה גרפיקאית, וכן אנג'לה קרונמן שהייתה מזכירה בחברה. הם החליטו ללכת
למסעדה סינית קרובה, שלא רק שהייתה זולה, אלא הייתה גם די טובה.

רייצ'ל התעקשה לאכול עם מקלות סיניים וכך היא התרשמה שנהג גם אלקס. שתי הנשים
האחרות נהגו לאכול עם סכין ומזלג.

„יצא לי להסתכל על התסריט שלך.“ אמרה רייצ'ל לאלקס כשחיכו לבוא המנה
העיקרית.

„ו-?“ אמר אלקס בציפיה.

„ראיתי תוכניות יותר מובנות ב-Scheme שהתשמשו בכל הדברים הגרועים שאתה
השתמשת: eval, מיפויים, פילטרים, אקומולטורים וכו.“

„טוב. פרל לא אמורה להיות יותר מובנת מ-Scheme.“

„נכון. אבל כשאני כותבת משהו בפרל או בשפת תכנות אחרת, אני משתדלת לחשוב
על האנשים שקוראים אותה. למשל, אני לעיתים רחוקות מאוד קוראת למשתנים שלי
a, b, i  או j, וגם אם אלה משתנים בני אות אחת או שתיים, אני מוסיפה הערה
שאומרת מה משמעות האות. מזל שאצלך, ידעתי מה הסקריפט צריך לעשות, אחרת ממש
לא הייתי מבינה אותו.“

„אני לא מניח שהרגלים כאלה רוכשים כשלומדים מדעי-המחשב באוניברסיטה?“ אמר
אלקס.

„לצערי, מטרת לימודי המחשבים באוניברסיטה היא ללמד אותך דברים שונים
לחלוטין. כמו איך לממש עץ בינרי מאוזן, או איך לכתוב תוכנית שמחשבת מכפלה
של שני מספרים בלמבדה קלקולוס, או איך לכתוב מהדר. או עוד אלף דברים
אחרים שב-90% מהמקרים לא תצטרך להשתמש בהם. וב-10% מהמקרים הנותרים, אני
בטוחה שמהנדסי חשמל, או פיסיקאים או אנשים ללא כל הכשרה אקדמית היו יכולים
להצליח בכך לא פחות.“

„אבל, לכתוב תוכנית בצורה קריאה, מובנית, ברת-הרחבה, וחוצת-מערכות
לא.“, אמר אלקס.

„אמת ויציב. אני לא יודעת אם יותר הזקתי או הועלתי לשותף שלי ב'מבוא
למדעי המחשב', שהיה קורס המבוא לתכנות אצלנו בפן סטייט. [Penn. State] כל
רעיון שהיה לו איך לכתוב תוכנית היה עובד, אבל היה פשוט לא קביל, מנקודת
מבט של מתכנת מנוסה. אין לי מושג איך אנשים ניגשים לאוניברסיטה לפני שהם
התנסו בתכנות בעצמם.“

„רייצ'ל יקירתי, “ אמרה בטי, „את סיפרת לנו די והותר על איך את ואחיך
הייתם האקרים רציניים בזמנכם.“

„אם את קוראת למי שתכנת בבייסיק וב-C++ של 16 סיביות – ללא בסיס-נתונים
SQLי, ללא מערכת הפעלה עם ריבוי משימות תקין, ללא ידע גדול כל-כך במתמטיקה,
ועם מערכים ו-structים בתור מבני-הנתונים היחידים – האקר, אז כן – שיחקנו
אותה בגדול. וזה היה עוד בסדר לעומת מה שביל גייטס עשה בצעירותו. אבל בימי
הלינוקס הטרופים האלה, ההתנסויות שלי ושל אח שלי בצעירותנו הן כבר מזמן
depreciated, כמו שאומרים.“

„וזאת הסיבה שנהיית גרפיקאית?“

„לא, אני פשוט אוהבת גרפיקה ולצייר באופן כללי, כך שמצאתי את העבודה הזאת
כדי לדחות את הבלתי-נמנע.“

„שזאת עבודה בעמק הסיליקון?“

„משהו כזה. “ אמרה רייצ'ל וניגשה לאכול את האוכל שלה שהגיע סוף כל
סוף.

אחרי ארוחת צהריים, רייצ'ל שיחקה משחק אחד של פריסל, ועבדה על משהו חדש,
הפעם ב-GIMP. אחרי שכולם חזרו מארוחת צהריים, היא קראה שוב פעם
למיני-כינוס והפעם רשמה את ההערות של כולם, וחילקה אותם למה בדיוק הם לא
אהבו בשרטוט. אז היא הביא אותם לדון בכל נושא בנפרד ובסוף השתררה הסכמה
רחבה על מה בדיוק צריך לשנות בו. היא ניגשה לעשות זאת.

כשרייצ'ל גמרה לעבוד על השינויים הייתה זו בערך השעה שבה נהגה ללכת
הבייתה, והיא החליטה לדחות את הגשת המוצר הסופי לממונה עליה, למחרת. היא
כיבתה את המחשב שלה, ויצאה מהקומפלקס של החברה בה עבדה.

כאשר היא הגיעה לבניין בו גרה, ועלתה במדרגות לדירה שלה היא ראתה את השכן
שלה, קליף, מדבר עם גבר אחר. היא די חיבבה את קליף ולכן עצרה כדי לראות במה
מדובר.

„רייצ'ל“ קרא קליף כשהתקרבה לשם. „תכירי בבקשה את גרג, חבר שלי
מהאוניברסיטה, שלפני זמן לא רב עבר למילווקי בשביל עבודה חדשה.“

„נעים מאוד להכיר אותך, גרג. “ אמרה רייצ'ל והסתכלה בו. לגרג היה שיער
שחור חלק, עיניים חומות, ופנים מאוד מעניינות. די חתיך, לפחות לטעמה של
רייצ'ל.

„לי קוראים רייצ'ל סאותרן, אני גרה למעלה, בדירה 6 ב'. אני למדתי מחשבים באוניברסיטה אבל אני עובדת כגרפיקאית.“

„נעים מאוד להכיר אותך מיס סאות'רן.“

„רייצ'ל. קרא לי רייצ'ל. “ אמרה רייצ'ל והוסיפה, „במה אתה עוסק,
גרג?“

„אני מהנדס אזרחי. אין יותר מידי כמוני, אבל כמוני בדיוק יש רק
אחד.“

„ובמה אתה הולך לעבוד?“

„אני הולך לעבוד בעירייה של מילווקי כמהנדס תשתיות מים.“

„נשמע מעניין.“ אמרה רייצ'ל על אף שזה לא נשמע לה כל-כך מעניין והוסיפה
„שמע, אם אתה לא עסוק מחר בערב, מה דעתך לצאת ביחד איתי לפגישה?“ רייצ'ל לא
האמינה שהיא הצליחה להגיד את זה במשפט אחד.

גרג חשב על זה לרגע, „בסדר גמור. את הכתובת אני יודע משום שהגעתי לכאן
בכוחות עצמי. אז מחר.“

„או. בי. קיי. בי. להתראות לשניכם.“ אמרה רייצ'ל, אך כשניגשה ללכת הבחינה
שבתוך כיסו של גרג ביצבץ משהו שנראה כמו Palm Pilot.

„זה פאלם במקרה? “ אמרה כשהיא מצביעה על כיסו.

„כן, מדוע?“

„אתה לא מתכוון לרשום שם את הפגישה במקרה?“

„לא, אני לא שוכח דברים כאלה.“

„שיהיה. “ אמרה רייצ'ל, „ להתראות קליף ואני אראה אותך מחר גרג.“

והיא עלתה במדרגות.

באותו הערב רייצ'ל עלתה על האינטרנט ודיברה ב-IRC. היא פגשה שם את אחת
מהמכרות האלקטרוניות שלה, שהזדהתה בכינוי „Cruella“. הן נקלעו לשיחה על
המאורעות שקרו לרייצ'ל באותו יום.

„ואז כשחזרתי הבייתה פגשתי בחור.“ אמרה רייצ'ל בצ'אט.

„באמת? ומה קרה?“

„הזמנתי אותו לצאת איתי מחר.“

“You rule, girlfriend!‎” , „בכל מקרה, מה הוא עושה?“

„מהנדס תשתיות מים לפי מה שהבנתי.“

„משע ... עמם. ואיך הוא נראה?“

„די טוב, לדעתי.“

„אכלה.“

„בכל מקרה, דבר אחד מטריד אותי – היה לו פאלם פיילוט אבל הוא לא השתמש בו
כדי לרשום את מועד הפגישה.“

„ומה רע בזה?“

„לא יודעת, אולי הוא ישכח. או שהוא כבר ייעשה יותר מידי תלוי במכשיר הזה
עד אז.“

„Get a life!“

„זה בדיוק מה שאני עושה. :-|==&gt;“

<title>חלק 2: יום שלישי</title>

כאשר רייצ'ל נסעה באוטובוס באותו בוקר של יום שלישי, היא נקלעה לשיחה
מעניינת עם אדם שחור שלבש אומנם בגדים פשוטים אך לפחות לפי מה שאמר, היה די
עשיר.

„ואם-כך מדוע אתה עדיין נוסע באוטובוס?“ אמרה לו רייצ'ל.

„דבר ראשון, אני עדיין מרגיש קצת נאמנות לאוטובוסים בהם נסעתי בתקופה בה
הייתי עני. שנית, ויותר חשוב, אני שונא את הקונספט שתהיה לי מכונית פרטית.
זה פשוט יותר מידי טרחה.“

„אמן.“ הוסיפה רייצ'ל, שלא התכוונה לרכוש מכונית פרטית לפחות עד שיהיו לה
ילדים. „בכל מקרה, “ הוסיפה „אתה חיית בשכונות העוני במשך צעירותך ועבדת
בתחילת דרכך בעבודות קשות עם שכר מאוד נמוך – הנה אתה עכשיו מיליונר ומעסיק
אנשים אחרים. איך עשית את זה?“

הכושי, שביקש שרייצ'ל תקרא לו מר ניימן אמר „המפנה בחיים שלי הגיע
כשהבנתי מה התשובה לשאלה.“

„איזו שאלה?“

„השאלה.“

„שאלת החיים, היקום והכל?“

„כן.“

„ומה השאלה הזו?“

„מי האיש החזק [=powerful] ביותר בעולם?“

„מי האיש החזק ביותר בעולם?“

„כן.“

„לא יודעת. ביל גייטס, נשיא ארה"ב, מי שיהיה האפיפיור החדש. לינוס
טורבלדס.“

„לא, לא, לא ולא.“

„אז מי?“

„את זה תצטרכי לגלות בעצמך. הנה התחנה שלי. להתראות מיס סאות'רן.“

„ביי“ השיבה לו רייצ'ל ואז מר ניימן ירד מהאוטובוס. רייצ'ל נשארה יושבת
בכסאה לזמן מה מהרהרת ואז הגיעה התחנה שלה. היא ירדה מהאוטובוס.

רייצ'ל הלכה ברחוב ולפתח שמה לב שהיא הולכת מאחורי איש שעישן. כל העשן
הגיע אליה מה שהפריע לה מאוד. לכן, היא התחילה לרוץ, עקפה את האיש וחזרה
למהירות הליכה רגילה. „מזל שאני לעולם לא נועלת עקבים.“ חשבה לעצמה.

היא הגיעה למקום עבודתה ושוב פעם הניחה את התרמיל שלה ליד המחשב שלה,
ונכנסה למחשב. היא שלחה את מה שהכינה יום קודם לכן לממונה אליה בדואר
אלקטרוני, ואז ניגשה לעבר השולחן שלו.

„לא רע...“ הוא אמר לה, „סתם, זה מאוד נחמד.“ ואז הוא נתן לה מספר מטלות
חדשות לעשות. רייצ'ל חזרה לשולחנה.

רייצ'ל אי פעם תהתה אם אי פעם הדרישה ליצירות גרפיקה תגיע לרוויה, וכבר
לא יצטרכו גרפיקה חדשה. או שמא המטלות שלה היו כמו ראשי הידרה שכל פעם
שנכרת אחד, צומחים שלושה במקומו. ברגע שלקוח היה מרוצה מלוגו מסוים, הוא ביקש
לשלב גרסאות שלו בנייר מכתבים, באתר הבית של החברה שלו, בכרטיסי הביקור של
החברה, בעלונים של המוצרים, וכן הלאה. זה דרש עוד ועוד עבודה.

רייצ'ל שמחה שתמיד יהיה לה מה לעשות כך, אבל תמיד רצתה מרווח מחייה מרגע
שסיימה משימה עד שהתחילה משימה חדשה. זה תמיד היה קשה להתחיל דבר חדש אחרי
שמשהו אחר סוים, משום שהרגשת ההצלחה נהגה לשכר אותה.

מלבד זאת יום העבודה היה מחוסר מאורעות. ארוחת הצהריים עברה ללא הרבה
שיחה, ורייצ'ל הרגישה שהיא הספיקה די הרבה באותו יום. היא עזבה את העבודה
בשעה הרגילה, כשהמטלות שהייתה צריכה לבצע מבוצעות פחות או יותר בחציין. היא
לקחה את האוטובוס לביתה, והגיעה מספיק מוקדם כדי להספיק לרכב על אופניים,
מה שאהבה מאוד וציפתה לו בקוצר רוח.

במדרגות פגשה רייצ'ל את קליף עוד-פעם כשהוא מלווה בגבר שנראה כבן 30 או
40, בעל שפם וזקן, שנראה לה מוכר מאיזה שהוא מקום.

„הי.“ אמרה רייצ'ל.

„הי, “ אמר קליף, „הכירי את רודולף אייזנברג. אם השם לא מוכר לך אז תדעי
שהוא מעצב אופנה גרמני, ואל תגידי לו את זה בפנים אבל הוא גם בעל שם
עולמי.“

„אה, כן, שמעתי את השם מתישהו.“

„למעשה, אני ארכיטקט בהכשרתי, אבל גיליתי לאחר זמן מה שהשגעון שלי התאים
יותר לעיצוב אופנה. זה קרה כשעזרתי לחבר שלי, שהוא מעצב אופנה Full-Time
לעצב את הקולקציה שלו, והוא התעקש לשים את השם שלי לידו. והעובדה היא שיש
מספיק אנשים שהם בעל טעם כזה שהם קונים את הבגדים שלי, מה שמאשש את ההנחה
שלי שאני אינני האדם הבלתי-שפוי היחיד ביקום.“

„אמן.“ אמרה רייצ'ל.

„חוץ מזה, “ הוסיף קליף, „הוא גם גאון ומסרב להודות בכך.“

„אני לא גאון ואני לא מסרב להודות בכך.“

„בכל מקרה,“ אמרה רייצ'ל „מה אתה עושה דווקא בבניין הזה?“

„מר קרטר כאן עוזר לי להעלות משהו שהוא הצגה שלמעשה תציג את הבגדים שלי.
מעין הצגת-אופנה.“

„אחלה רעיון!“ אמרה רייצ'ל. היא תמיד חשבה שתצוגות אופנה היו משעממות
תקנה.

„אם זה רעיון טוב, זאת כבר שאלה אחרת. אבל זה ללא ספק רעיון משוגע ולא
שגרתי עד כדי-כך שאני בטוח שהגיתי אותו בעצמי. האמיני או לו, אבל זה בא לי
בחלום שבו במקום ללכת על המסלול הדוגמניות והדוגמנים התחילו לדבר אחד עם
השני ולספר חוויות שקרו להם בעבר הקרוב שלהם. אני התעוררתי מהחלום ואחרי
קצת עיבוד מחשבתי, חשבתי על הרעיון שסיפרתי לך.

גם מבחינה לוגיסטית זה עשוי לעבוד מצויין משום שחלק גדול מהדוגמנים
והדוגמניות בימנו רוצים להיות שחקנים. או להפך. כך, שגם שחקנים שרוצים
להיות דוגמנים, או דוגמנים שרוצים להיות שחקנים, או מי שרוצה להיות או זה
או זה, או את שניהם יוכל למצוא מקום בהצגה כזאת. מושלם.“

„כן, זה בהחלט עשוי לעבוד. היכן אתם מתכוונים שההצגה תתקיים?“

„ממש כאן!“, השיב אייזנברג. „זאת אומרת, בגן הקרוב לכאן. אני רוצה לעשות
זאת באחד הפרברים כדי לשוות לזה פרופיל נמוך יחסית. פשוט זאת מעין חזרה (אם
כי מול קהל) של ההצגה לפני הופעה עם פרופיל יותר גבוה בניו-יורק.“

„מעניין... “ אמרה רייצ'ל. „אז מתי היא תתקיים?“

„במוצאי יום ראשון.“

„המממ...  טוב, אני חושבת שאצא לרכב על אופניים, ויש לי גם פגישה יותר
מאוחר, עם חבר של קליף כאן.“

„אה, לא שכחת!“ אמר קליף.

„לא, “ אמרה רייצ'ל והסמיקה.

אחרי שרייצ'ל רכבה על אופניים באותו יום, היא ניגשה להתכונן לפגישה.
אנשים בסביבתה של רייצ'ל (גברים ונשים כאחד) תיארו את רייצ'ל כ„חמודה“,
„חיננית“, „מקסימה“ וכו: „את נראית נפלא!“, „את נראית מהמם!“, וכו. רייצ'ל
לא האמינה שהיא יפה, ולמרות זאת בילתה זמן רב ברחצה, הצתחצחות, התאפרות,
התלבשות והתאבזרות כדי לשוות לעצמה מראה שהיה לדעתה יותר נסבל.

כאשר היא הייתה בשלבים האחרונים של ההתארגנות נשמע צלצול בדלת. זה היה
גרג, כשהוא מוכן ומאורגן לפגישה. „ואאו!“ הוא אמר, „את נראית ממש טוב“.
רייצ'ל נאנחה בליבה. „תודה, גם אתה נראה ממש נחמד“ וחשבה שהוא עשוי לחשוב
אותו הדבר. „בבקשה, היכנס.“ אמרה וגרג נכנס לדירה.

גרג שם לב שרייצ'ל נועלת נעלי ספורט. „את לא מתכוונת ללבוש עקבים?“
שאל.

„אני לעולם לא לובשת עקבים. הן ממש מקשות על ריצה, הליכה, רכיבה אופניים,
התעמלות ועוד כל מיני פעילויות שאני עשויה לרצות פעם לעשות. אלהים ברא את
הנשים נמוכות יותר מגברים, והגיע הזמן שנשים ישלימו עם העובדה הזאת. חוץ
מזה זה חלק מפילוסופיה גורפת שלי.“

„איזו פילוסופיה?“

„אני לא לובשת עקבים, לא מפחדת מחרקים ועכברים, אין לי חורים באוזניים,
ואני האקרית (לא קראקרית בבקשה!) מדופלמת של מחשבים. אין לי חוש טכני טוב,
אבל אני מזמינה טכנאים לתקן דברים בבית מהכסף שאני מרוויחה. תחי העצמאות
הנשית!!“

„מדהים.“ אמר גרג ומחה כפיים, „דרך אגב, אני יודע לתקן דברים מכניים
וכיוצא באלה – אבל אני כמעט ולא מבין במחשבים.“

„אז יכול להיות שנהיה זוג מושלם. “ אמרה רייצל, „בכל מקרה, עדיין לא
גמרתי להתכונן, אז בינתיים אתה יכול לשבת על הספה ולהרגיש בבית“.

„תודה. אני אחכה. אני מבין שאת עדיין מאמינה שאשה צריכה
להתייפות.“

„כן. אני לא מוצאת תכונה נשית זאת אי-רציונלית כלל.“ והיא חזרה
לאמבטיה.

זמן מה לאחר מכן, כשרייצ'ל עמדה בדיוק לשים עגילים על אוזניה נשמע צלצול
בדלת. „עוד מישהו?“ חשבה רייצ'ל וצעקה „אני אענה.“.

רייצ'ל ניגשה לפתוח את הדלת כשהיא עדיין שמה את אחד מהקליפסים של העגילים
על אוזנה. כאשר פתחה את הדלת ראתה את קייטי אדאמס, שהייתה חברתה הטובה
ביותר, לפחות מאז שרייצ'ל עברה למילווקי. קייטי לבשה חיוך רחב על שפתיה,
שאצל רייצ'ל עשה רושם כמלאכותי מעט.

„היי“, אמרה קייטי, „את נראית נפלא.“

„תודה. “ אמרה רייצ'ל , „גם את.“ על אף שקייטי הייתה לבושה בסגנון פשוט
יותר.

„שמעי, “, היא המשיכה, „את קצת...“.

„כן, מן הסתם, יש לך פגישה היום, הייתי צריכה לדעת... זה לא שכל יום את
נראית כל-כך טוב...“.

„מן הסתם, “ אמרה רייצ'ל – היא העמידה פנים שמה שקייטי אמרה לא העליב
אותה.

„פשוט לי יש איזו בעייה קטנה, ורציתי להיעזר בך.“

„אוקיי, מה בדיוק הבעייה?“

„זה בקשר לחבר שלי...“

„מי? רוג'ר?“ רייצ'ל התקשתה לזכור את שמות החברים של קייטי, אבל היא
הייתה עם רוג'ר כבר זמן רב, והיא דיברה עליו ללא הפסקה.

„כן, רוג'ר.“ אמרה קייטי והרחיבה את החיוך שלה.

„מה בקשר אליו?“ שאלה רייצ'ל. היא הרגישה עצבנות, אבל קיוותה שהיא לא
החצינה עובדה זאת.

„אממ... כן רוג'ר... זה פשוט שהוא...“

„כן?“ אמרה רייצ'ל.

„הוא נטש אותי!“ קראה קייטי והתחילה לבכות.

רייצ'ל לא החשיבה את עצמה כאדם שפוי. אבל, לדעתה אילו כל האנשים היו כמו
החברה שלה, היא הייתה נחשבת לאדם השפוי ביותר בעולם. כך שהתנהגות כזו הייתה
מוכרת לה. על כל פנים, היא קרבה את חברתה אליה כדי שזו תוכל להשעין את ראשה
על כתפה של רייצ'ל.

„זה היה כל-כך פתאומי... ולא צפוי... אני חשבתי שהכל הולך אצלנו בסדר. את
יודעת מתי קיימנו יחסי-מין בפעם האחרונה?“

„לא, “ אמרה רייצ'ל, „וזה יותר ממה שאני צריכה לדעת. בכל מקרה, זה בסדר -
דברים כאלה קורים לפעמים.“

„זה קל בשבילך להגיד, אותך לא נטש אף פעם חבר שלך.“

„ממש לא.“ אמרה רייצ'ל בליבה.

„מה קורה כאן?“, נשמע קולו של גרג מכיוון הטרקלין, כשהוא בא
לכיוון הדלת.

„שום דבר,“ אמרה רייצ'ל, „פשוט קייטי כאן…“ ואז היא שמה לב שקייטי
הביטה לכיוון גרג והבעת פניה השתנתה בהדרגה.

„כן, פשוט נפרדתי מחבר שלי היום“, אמרה קייטי בעליזות כשהיא עוקפת את
רייצ'ל כדי ללחוץ את ידו של גרג, „זה שום דבר באמת, אני מרגישה בסדר“.
רייצ'ל אמרה בליבה „מה, לעזאזל?“, ואז הביטה בקייטי אומרת „אה, הרשה לי
להציג את עצמי - קייטי אדמס. קרא לי קייטי.“ ולחצה את ידו של גרג בשתי
ידיה.

„גרג.“ אמר גרג בהבעת פנים שרייצ'ל פירשה כבין נבוך למשועשע. „אני מצטער
לשמוע עליך ועל החבר שלך.“

„אה, זה שום דבר, “, אמרה קייטי, „בכל מקרה אני מתארת שרייצ'ל ואתה
מתכוונים ללכת לפגישה, אז לא אפריע לכם. אני בטוחה שרייצ'ל לא תרצה
שאצטרף אליכם.“

„אם להיות כנה,“, אמרה רייצ'ל, „אין לי בעייה עם זה.“ (ואז חשבה בליבה
„מדוע הייתי צריכה לומר את זה?“)

„גם מבחינתי זה בסדר.“ אמר גרג והביט לכיוונה של רייצ'ל במבט משועשע.

„הו, תודה לשניכם.“ אמרה קייטי כשהיא מסדרת את פניה. לרייצ'ל היה נדמה
שקייטי מאושרת מכל העניין.

„טוב, נלך?“ אמרה רייצ'ל, „צריך להזמין מונית או משהו כזה?“

„כן,“ אמר גרג, „היכן יש טלפון?“ והוא הוציא את הפאלם פיילוט שלו מכיסו.

הם הזמינו מונית ובינתיים קייטי סיפרה לגרג על עצמה ועל מה שקרה איתה
ועם רוג'ר כשרייצ'ל מנסה להשחיל מילה. זה חזר על עצמו גם במונית.
רייצ'ל תהתה מה נהג המונית חשב על כך שבחור ושתי בחורות נסעו
במונית למסעדה מפוארת, וזאת שהייתה לבושה בפחות
הידור היא זאת שדיברה עם הבחור כל הזמן. אז היא הגיעה למסקנה שללא קשר
למה שנהג המונית חשב, מה שלא עניין אותה יותר מדי, הרי שלדעתה הסיטואציה
הייתה מביכה ולא נוחה עבורה. ככל שלרייצ'ל היה אכפת מקייטי, היא תהתה אם
זה היה נכון שתהרוס לה את הפגישה הראשונה עם בחור שעשה עליה רושם טוב.

הם הגיעו לבסוף למסעדה, והתיישבו שם. קייטי וגרג המשיכו לדבר ורייצ'ל ביקשה
מהמלצר זמן לפני שיזמינו. כך עבר זמן רב.

„אז אמרת שאתה מהנדס תשתיות מים וביוב. יש משהו חדש שם?“ שאלה קייטי.

„חדש? כן, תמיד יש משהו חדש. “ אמר גרג, „למשל, לאחרונה קראתי במאמר שנכתב באחד העלונים
של הנדסה אזרחית, על כך שהם ביצעו שינוי מסיבי בתשתית בחלק ניכר מהעיר,
וניתקו כל איזור מהאספקה רק פעם אחת ולא יותר משעתיים. הם השתמשו בתוכנית מחשב
כדי לתכנן את הסדר, וזה עבד כמעט לחלוטין לפי התוכנית?“

„באמת?“, אמרה קייטי, „רייצ'ל, תוכניות מחשב הן ההתמחות שלך…“ („תודה שאת סוף כל סוף
משתפת אותי“, חשבה רייצ'ל) „…, כיצד את חושבת שהתוכנית הזאת עבדה?“

„לא יודעת,“ אמרה רייצ'ל, „, אני משערת שזה משהו שקשור לתורת הגרפים, אבל אני לא מתמצאת
במאפיינים של המצב.“

„תורת הגרפים…האמת - אני לא בטוחה מה זה. גרג, אולי תסביר לקייטי את המגבלות והיא
כבר תפתח אלגוריתם או איך שקוראים לזה? בעצם לא, אני לא אבין מזה כלום.“

„כן,“ אמרה רייצ'ל, „זה עלול להוציא אותך מחוץ לשיחה.“ („מה שעשוי שלא להיות דבר רע“, היא חשבה.)

„בכל מקרה,“ אמרה קייטי, „אני צריכה ללכת לשירותים כרגע, אז תסלחו לי.“
והיא קמה ועזבה את שניהם והלכה לשירותים.

„טוב, “אמר גרג במבט משועשע, „על מה את רוצה לדבר?“

רייצ'ל חשבה קצת ואמרה לגרג: „בעצם, גם אני צריכה לשירותים.
אני חושבת ששכחתי לסדר משהו בבית.“

„בסדר, “, אמר גרג, „אני אחכה כאן.“

רייצ'ל ניגשה לשירותים, פתחה את הדלת וראתה שם את קייטי מסדרת את פניה. רייצ'ל
ניגשה אף היא לעשות זאת. „גרג הוא מאוד נחמד.“, אמרה קייטי, „אני נהנית מכל רגע.“

„כן, גם אני“, אמרה רייצ'ל ללא התלהבות יתרה.

קייטי עשתה רושם שהיא מאכלת את מה שרייצ'ל אמרה ואז אמרה „לא עושה רושם שאת
נהנית כל כך. יש בעייה?“

„את רוצה שאני אהיה כנה איתך?“ אמרה רייצ'ל?

„כן, ברור, אנחנו הרי חברות.“ אמרה קייטי.

„אוקיי, אבל לדעתי את לא תרצי לשמוע את מה שאני הולכת לומר.“

„מדוע לא? תמיד אומרים שתמיד כדאי להיות כנים עם אנשים אחרים.“

„ואם את שואלת אותי“, השיבה רייצ'ל, „מה שאת לא יודעת, לא מזיק לך.“

„האמיני לי שכרגע זה מזיק לי. אז שתפי אותי בבקשה.“ אמרה קייטי בגיחוך.

„טוב, “ אמרה רייצ'ל, „שלא תגידי שלא הזהרתי אותך. “ ,ונאנחה, „אני לא נהנית כל כך,
מפני שלדעתי התנחלת על גרג, ואת הורסת לי את הפגישה.“

„אני מתנחלת על גרג?!“ קראה קייטי (רייצ'ל פחדה שמישהו ישים לב) „מה, לעזאזל? את בטוחה
שאת אינך פשוט לא מרוצה מפני שאני מאושרת או משהו כזה?“

רייצ'ל פתחה את פיה כדי לומר משהו, אבל קייטי הפסיקה אותה „כן, אני מבינה עכשיו.
לא משנה. זאת הפגישה שלך. אני לא אפריע לך יותר מכיוון שאני הולכת. להתראות
ואני מקווה שתהני מהפגישה. אני יודעת מתי אני לא רצויה.“

קייטי יצאה משם ואז פנתה שוב לכיוון המראה „רגע, אני נראית בסדר?“ אמרה וסידרה את שערה
בידה, „בעצם זה לא חשוב.“ והלכה משם באופן נמרץ.

רייצ'ל הייתה המומה. „מה בשם הקדוש ברוך הוא קרה כאן?“ היא חשבה לעצמה. היא
הסתכלה במראה, סידרה קצת את המראה שלה (בכל זאת הייתה זו האמתלה שלה ללכת
לשירותים), עד שדעתה נחה עליה, ופנתה ללכת משם.

גרג ישב בשולחן, והיה נראה שהוא משועמם. רייצ'ל הצטרפה אליו. „היכן קייטי?“ הוא שאל.

„קייטי?“ שאלה רייצ'ל.

„כן. היכן היא.“ הוא השיב.

„אה, היא הלכה.“ השיבה רייצ'ל.

„אה, אוקיי.“ אמר גרג וחייך, „טוב, אז נמשיך בפגישה? המלצר בא לשולחן ואמרתי
לו שיחזור כעבור 10 דקות.“

„אין בעייה,“ אמרה רייצ'ל. „מזל שהוא לא שאל <b>מדוע</b> קייטי
הלכה“ היא חשבה לעצמה.

רייצ'ל חככה בדעתה כיצד להתחיל את השיחה.

„אז כיצד נעשית מהנדס תשתיות?“ שאלה רייצ'ל.

„טוב, מאז היותי קטן רציתי להיות שרברב.“ השיב לה גרג.

„שרברב? ברצינות?“ אמרה רייצ'ל בפליאה.

„כן. מאוד מוזר, אבל מה לעשות – זה מה שרציתי להיות.“ אמר גרג, „ביליתי
חלק גדול מהחופשים הגדולים בלהיות שוליה לשרברבים ונהניתי מכל רגע. בכל
מקרה, אחרי שסיימתי תיכון, תכננתי לעבור קורס הכשרה של שרברבות ולסיים
עניין. אבל אבא שלי ניגש אליי ואמר לי: 'גרג, בני היקר, יש לי, ברוך השם,
מספיק כסף כדי שתוכל ללמוד את מה שאתה רוצה באוניברסיטה, אז למה שלא תנצל
את זה. אם תרצה, תוכל להיות שרברב בוגר אוניברסיטה.“

וגרג המשיך „אז הסכמתי איתו, אבל החלטתי ללמוד את הדבר הקרוב ביותר
לשרברבות: הנדסה אזרחית עם התמחות בהנדסת מערכות מים וביוב. ולמרבה הפתעתי
הסתבר לי שחלק ניכר מזה היה די מעניין.“

„אז בסוף נהיית שרברב מדופלם?“

„כן, עברתי את הקורס. אבל עדיין קיבלתי תואר ראשון בהנדסה אזרחית וזה מה
שאני מעדיף לעשות.“

„המממ...“ אמרה רייצ'ל „למצוא שרברב טוב בימינו, ועוד בוגר אוניברסיטה, זה
קשה.“

„טוב, אני לא יכול להעיד על עצמי שאני שרברב טוב. אין הנחתום מעיד על
עיסתו.“ השיב לה גרג.

„גם שרברב רע זה מספיק טוב לצרכים מסוימים.“ אמרה רייצ'ל ונוכחה שגרג
מתפרץ בצחוק.

המלצר ניגש לשולחן אז וחייך בעקבות הצחוק של גרג. „האם ברצונכם להזמין
עכשיו?“ הוא שאל.

רייצ'ל הזמינה מרק מינסטרונה למנה ראשונה וסטייק למנה עיקרית, בעוד שגרג
הזמין מרק מינסטרונה והמבורגר. המלצר רשם את ההזמנה והלך משם.

„טוב, בואי נחזור לשיחה,“ פנה גרג לרייצ'ל, „אמרת שאת אשת מחשבים ועוסקת ב…“

„גרפיקה, כן.“

„אה, יפה. ואת מרוצה?“

„כן, סך הכל.“

„ואיך הגעת לזה?“

„טוב, זה התחיל מגיל צעיר, שבו ההורים שלי קנו לאח שלי ולי מחשב XT וקבעו ששנינו
חייבים לשבת לידו באותו הזמן ואמרו לנו שכדאי לנו ללמוד לתכנת אותו.
אז באופן הזה אני ואח שלי למדנו לתכנת בבייסיק כל מיני משחקים ומצגות שונות,
ואחר-כך למדנו גם שפות אחרות שהיו זמינות שם. לקראת סוף התיכון, התחלנו גם להכיר
את האינטרנט (במחשב מתקדם יותר), ועכשיו אני כבר נמצאת שם רוב הזמן. גם באוניברסיטה
הכרתי מערכות יוניקס, ובכללן לינוקס - אפילו כעבודה מקומית על תחנת עבודה - לא כעבודה
על שרת מרוחק, והגעתי למסקנה שבזה נמצא העתיד של המחשוב הביתי.“

„אני יודע מה זה יוניקס (קצת התעסקתי עם זה באוניברסיטה מן הסתם), אבל לא שמעתי
על לינוקס.“ אמר גרג.

„טוב, לינוקס זה לשם הפשטות 'יוניקס למחשבי PC', והוא גם בד"כ לא עולה כסף
וכן גם הקוד זמין תחת רשיון קוד-פתוח. יש לו שם מגניב, וגם סמל חביב של פינגווין
בשם טאקס (Tux).“

„אוקיי, נחמד. אז מדוע את מתעסקת בגרפיקה?“

„טוב, זה כשרון שרכשתי בעקבות הלימודים שלי באוניברסיטה, שם התנדבתי בעיתונים
ועלונים שונים ככתבת וכמעצבת. זה מצריך ממני לעבוד עם מערכת ההפעלה חלונות 98 אותה
אני למדתי לתעב באופן בלתי ייאמן. בזמני החופשי, אני עדיין מתכנתת דברים, וזה
גם נותן לי יתרון על פני גרפיקאים אחרים שפחות בקיאים ממני בתכנות. סך הכל
השכר הוא טוב, וגם העבודה מעניינת ונותנת סיפוק אז זה מה שאני עושה כרגע.“

„נחמד.“ ענה גרג.

„אז איך עברו עליך הימים הראשונים בעבודה?“ שאלה רייצ'ל.

„בסדר, אני עדיין שוקד על ללמוד את המערכת של העיר הזאת. היא די מורכבת, אבל
נתקלתי בדברים יותר גרועים. כפי שאפשר לצפות ממשרד ציבורי, הרי שהמחשב שעומד
לרשותי לא מתוצר באופן הטוב ביותר, אבל אני מניח שאוכל להתמודד איתו בעבודה
השוטפת.“

„כן, שמעתי על הסימפטום הזה.“ אמרה רייצל.

„אז אני מבין שיש לך אח?“ אמר גרג.

„כן.“

„מה הוא עושה?“

„הוא כרגע עובד לפני הלימודים באוניברסיטה בתכנות. הוא מסתובב ברחבי
ארצות-הברית, ועובד במה שמזדמן. הוא מרוצה מכך שהוא משתמש בלינוקס ואני
מקנאה בו. אבל סך הכל אנחנו ביחסים טובים.“

„יפה מאוד. לי יש שתי אחיות - אחת מבוגרת ממני ואחת יותר צעירה. הצעירה עדיין בתיכון,
והמבוגרת כרגע עובדת על דוקטורט בבלשנות באוניברסיטה.“

„בלשנות… “ אמרה רייצ'ל „איזה יופי, אני תמיד בעד אנשים ששוקדים על שיפור
הדיבור והתקשורת שלהם. קראתי במקום כלשהו, שהשפה האנושית היא בראש ובראשונה
כלי של חשיבה, והפונקציה שלה ככלי תקשורת הוא משני. גם נטען שם שעל-ידי עיוות
מילים גם מעוותים את המחשבה.“

„כן, זכור לי משהו כזה.“

אז המלצר הביא את האוכל, והשניים ניגשו לאכול.

„אז מה הייתה ההתמחות המשנית שלך באוניברסיטה?“ שאל גרג את רייצ'ל.

„למדתי משחק. אבל אני לא שחקנית - אני רק משחקת אחת כזאת בטלוויזיה.“

גרג התפקע מצחוק. „כן, עושה רושם שיש לך כשרון לבדיחות של לוגיקה.“

„כן, אני טיפוס רציונליסטי.“

„תמיד היית כזאת.“ שאל גרג?

„אספר לך סיפור. “ אמרה רייצ'ל, „כשהייתי בת עשר והייתי פעם אחת עם אבא
בקניון קרוב לחג המולד, ביקשתי ממנו לעמוד לתור לסנטה קלאוס ולבקש ממנו
מתנה. הוא לא הרשה לי, ואמר שיסביר לי למה כשנגיע הבייתה.“

„כשהגענו הבייתה,“ היא המשיכה, „ישבנו ביחד על הספה והוא הסביר לי שסנטה קלאוס אינו
קיים, שהוא דמות דמיונית, ושזה רק איש שמתחפש אליו. 'בקיצור, ' הוא אמר לי,
'אם את רוצה לבקש מתנה, בקשי ממני. לא בטוח שאסכים, אבל זה עדיין יהיה יותר
יעיל עבורך מאשר אילו תבקשי זאת מסנטה'. למחרת, התווכחתי עם חברות שלי על כך
ולבסוף כדי להוכיח את צדקתי, הסתובבתי איתן ברחבי השכונה והראיתי להן שיש
יותר מסנטה קלאוס אחד בו זמנית.“

„תמיד היית כזאת לוגיקנית?“

„אני נוטה להאמין שהלוגיקניות שלי גברה עם הזמן.

בכל מקרה, מספר ימים לאחר-מכן, ההורים של החברות שלי באו בטענות להורים
שלי, מדוע הם צריכים לנפץ אשליות 'בלתי מזיקות' כדבריהם כאלה. אבא שלי הגן
על התנהגותו בכך שאמר שזו אמונה לא-רציונלית, שאין להאכיל בה את הילדים.
'ומה הייתי אמור להגיד לה אילו היינו יהודים' הוא אמר להם. חלק מההורים
ניסו לתקן את העוול על-ידי כך שאמרו שיש סנטה קלאוס אמיתי בקוטב הצפוני,
אבל החברות שלי לא האמינו להם.“

„סיפור נחמד.“

„כן.“

רייצ'ל וגרג סיימו את ארוחת הערב שלהם והזמינו מונית חזרה לביתם. לאחר שהמונית
עצרה ליד בית-הדירות של רייצ'ל, גרג והיא יצאו החוצה. „טוב,“ אמר גרג, „נהניתי
הערב מאוד.“.

„אז אני מבינה שקייטי מצאה חן בעיניך.“ אמרה רייצ'ל.

„אני לא מדבר עליה.“

„רגע - לא העדפת אותה על פניי?“

„לא, אני מעדיף אותך.“

רייצ'ל חייכה. „טוב, אני שמחה שהייתה לנו פגישה טובה.“

וגרג אמר: ”גם אני.“. לאחר זמן מה הוסיף: ”טוב, כדאי שאקח את המונית חזרה
לדירה שלי. המונה פועם.”

“כן, להתראות. נשתמע כבר.”

“להתראות.”

גרג נכנס למונית, שעד מהרה נסעה משם. רייצ'ל נכנסה לבניין ועלתה במדרגות לדירה שלה.

</s>

<s id="wednesday">

<title>יום רביעי</title>

רייצ'ל התעוררה למשמע הפעמון של הדלת. היא קמה מהמיטה, הסתכלה על השעון
המעורר שלה וראתה שהשעה היא רבע לשש. מי לעזאזל צריך להעיר אותה רבע שעה
לפני שעת הקימה שלה. היא לבשה מכנסיים וניגשה לפתוח את הדלת.

כשפתחה אותה ראתה את ההורים שלה עומדים מעבר לפתח. „שלום אבא, שלום
אימא“, היא אמרה וקולה לא הסתיר את מורתה מביקור פתע זה.

„היי מותק, “ אמרה לה אמה, „הרגע הגענו מהמטוס, החלטנו לבקר אותך בעיר
הזרה שבא העזת לגור.“

„אתם יודעים, יש סיבה שעשיתי את זה...“

„ברור שיש. את מעולם לא פעלת על-סמך דחפים בלבד.“ („ממש לא“ חשבה
רייצ'ל)

„בכל מקרה, מה נשמע אצלך ומדוע את לא מתקשרת מספיק?“

„אני בסדר, ואני לא מתקשרת מספיק כי אני עסוקה.“ (זה התרוץ הכי טוב שעלה
על ראשה) „בכל מקרה, עכשיו לא הזמן הכי טוב בשבילכם לבקר.“

„מדוע, יש אצלך מישהו?“ שאל אותה אביה, בלי נימה של רוגז.

„להגיד את האמת לא.“

„טוב, זאת הבעייה שלך.“ אמרה לה אימא.

לדעתה של רייצ'ל היא ירשה את סכום חוסר-השפיויות של הוריה. אביה של
רייצ'ל למד רפואה אבל אחרי 5 שנים של טיפול בחולים הוא החליט לעבור למחקר.
הוא עשה כבר תואר שני ושלישי בביולוגיה אך עדיין האמין שהוא רופא בדם.
אולם, רייצ'ל ואחיה סיפרו תמיד שהוא „מדען“ משום שרופא נראה להם שגרתי
מידי. אימה של רייצ'ל למדה ביחד עם אביה באוניברסיטה, לתואר ראשון בכימיה,
אך מאז הולדת רייצ'ל עבדה בעבודות מזדמנות של חצי-משרה שלא היו קשורות
להכשרתה.

„בכל מקרה, אני עסוקה היום“, אמרה רייצ'ל.

-------------------


----------------

„אתה יודע,“ אמרה רייצ'ל, „האופי שלך איננו מסתכם למספר שלם.“

„טעות בידך“, ענה רודולף, „אופיי מסתכם למספר היפר-קומפלקסי שלם
למהדרין.“

„השאלה היא אם הערך המוחלט שלו שלם.“

„לא חשבתי על זה, אבל לדעתי כן.“

-----------------

„האם תמיד היית כזאת רציונלית?“ שאל גרג?

----------------

„רודולף אייזנברג? את מתלוצצת? הוא חלומי.“

„איך בדיוק הוא חלומי?“

„הוא גאון!“

„גאון שמסרב להודות בכך אך למעשה בטוח שהוא כן גאון.“

„כן, בראיון שקראתי איתו, הוא אמר שהוא בפרוש לא גאון. בכל מקרה, את
אומרת שהוא עכשיו במילווקי?“

„או לפחות מישהו שהוא טוען שזה הוא.“

„אני חייבת לפגוש אותו.“

„אז בואי לבית שלי ביום ראשון, כי הוא עושה מין כזאת תצוגת אופנה – קו
נטוי – הצגה, באותו הזמן.“ („למה לעזאזל הייתי צריכה להגיד את זה?“ חשבה
רייצ'ל לעצמה)

„באמת? תודה. את החברה הכי טובה בכל היקום.“ (וגם אחד האנשים הכי טיפשים
חשבה רייצ'ל לעצמה)

„אז להתראות ביום ראשון.“

„כן. להתראות, ואני אוהבת אותך.“

------------

מספר אנשים עזרו לאשלי לשכב על הספה. היה ניכר מהבעות הפנים שלה ומהאנחות
שלה שהיא די סובלת. רייצ'ל הסתכלה סביבה. שני הוריה ישבו על שני כסאות זה
ליד זה, לא מדברים, לצד אחיה. אביה נראה קצת מוטרד מלראות את אשלי סובלת,
אך נשאר יושב בכסאו. רייצ'ל ניגשה אליו.

„אבא, אתה רופא.“ היא אמרה לו. נראה היה שלקח לו מעט זמן לקלוט זאת ואז
אמר: „הו! נכון!“ ואז ניגש לעזור לאשלי. רייצ'ל התיישבה לצד אחיה. „קיוויתי
שלעולם לא אצטרך להגיד את זה.“

„כן, גם אני.“ אמר לה וחיבק אותה מתוך הזדהות.

--------------

„אז איך אתה מסווג את עצמך בקשת הפוליטית?“

„זה ישמע די מוזר עבור גרמני...“ השיב רודולף „אבל אני אובייקטיביסט. זו
פשוט הפילוסופיה המשוגעת ביותר שמתאימה לשגעון הפרטי שלי.“

„אם להגיד את האמת, צריך להיות קצת אובייקטיסט כדי להפנים את הספרים של
איין רנד, כך שפעולת ההתאבייקטיבסטות דורשת מעט Bootstrapping.“

„מה זה בוט-סטרפינג?“ שאלה אשלי.

„זה מושג בתחום המחשבים “ השיבה רייצ'ל, „שאומר שצריך להשתמש בדבר מסוים
כדי לבנות או לאתחל את עצמו. אני אתן לך דוגמא: יש מהדר של שפת C בשם gcc
שכתוב מראש בשפת C.“

„אז איך מהדרים אותו?“

„משתמשים במהדר אחר, או בגרסה ישנה יותר שלו.“

„או שמתקינים חבילה שמישהו אחר קימפל עבורך...“ הוסיף רודולף.

----------------

„'אני', 'אני' ! “

„את מה?“

„'אני' זאת התשובה לשאלת החיים, היקום והכל.“

„באמת? אני חשבתי שהתשובה לה היא 42.“

לרייצ'ל מאוד בא לתת לגרג אגרוף. אבל הייתה לה מספיק שליטה עצמית מכדי
לעשות זאת ולכן רק אמרה „אהההההפפפף“ והלכה משם. גרג ראה אותה יוצאת אל
המרפסת.

„מה הבעייה של רייצ'ל?“ שאל גרג את הנוכחים בחדר.

„היא שאלה אותי מי האיש החזק ביותר בעולם ועניתי לה שזה אני.“

„טוב זה מסביר דברים אחדים.“

גרג יצא אל המרפסת וראה את רייצ'ל עומדת שם ומרפרפת בתסריט. הוא ניגש
לעברה. „רודולף סיפר לי ששאלת אותו מי האיש החזק בעולם. אז זאת שאלת החיים,
היקום והכל.“

„לעת עתה, לפחות“, אמרה רייצ'ל וחייכה חצי-חיוך.

„אני מבין שעבר עלייך שבוע קשה, ועכשיו את גם צריכה לשחק בהצגת-האופנה
הזאת.“

„זה נכון.“ אמרה ואז השתרר שקט לקצת רגע.

„אני ממש מחבב את רודולף.“ אמר גרג.

„באמת?“ אמרה רייצ'ל „אף על פי שהוא האדם הכי גאוותן, ועוד באופן הכי
(כביכול) צנוע שאי פעם הכרת?“

„כן, שמתי לב. לא, זה לא מפריע לי כל כך. למעשה זה חלק מהיופי
שבו.“

„המממ...“ המהמה רייצ'ל, „אם לחשוב על זה, אולי הוא לא כל כך גרוע.
ולפחות הוא פתר את החידה שהטרידה אותי מאז תחילת השבוע.“

„בקשר למי האדם החזק בעולם?“

„כן.“

„טוב. אני מצטער שאמרתי שזה '42'.“

„שמע“, אמרה רייצ'ל ואחזה בידיו, „זה יהיה מאוד חשוב לי אם תלך ליציע
לראות את ההצגה.“

„מדוע?“ אמר גרג, „כל האקשן נמצא כאן...“

„בכל זאת, בתור... אני לא יודעת... החבר שלי.“

„את מחשיבה אותי בתור החבר שלך?“ אמר גרג כשהוא אוחז את כתפיה
בידיו.

„לעת עתה, לפחות“ ענתה רייצ'ל. היא נישקה אותו ומייד שניהם התחילו
להתמזמז.

„איפה רייצ'ל“ שמעה רייצ'ל את קולה של אימה מתוך הדירה, ואז ראתה אותה
פותחת את הדלת של המרפסת. „אווו“ אמרה האם כשהיא מביטה על הזוג.

רייצ'ל הפסיקה מהר להתנשק עם גרג ואמרה לאמא שלה: „היי אמא, כל כך נחמד
שהצטרפת אלינו כאן. בדיוק דיברנו על... אהממ... נו טוב, לא בדיוק
דיברנו.“

„אני אלך ליציע לראות את החלק השני של ההצגה.“ אמר גרג, ואז עקף את אימה
של רייצ'ל ויצא מהמרפסת.

„טוב, אמא, “ אמרה רייצ'ל, „לי יש תסריט לשנן.“

---------------

„טוב, “ אמרה רייצ'ל לשאר השחקנים, „כל אחד יודע שכאשר מדובר בבגדים של
רודולף אייזנברג – סימן רשום – בערבון מוגבל, כל הזכויות שמורות תחת ה-GNU
General Public License – צריך ללבוש לפחות שלושה בגדים שלו ביום.“

------------------

„בניגוד למה שרייצ'ל כאן אמרה, העיצובים שלי אינם מופצים תחת ה – GNU
General Public License, למי שיודע מה זה. לפחות לא כרגע. אבל אתם מוזמנים
לקנות אותם בכל מקרה.“

רייצ'ל שמעה את אייזנברג אומר דברים אלה כשהיא עומדת על הבמה ביחד עם שאר
השחקנים בהצגת-האופנה. היא חייכה חיוך טיפשי, עמדה בפוזה טיפשית, ובאופן
כללי ניסתה להראות טיפשית עד כמה שרק ניתן. (ולדעתה די הצליחה).

„רייצ'ל מחליפה את אשלי הלוואי, שנקעה את רגלה. אבל, אל תדאגו, אתם תראו
אותה מספיק בתצוגת האופנה הבאה שלי, יהיה הפורמט שלה אשר יהיה.“

----------------

„הגידו לי, יש איזה סיכוי שהאפיפיור החדש מת היום?“

„לא הודיעו על זה בחדשות.“

„האם ביל גייטס נהרג בהתרסקות של מטוס, חס וחלילה?“

„לא.“

„אוטובוס פגע בלינוס טורוולדס? שוב פעם, חס וחלילה.“

„לא חושב.“

„מצוין. “ אמרה רייצ'ל כשהיא נופלת על הספה. „יש סיכוי שהשבוע הזה יהיה
יותר שפוי.“
