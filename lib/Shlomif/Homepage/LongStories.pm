<p>
While the birth parents of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala">Queen Padmé Amidala</a>
of the Naboo of <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse">the Selinaverse</a>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Alvord">Tiffany Alvord</a> , b. 1992)
were killed in a starship crash when she was 1 years old, she was adopted by her aunt,
the Duchess Elizabeth Amidala (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman_filmography">Natalie
Portman</a>), and her aunt's husband Darth Vader, who volunteered to act as King in effect until
Padme's coming of age. As a result, Padmé had a happy childhood until she turned 18
at 2010 and was ready to become the bona fide monarch of Naboo.
</p>

<p>
Padme already learned enough about managing a planet country by volunteering
to help Vader, and he encouraged her to do so. On the surface, she is happy:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
She is the richest person in Naboo and one of the richest women in the galaxy.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
She has enough time to contribute on Internet content and code sharing sites.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
She has many supporting friends, including her boyfriend Anakin Skywalker
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/jakecoco/about">Jake Coco</a>)
a promising Jedi-wannabe who is about her age, with aspirations
for joining the mysterious but revered jedi order of Siths, of which only Vader
and <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Sidious">Emperor Palpatine</a>
are the known extant members.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
In practice though, there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">the Sword of Damocles</a>:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
Critics on online publications and social media who are unhappy with every
choice she makes.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
A poorly executed takeover attempt by a "real life" celebrity
(<a href="[% base_path %]humour/bits/facts/Emma-Watson/">Emma Watson</a>)
thought to be flawless.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Her boyfriend being so busy with his studies that he becomes awfully laconic
even in his emails.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Her spirit friends, who are animated characters from
<a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/My_Little_Pony_Friendship_is_Magic_Wiki"><i>My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</i></a>
and other franchises, who appear at the seemingly least desirable moments, and
whom everyone can see, hear, photograph, and record, but whom many people
believe are some kind of trick.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
And her biggest pet peeve: her positive bank balance which keeps getting
