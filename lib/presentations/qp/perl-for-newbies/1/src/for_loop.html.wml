<p>
The for loop enables us to iterate over a sequence of numbers and repeat
the same set of operations for each number.
</p>

<p>
For example, the following program prints all the numbers from 1 to 100:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/for_loop/1to100.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
Some explanations about the syntax:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<code>$i</code> is the iteration variable. It receives the value 1, then the
value 2, then 3 and so forth until it is equal to 100, afterwards the
loop terminates.
</li>

<li>
The curly brackets (<code>{ ... }</code>) encapsulate the loop block. The loop
block is executed once for each value <code>$i</code> accepts. Within that
block, called the loop body, you can use <code>$i</code> and you'll get its
current value.
</li>

</ol>


<p>
We can nest loops, so for example the following program prints the
multiplication board:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/for_loop/multiplication_board.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
You may have noticed the program's comments. In perl comments start with the
sharp sign (<code>#</code>) and extend to the end of the line. Writing the
multiplication boards with the labels that indicate which numbers are being
multiplied is left as an exercise to the reader.
