<p>
I dedicate this section to the various pieces of computer graphics I
designed, photographs I took and published here, and computerised music
which I created. I will explain how I created the graphic art, so you can
shamelessly duplicate my efforts and create similar art.

I’m not much of a photographer, but I still enjoy taking photographs using
my digital camera, and putting them online under a permissive licence to
enrich the commons. Most of the photos I took are now
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/shlomif/">on my <b>Flickr account</b></a>.
