<p>
This article aims to explain why I do not trust non-open-source software
programs and libraries, and would rather not depend on them, even if they are
technically superior to their open source alternatives in some respects.

<p>
In this essay, I would like to explain why I do not trust
programs that are not
[% FOSS %] and instead are more restrictive. (I have
previously told this story as part of
<a href="http://better-scm.shlomifish.org/docs/shlomif-evolution.html">a
different essay</a>, but it was easy to miss there.)
</p>

<p>
In any case, the <a href="http://better-scm.shlomifish.org/bk/">BitKeeper
version control system</a> is now quite obscure, due to the advent of quality
open-source distributed version control systems such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29">Git</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial">Mercurial</a>. However,
several years ago, it was used by many developers of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux kernel</a>, and the
demise of its gratis version was in fact the impetus for the creation of
Git (and later - Mercurial). Several years ago, some time before Linus Torvalds
started using BitKeeper as the version control system of the kernel’s source code,
I ran into a limitation of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System">CVS</a>,
a popular, but limited, open-source version control system, which I used back
then. As a result, I went looking for an alternative, and after reading an
out-of-date article about BitKeeper (which said its source was available under
a mostly open source licence), decided to use it and its bkbits.net service.
</p>

<p>
At first, I was quite happy using BitKeeper for some of my projects, but then I
posted a question to the mailing list, asking where I can find the source,
which was implied to be available on the BitKeeper site. Larry McVoy
(= BitKeeper’s main creator and maintainer) replied by saying that they
opted to remove the source code, because some users modified it to remove the
restrictions, and allowed them to violate the licensing of the gratis version
and prevent them from paying for the commercial version. He also noted that
availability of source, meant that, in practice, your software was Public
Domain, and that they provide the sources for people they can trust,
in private.
</p>

<p>
At that point, I figured out that I don't have an immediate need for the
source, and that perhaps in the future, I can win BitMover (= BitKeeper’s
parent company) trust and gain access to it. So I continued using BitKeeper.
</p>

<p>
That changed, however, when Mr. McVoy announced a licence change to BitKeeper
(while requiring all users of the gratis version to upgrade) that
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/shlomif/diary/78.html">I found
unacceptable</a>, and caused me to seek a different alternative. This
caused an unpleasant exchange between me and the BitKeeper developers,
and made me lose some of the repositories I hosted on bkbits.net.
</p>

<p>
From that moment on, I realised that I cannot really trust non-open-source
software, because even if I am allowed to continue to use its previous version
after a licence change, then it may accumulate bugs or stop being runnable
on my systems, or stop being supported, and I would rather not risk such crises
happening. To quote
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard
Stallman</a>: <q>Every non-free [= non-FOSS] program has a lord, a master —
and if you use the program, he is your master</q>.
</p>

<p>
The end of the BitKeeper story, was that after evaluating a few open-source
alternatives, I settled on using the open-source Subversion, and later on
also started using Mercurial and Git. Furthermore, from then on, I often
refused to look at and evaluate proprietary programs. Lately, many open-source
developers have become infatuated with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Text">Sublime Text</a>, but
I am not willing to even try it, because it is not open-source, so I will
never have to depend on it.
</p>

<p>
Despite all that, I still license most of my original open
source software under
non-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">Copyleft</a>,
permissive, licences,
because the GPLv2 and the GPLv3 are incompatible, both
with one another, and with many other open-source licences; because
I know of at least three different interpretations to the GPL
(GNU’s one in the GPL FAQ, the Linux kernel's one, and the draconian
<a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/COPYING" rel="nofollow">Nmap
interpretation</a>); because I want my code to be of the maximal available
use without the need to consult a lawyer; and because I don't want to be
worried about how it will possibly be abused, when I don't care if it will.
I'm still using GPLed software, in the hope that I won't get sued.
See my <a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/computers/open-source/foss-licences-wars/rev2/">"FOSS Licences Wars"</a> essay.
</p>

<p>
To sum up, I do not wish to rely on non-FOSS, because it may mean these
software applications later become unavailable to me, in a similar
manner to what was the case with BitKeeper. I hope you can relate to that,
and, if not, you may likely run into a similar situation in the future,
which was also the case for the Linux kernel project, with the demise of
the gratis BitKeeper version altogether.
