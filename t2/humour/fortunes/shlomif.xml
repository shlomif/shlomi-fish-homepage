            <p>A Jewish Deduction</p>

            <p>
The Bible dictates that "Thou shalt not seethe [= cook] a kid [= young goat]
in his mother's milk." To avoid any possibility of breaking that regulation, 
the Jewish tradition ruled that it also applies to female goats, to mature
goats, and to the meat and milk of two completely unrelated goats. It is 
also forbidden to eat the meat with fresh milk, and it applies to beef 
and mutten as well (including mixing the milk and meat of two different
beasts). Finally, chicken, which are incapable of milk production, may not
be eaten along with any mammal's milk either. 
</p>

<p>
We are fortunate that most mathematicians were not Jewish. Otherwise, it
would have been forbidden to divide by all numbers between -1 and 1.

Sure I did. I sat at one point of an IRC channel, and someone
tested me. Eventually it was discovered that I am a computer, but it
turned out the other side was an Eliza program. Strangely enough, I could
not detect that the latter fact was true.

Judging by IRC or AOL, randomly would do just fine ;-)

            And thank you for applying this patch. But to be honest, I'm a little
disappointed. I expected it won't go in so easily and will trigger some
discussion here. But there was none. No typo corrections ("you mis-spelled
'floccinaucinihilipilification'"); no flames ("this patch is the worst
thing since non-sliced bread"). Nothing.</p>

<p>
Someone should do something about it. This direction is not healthy for
p5p. Seriously.</p>

Are you kidding?

CVS is not advanced as:

1. Microsoft Visual SourceSafe - the only sane choice for good data integrity 
and portability.

2. tarballs/zip-files and patches. This one excels in convenience, and 
robustness.

CVS is a very advanced version control system, however. I do wish that 
Subversion (which is a VCS that I have to use against my will) was as good as 
it is.

      <quote><body><p>A few weeks ago, I've been to Freenode's #perl, talking to merlyn and other
guys, when we got to discuss the Biblical "Tower of Babel Myth". As it turned
out, the commonly perceived interpretation was not the one most scholars find
as more sensible, which is the one we ended up being taught at Junior High
School. </p><p>What most people think is something like that: </p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
The people spoke to each other in the same language, concentrated in one place,
and decided to build a tower high enough so they can reach God. God, a small
dwarf who lived in the sky, was afraid of the efforts of these people, because
he feared they'll reach him. So he casted an 8th level Spell of Language
Fragmentation, caused these people to speak in different tongues, and without
being able to understand each other, they ended up spreading across the Earth.
God was relieved and returned to his dwarfish deeds, as dwarfs do.

          <text><![CDATA[> This reminds me of Paul Graham's articles, in which he claims that LISP

No. 1 is true, naturally. No. 2 is not true - I know LISP but I prefer Perl. 
Other like Python, etc. The reasons I don't prefer LISP are:

1. The standards of Common LISP and Scheme don't define anything practical.
2. LISP is at the moment incredibly verbose.
3. As Larry Wall noted, all LISP code comes in parenthesis and so it all looks 
the same. (Perl is the exact opposite in this regard).
4. I cannot make heads nor tails of serious LISP code. Many LISPers create so 
many macros and use them along with regular LISP code, so you keep having to 
refer to the previous definitions, and make a lot of research to get you 
started.

SICP Scheme is easy and fun. But serious LISP code can take too much time to 
understand. OTOH, recently I had little problem reading the source code of 
other Perl programmers, and extending it or fixing bugs. (likewise for 
Python).

I logged in to FreeNode's #debian channel, where there are many knowledgable
people to ask it. The first answer I got was "RTFM". So, I read the wget man

this has been the last straw. </p><p>I composed my own acronym. Just like RTFM is "Read the Fabulous Manual" and
STFW is "Search the Fabulous Web", then JATFM is "Just Answer the Fabulous

ask him to RTFM, which is just going to annoy him. I think the RTFM mantra has
done a lot of damage in the UNIX/Linux world, and I hope JATFMing would prove

I don't suppose we should propose that as an alternative to Perl Gods, there 
should at least be Perl Saints:

http://www.stallman.org/saint.html

Of course, I'm not sure what being a Perl saint would imply. Using nothing but 
Perl? (Including not C in which perl 5 is written?)

Oh well.

I almost feel honor bound now to start a noise band called The Randal
Schwartz Condition.  I could shout his rants into a microphone while
the rest of the band flogged a newbie live on stage.

A: You Linux kids are so lucky. When we were using Windows 95 and Windows 3.11 
it kept getting stuck and we lost all our data. We had to reboot it.
</p>

<p>
B: You used Windows 95! Lucky Bastard! When I was your age, we used DOS on CGA 
screens, and we were lucky if we had 4 colors, much less a true windowing 
environment.
</p>

<p>
C: You had DOS with graphics? Lucky bastard! When I was your age, I used 
VT-100 terminals connected to a VAX. 128 characters should be enough for 
everybody?
</p>

<p>
D: Visual Terminals? When I was your age, we used teletypes on a PDP-11: the 
computer printed on paper - very slowly. Can you imagine cat'ing a really 
long document?
</p>

<p>
E: Teletypes were heaven compared to the punch cards that I was using. Imagine 
going over to the computer with a large amount of punch cards and then 
dropping them all.
</p>

<p>
F: Punch cards! What is this talk about punch cards? We inputted machine code 
direclty using buttons and LEDs.
</p>

<p>
G: And all <b>we</b> had were NAND gates!

<saying who="rindolf">Which PG deemed as unnecessary.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Doesn&#39;t look like the 100-years language to me.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Which is why - Spark!</saying>
<saying who="pmurias">why not just write an s-expression p6 dialect?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pmurias: could be.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pmurias: it&#39;s another approach.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">But some things make sense in Lisp and not in p6.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">For example, Perl does not like to use + for string or list concat.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">vixey: as TimToady said people hate abstractions.</saying>
<saying who="vixey">yes they will rindolf</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">They want things to work out of the box.</saying>
<saying who="vixey">A program is many many totally newly defined procedures</saying>
<saying who="vixey">just renaming one thing is nothing in the context of a big program</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vixey: &quot;let&#39;s spend 3 days creating a new language, and 1 day implementing the solution with it.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="TimToady">if it would take 10 days without the new language, it&#39;s worth it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">TimToady: yeah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">TimToady: but this is the CL mentality.</saying>
<saying who="vixey">no it&#39;s not</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Sometimes you can take 1 day to write an API.</saying>
<saying who="vixey">CL is too diverse you cannot generalize like that</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vixey: I meant a common idiom there.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I think I&#39;ll /quit and do something productive.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Like work on Spark.</saying>

                And by putting this on the web, they know that you know.

                Richard M. Stallman (RMS) decides to release his brand-new
                editor, "Emacs" on the CPAN with its first version 29.999.99.
                In order to package it, he invokes the trusty ol'
                module-starter (see http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Starter/
                ) which creates a skeleton of a CPAN distribution for him.
            </p>

            <p> 
                He fills in the skeleton with the actual code of Emacs, types
                "perl Build.PL", and "./Build test" and makes sure all the
                tests pass. Then he types "./Build config --gui" and gets a
                nice GUI to configure the various parameters of the Module
                meta-data.[M-B-Data]
            </p>

            <p> 
                In the GUI, Richard goes to the Trove categorisation tab, and
                selects categories. This is done in a similar way to
                Freshmeat's project categorisation dialog (a list of options to
                the left, with selected options to the right and arrows to move
                them left or right, while allowing multiple select options.).
                He chooses such categories as "Programming Language :: Lisp",
                and "Intended Audience :: Emacs Users", "Operating System ::
                GNU", and "Topic :: Editors". (Note: I believe the category
                list should be fetched using a public web-service to keep them
                up-to-date.)

            <p>
                After several weeks of having the editor on CPAN, Richard has
                received many patches, and wrote a lot of code on his own. Now
                Emacs is not only an editor but a calendar tool, an Eliza
                program, a web browser, a mail user agent and many other
                things.
            </p>

            <p> 
                So in order to release version 30.000.00 he needs to update the
                categorisation.  He runs ./Build config --gui again, and adds
                more categories. However, he enters too many categories
                (because Emacs now does them all), and the GUI refuses  to save
                the file because it will overflow the limit that the
                web-service specified the CPAN classification services allow to
                handle. So Richard keeps only the important categories, adds
                more tags, and saves it.
            </p>

            <p>
                He then tests the distribution again, and uploads the new
                distribution to the CPAN.
            </p>

            <p>
Bill Gates, CEO of Microsoft decides to use Richard Stallman's Emacs as the
basis of his company's state-of-the-art product Microsoft Editing Macrosâ„¢ 
Enterprise Edition XP .NET Professional. However since MS Editing Macrosâ„¢ is 
a commercial, proprietary program which he intends to sell at computer stores, 
Bill is not going to upload it to the CPAN. He builds upon Emacs, sends 
patches to  Richard and learns a lot about it.
</p>

<p>
When he's finished building Microsoft Editing Macrosâ„¢ he surfs to the
Emacs homepage on CPAN, and adds some categories and tags of his own.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, enough people like Bill tag and categorise Emacs, and it gains
more classification.

              <p> Well, it's not a threat - it's a warning, and he won't be
                  harmed much by acting against my advice. A threat is
                  something like "Stop posting political posts or I will burn
                  your house, rape your wife and daughters, banish you to the
                  middle of Antarctica, convert all your Perl code to PHP, and
                  then post it on thedailywtf.com." 
              </p>

              <p> Regarding what you say that "no one cares if you
                  unsubscribe", then this reminds me of what Fred Brooks says
                  in "The Mythical Man-Month": "How does a project becomes
                  late? One day at a time.". If you're not careful, you might 
                  lose a large percent of your blog's readership, one 
                  subscriber at a time.

              <p>PHP error debug list:</p>
              <p>1) did you use the correct argument order? if you're a good programmer, use the *reverse* from what you think it is. see if it works. no? you're not a good programmer, or you learned php's braindeadness and can go on to step 2).</p>
              <p>
                  2) did you think about your code? if so, don't. php will do it for you so you can do mindbogglingly stupid stuff, such as not escape the data that goes into your sql queries.

<saying who="Makoryu">(A vim clone in Perl)</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">good question. there&#39;s one in javascript :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: actually , it&#39;s a vi clone.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Writing a vi clone is much easier than writing a vim clone.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Just like writing a Scheme clone is much easier than writing a Perl 6 implementation.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Unless you&#39;re Chuck Norris.</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">rindolf: darn.. he already wrote a vim in perl6?</saying>
<saying who="moritz_">no, he scared K&amp;R into writing it ;-)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: Chuck Norris is the ghost author of the entire Debian GNU/Linux distribution.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: and he wrote it in 24 hours, while taking snack breaks.</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">rindolf: yes, I know - he published slackware under the pseudonym patrick volkerding...</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Chuck Norris read the entire Wikipedia. Twice.</saying>
<saying who="araujo">the second time includes fixing all its errors</saying>
<saying who="moritz_">but he didn&#39;t commmit his changes, it seems</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">moritz_: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">LOL.</saying>
<saying who="araujo">Chuck Norris doesn&#39;t commit changes, the changes commit for him</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">It is generated right in the first time.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Bugs are too afraid to reproduce on Chuck Norris&#39; computer.</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">.o(I see a chuck norris release on the horizon... ;)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: :-)</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">we could ask chuck norris if he&#39;s willing to promote the star release.. ;)) (which probably kill the entire internet due to laughter.. :)</saying>

<saying who="d3x">btw, you can do mplayer -dumpaudio -dumpfile file.mp3</saying>
<saying who="d3x">no need to reencode</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">This -dumpfile is a nice trick.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Is it new?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I wonder when mplayer will hit 1.0 already.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">All the stuff I saw told me to use WAV and then encode.</saying>
<saying who="d3x">mplayer and 1.0? i&#39;m not really sure it&#39;s their goal</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">They will stay at 1.0RC-foo forever?</saying>
<saying who="d3x">although i would be glad if they had some sensible versioning</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Yes.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">At the moment perl-Mojolicious is at 0.999924.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">At least perl-Moose hit 1.00</saying>
<saying who="d3x">lol</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Without any substantial changes from 0.99.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">But you&#39;ve got to upgrade somehow.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perl-Moose is MDV/RH notation, but I like it.</saying>
<saying who="d3x">imo it&#39;s just stupid not to release 1.0</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I dislike libmoose-perl</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Yes.</saying>
<saying who="d3x">wine did so and now they have normal versioning</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Though most of my CPAN modules are sub-1.0.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">http://search.cpan.org/~shlomif/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I think except for one  module (where I used 0.2.0 0.4.0 and eventually hit 0.8.0 and had to go to 1.000) all my 1.0 and above modules are adopted.</saying>
<saying who="d3x">they are sub-1.0, but they are not 0.9.999.2010.03.11-rc5</saying>
<saying who="d3x">:)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">One of them used the CVS revisions as  versions.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">d3x : LOL.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Yes.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">d3x: can I quote you on that?</saying>
<saying who="d3x">i say it&#39;s stupid to make releases up to 0.9.something and then not to release 1.0</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I collect quotes on my homepage.</saying>
<saying who="d3x">sure you can</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">At the moment I have freecell-solver-2.42.0</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">But I hope the new release will be 3.0.0</saying>
<saying who="d3x">the one that was bought by freecell enterprise? :D</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I&#39;ve left GNOME and gtk+/glib behind.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">d3x yes.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Freecell Solver Enterprisesâ„¢ Inc.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Ah, so you&#39;ve seen that.</saying>
<saying who="d3x">yes, you posted a link on #debian</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Yes.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">You should add a digest to the version.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf"> 0.9.999.2010.03.11-rc5-adc83b19e793491b1c6ea0fd8b46cd9f32e592fc</saying>
