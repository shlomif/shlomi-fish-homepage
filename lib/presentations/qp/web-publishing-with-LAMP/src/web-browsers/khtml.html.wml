Market share: a small percent of the UNIX workstations, and a relatively
large percent of people using Mac OS X.

MSIE-only sites will be compatible), as long as they don't contradict the
W3C standards. (still many sites break.)

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<points>
<li>
If your client workstation is Windows, you may have problems testing it. (
KDE may or may not be ported to cygwin and a Win32-based X-Windows server).
</li>
<li>
The problem is that many pages can break in it because of its many bugs.
</li>
<li>
I recommend testing in it, but it's not absolutely necessary.
