<a href="http://www.oberhumer.com/mfx/">Markus Oberhumer</a>
(of <a href="http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/pysol/">PySol</a>
fame) asked if I thought about converting Freecell Solver to C++. (I suppose
he meant with STL, templates and all). Here is a full answer why I'm
not going to do it:
</p>

<ol class="point">

<li>
The solver is already working in C.
</li>

<li>
The code is not overly object-oriented. Whatever OOP concepts exist there
fit well enough within what C gives me.
</li>

<li>
C++/STL may make it slower, perhaps even considerably. I'd rather not
spend time risking something like that, only to roll it back later.
</li>

<li>
C compiles much faster. (at least with gcc)
</li>

<li>
C is cleaner, more portable and causes less unexpected problems
than C++.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I'm more willing to integrate C++-derived features there into the
C code. Things like namespaces, (non-inherited) classes, or inline
functions. However, for the time being, I'd like to maintain the code as
pure C.
</p>

<p>
For that matter, some of the gcc extensions can prove very useful too, but
I cannot use them either.
