A <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/optimizing-code-for-speed/">new essay about optimising code for speed</a> has been published:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We've all seen the fact that while computers got faster, software has
    often become slower to run unless the hardware is upgraded. <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates%27_Law">The so-called "Gates'
        Law"</a> claims that commercial programs decrease in speed by half
    every 18 months, due to various reasons. It is well known that the various
    versions of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS">DOS</a>
    operating system ran adequately on a PC XT's and 286's and that a Intel 386
    was a "lean and mean DOS machine" as a certain journalist claimed back
    then. On the other hand, Microsoft Windows 3.0 and Microsoft Windows 3.1
    already required a fast 486 computer to be ran comfortably, while Windows
    95 was barely usable there and needed a Pentium computer. Windows XP
    already ran slowly on a Pentium machine and required a high end Pentium III
    or Pentium 4 computer. <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista">Windows Vista</a>
    requires even more hardware resources than Windows XP, up to the point that
    many computers in use today cannot run it comfortably.</p>

    <p>Now, while software simulations that run directly against the CPU and
    memory (and possibly hard-disk) are still running much faster than before,
    the responsiveness of the system itself does not seem to improve much.</p>

<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/W2L/Mini-Intro/">The Mini-Intro
    "Welcome to Linux" lecture</a> was now integrated into the
rest of the site. There are two versions of its slides available: one with a 
point-by-point display (useful for presenting interactively), and the other 
with all the text displayed at once (useful for browsing from the web).

<p>
New Fortune Cookies have been
added to <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">the
    fortune cookie collection</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    R is similar to other programming languages, like C, Java and Perl, in that
    it helps people perform a wide variety of computing tasks by giving them
    access to various commands.
