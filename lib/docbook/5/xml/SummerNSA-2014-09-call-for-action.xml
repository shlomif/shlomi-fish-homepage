            Note however that I’ll be
            accepting of any productions whatsoever of the screenplay,
            including
            by enthusiastic independent film makers, on YouTube,
            and including releasing them as voiced animations.

            The open content / Web 2.0 revolution has proven to be a blazing
            success and a source of decent or better income, esteem,
            and publicity for many individuals, small companies,
            large companies, and other organisations. While during the Web 1.0
            era, information was hard to find, not reliable, and often hard
            to contribute to (what Prof. Lawrence Lessig calls "read only"
            vs. "read/write" in his book

            open source and open content, some
            modern but not unthinkable technology,
            sex/love/romance/relationships, pop culture, and humour, and
            more into what
            was essentially a realism, Real Person Fiction, story featuring
            fictionalised versions of Sarah Michelle Gellar,
            Summer Glau, and General Keith Alexander as themselves. Furthemore,
            I ended up seeing it as my modernisation of
            <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged">Ayn
                Rand’s Atlas Shrugged novel</link> (while still building upon
            it, referencing it and going against it), which was her
            magnus opus as Hacker Monarch.

            Like Atlas Shrugged, “Summerschool at the NSA” was eventually
            understood to be my magnus opus, and I passed the baton to
            someone else, Summer Glau, and thus mostly concluded the
            open content/Web 2.0 revolution with a happy ending.

            One implication of all this is that the worlds of the Academia,

            workers, and those
            of the “content”/culture creators, both the content industry and
            many hobbyists, amateur, independent and/or unsigned artists
            and content producers, who appeared to be mortal enemies at
            a point, will finally become united, for everyone’s benefits.
