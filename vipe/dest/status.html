<h3>Major new features for 0.72 (mostly a bug fix and new syscalls release)</h3>
<ul>
<li> Many new system calls supported, including but not limited to
  exit(1), fork(2), read(3) and write(4).</li>
<li>Fixed bug when evaluating a buffer node and a bug with pattern
  matching on a buffer node.</li>
<li>Fixed bug when matching for a constant [filter_expression {1}] to
  return true, as it should, instead of false, as it did.</li>
<li>Fixed several in-kernel memory leaks and erronous kernel string
  handling.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Major new features for 0.71 (mostly a bug fix and cleanup
release)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
  add a 'get rule count' and 'get rules' API to to the
  sct_ctrl_lib. 'get rule count' will return the number of currently
  registered rules, 'get rules' will return to user space from the
  kernel a linked list of the before and after rules for each system
  call.
  </li>
  <li>
  Support for constants when specifying matching rules, for example,
  O_RDONLY, O_EXCL and friends for open(2).
  </li>
  <li>
  Support for octal/hex numbers in filter expressions.
  </li>
  <li>
  Support for specifying and printing multiplex syscall ids as
  "syscall:func", for example "102:5" for accept(2).
  </li>
  <li>
  Assorted internal cleanups, code refactoring, bug fixes and memory
  leaks plugged, too many to list here. Documentation and header file
  updates. See the ChangeLog for the gory details.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Major new features for 0.7</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Support for dynamic-cast of 'struct' syscall parameters when filtering
  based on them, and for logging. See the relevant section in
  doc/sct_config_manual.html for how to use this feature. Mostly useful now
  for checking struct parameters in socket calls, so now its possible
  to check if a client prorgam tries to connect to a given port or IP address,
  etc.
  </li>
  <li>
  Support for 'fail syscall' actions - allows you to specify that a matching
  syscall invocation will prematurely return a given error code (or '0')
  before the system call is actually performed. Handle with care, as failing
  the wrong syscall invocations might render your system unuseable. Good
  usage example: TODO
  </li>
  <li>
  Support for convenience-macros in rule config files. Currently supported
  macros include:
    <ul>
    <li> ipaddr("127.0.0.1") -&gt; translates an IP address to an unsigned long
                             in network byte-order.
    </li><li> htons(7) -&gt; host to network byte-order for 'short' numbers.
    </li><li> usernametoid("root") -&gt; translates user name to UID.
    </li><li> groupnametoid("wheel") -&gt; translates group name to GID.
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li><li>
  Experimental Device-driver control support - the syscalltrack kernel module
  can now be controlled via a device-file interface - specify "-c device_file"
  when running 'sct_config' to use it. The interface is currently
  functionaly-equivalent to the existing 'sysctl' interface - but it will be
  enhanced in the future to support logging via a device-file interface,
  getting rule list via the device-file interface, etc.
  </li><li>
  Support for 'log_format' definition per rule, to override the global
  'log_format'.
  Initial correctness-testing script added. Currently only runs 2 tests -
  will become more functional on the next release.
  </li><li>
  Support for new system calls - waitpid, close and creat.
</li></ul>
<h3>major bug fixes for version 0.7:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Fixes for white-space parsing in 'sct_config'.
  </li><li>
  Fix small memory leak when deserializing 'log' actions
  </li><li>
  Fix bug in the kernel module that would leave dangling function pointers
  in case a user cleared only the 'before' function pointer. This bug
  wasn't triggered, since sct_config always erased _all_ rules, causing this
  code path to remain yet unused.
</li></ul>
<h3> Major new features for 0.66.6 (mostly a bug-fix version) </h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Support for new process parameters: PPID, PCOMM.
  Special attention should be given to PCOMM, which allows matching
  on the name of the program the process parent is executing.
</li></ul>
<h3>major bug fixes for version 0.66.6:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Fix the bug where filter expression with '!' or '~' weren't parsed correctly.
  </li><li>
  Fix the bug where filter expression first token was a '(' (LPAREN),
  we looped endlessly because we never advanced to the next token.
  thanks to Padraig Brady &lt;padraig @antefacto.com&gt; for triggeting it.
</li></ul>
<h3> Major new features for 0.66 </h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Support for tracking some socket calls (e.g. 'socket', 'listen', 'accept',
  'connect') - yet still without the ability to match against the address
  that a socket connects to.
  </li><li>
  Support for 'after' rules (i.e. rules that are matched right after a syscall
  is invoked, and thus can match and log also the syscall's return value).
  This in addition to the existing 'before' rules (which are matched right
  before entering into the system call). Defining if a rule is a 'before'
  or 'after' rule is done using the 'when' keyword. Also, log formats can be
  specified seperatly for the 'before' rules and for the 'after'
  rules.
  Note: syntax for specifying a 'log_format' in the config file has changed.
        please look at doc/sct_config_manual.txt for details.
  </li><li>
  Support for an 'in' operator in filter expressions (e.g:
  <pre>  filter_expression { PARAMS[1] in ("passwd", "nsswitch.conf") }
  </pre>
  With strings it looks for a substring match. With numbers it looks for
  an exact match.
  </li><li>
  Optimization - variables values are now calculated only when they are used
  (using a callback mechanism) - rather then all values assigned before invoking
  the rule matching engine.
  </li><li>
  Modified the behaviour of unregistering system calls that are 'busy' -
  they are fully unregistered by 'sct_rules.o', so it could be unloaded at will.
  However, 'syscall_hijack.o' unregisters them without yet reducing its module
  use count - it'll do that when the 'busy' syscall invocation(s) return.
  Some syscalls may be blocking for days (e.g. sshd version 1.X blocks on
  'accept' until a client connects to it, which could be days) - and not
  allow unloading 'syscall_hijack.o' - but it won't incur any overhead on
  new system call invocations.
</li></ul>
<h3>major bug fixes for version 0.66:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  Quoted strings in filter expressions could not contain any special
  characters (e.g. dot, equals sign and other operators, brackets, etc).
  now they can, and they may also contain escaped double quotes, e.g.:
  <pre>  "Tom said \"hello there!\""
  </pre>
  </li><li>
  Fix for a potential reference-count breaking problem in
  syscall_hijack.
  </li><li>
   Fixes for potential memory leaks in the rule engine and filters code.
  </li><li>
  The 'tester' stability testing program now only prints real error messages,
  so its output can actually be read.
  </li><li>
  Various other minor bug fixes, as well as various code rewrites, aggregating
  variables into structures, etc.
</li></ul>
<h3> Major new features for 0.64 (mostly a bug-fix version) </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Filter expressions are now fully supported, and are the prefered method
  to define filtering criteria for rules. This includes better error
  messages, and full parameter/variable type checking.
  </li><li> Added support for pointer parameters in system calls, and printing the
  address they contain when logging them.
</li></ul>
<h3>major bug fixes for version 0.64:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unary operators ('~', '!') didn't work at all - now they do.
  </li><li>Fixed a bug in 'sct_config' that could cause crashes, due to a missing
  copy constructor/assigment operator for a struct that was pushed into
  an STL container.
  </li><li>Fixed a potential crasihng bug in filter expressions evaluation in the
  kernel.
  </li><li>Fixed a few potential memory leaks while evaluating filter expressions
  or while failing to get locks in system call stub functions.
</li></ul>
<h3> Major new features for 0.63 </h3>
<ul>
  <li> User defined logging format: it is now possible to define the format
  the log message will take. The default log format is
    syscall: %pid[%comm]: %sid_%sname(%params) (rule %ruleid)
  For example, let us consider an invocation of the 'mkdir' system call:
    syscall: 876[mkdir]: 39_mkdir("foo", 509) (rule 1)
</li><li>Validity checks on system call parameters: sct_config now makes it
  easier to catch rule file erros by making sure that the parameter,
  operand and operator are of matching types. Validity checks are
  implemented for 'param_condition' and 'process_condition' directives
  only.
</li><li>
 Experimental filter expression: sct_config now allows writing clear,
  concise filter expressions. Here's a filter expression to match a
  system call invocation where the user is root (uid 0) and the first
  parameter contains "passwd":
  filter_expression: (UID == 0) &amp;&amp; (PARAMS[1] ~= "passwd")
  (This feature is experimental and does minimal input validation at
  the moment).
</li><li>
  Support for structure parameters: you can now match system calls
  which get a structure as one of their parameters - for example,
  settimeofday(), which gets a 'struct timeval' and 'struct timezone'
  parameters.
</li><li>
Support for (more) process parameters: we now support the following
  process parameters: UID, EUID, SUID, GID, EGID, SGID, PID,
  COMM. Special attention should be given to COMM, which allows matching
  on the name of the program the process is executing.
</li><li>
 Improved sct_config error diagnostics: sct_config now gives clear,
  concise message on configuration file errors, with line numbers for
  easier rule file debugging.
</li><li>
 syscalltrack should compile with the latest 2.2 kernel and every 2.4
  kernel, and has been tested with at least 2.2.19, 2.4.5, 2.4.9,
  2.4.10, 2.4.10-ac11 2.4.12, 2.4.12-ac3 and 2.4.12-um3.
</li><li>
Additional compilation and run time test programs.
</li></ul>
<h3>major bug fixes for version 0.63:</h3>
<ul>
<li> memory leaks in the kernel plugged and eradicated.
</li></ul>
