Regular expressions are one of the most powerful features of Perl, but are
also one of those that beginners find most difficult to understand. Don't let
that fact discourage you: they are definitely worth your time.
</p>

<p>
Basically, a regular expression tells the interpreter to search a string
for a pattern. The pattern can be a simple one like the word "hello" or a
complex one, such as the word "hello" followed by any number of instances of
the word "one", followed by the word "triple". The latter will be
written as <tt>hello(?:one)*triple</tt> inside a regular expression.
</p>

<p>
The perl operators allow you to do three things with a regular expression:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Check if it exists in the string at all.
</li>
<li>
Retrieve various captures out of it.
</li>
<li>
Retrieve all of its occurrences.
</li>
<li>
Substitute the first occurrence or all of its occurrences with some other string
or (perl) expression.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Some perl functions such as <tt>split</tt> and <tt>grep</tt> (which will be
covered later) can utilise regular expressions to do other tasks.
