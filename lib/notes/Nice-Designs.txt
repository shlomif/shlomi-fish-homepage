    - This is nice, but I think it's too dark to be my homepage.
        - not really suitable.

    - This looks nice, but maybe too kitchy.

    - This looks nice, but it's more of a blog than a personal home site.

    - beautiful design, should be adapted.

    - Quite inspiring, but I prefer it to be wider or a liquid
    design.

    - This design is nice and clean. What I dislike about it is:

        1. The fact it doesn't occupy the whole of the page.
            - But I'm hazy about it.

        2. The side bar is ont the right instead of on the left.

    - This is a nice design.
    - side bar is on the right.
    - I need a breadcrumbs' trail instead of the:
        [Home] [News] [Blog] etc.

    - great design
    - Only again, the sidebar should be on the left.
