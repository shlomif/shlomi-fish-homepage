It's been several months since the last update, and there are some new or
updated resources on my homepage.
</p>

<p>
There's 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Spam-for-Everyone/">a new
    funny bit - "'Spam for Everyone' - The International Campaign
    for Accessible Spam"</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    
<p>
Mike "The Mouse" House (a.k.a "D.J. Sallinger") was a minor rap artist, and a
computer geek when he decided to start selling CDs of open-source software. He
turned to spamming to publicise his business, but found out that the spam he
sent was trapped by most spam traps. He decided to use the notorious obscured
image spam, but since he had a few blind friends, decided to also include an
audio recording of a rap song with the spam message.
</p>

<p>
House received a few offers from his spam campaign, but his real break came
when a few enthusiasts of the spam song shared it on the Internet, where it
became an instant hit. The song eventually hit the charts and MTV, and made
D.J. Sallinger famous, who quickly released his first successful album called
"Rap to the spam, Man!", with such highly acclaimed hits as "Rap to not get
trapped" and "He ain't Nigerian. He's a Spammer!".
