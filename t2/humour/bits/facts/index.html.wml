<latemp_subject "Shlomi Fish's Humorous Collections of Facts" />

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
There is an ongoing Internet meme of collecting various funny or otherwise
amusing <a href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com/">"facts" 
about Chuck Norris</a>. This meme has expanded to cover 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Shlomif/Comprehensive_Directory_of_Factoids_Collections">facts
about other people or entities</a>.
</p>

<p>
These pages concentrate my contributions to this trend, which I find very
amusing. Many people I talked with don't enjoy them, as much as I and some
of my friends seem to, so don't worry if you don't.
