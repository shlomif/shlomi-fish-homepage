<p>
It’s a political satire, but one that is universal in its message, and
touches on many aspects of politics, logic and Objectivist philosophy.
</p>

<p>
I originally wrote this story as a way to digest the many things I learned
by reading the <a href="http://www.neo-tech.com/">Neo-Tech</a> material
my father had previously bought. I believe it serves as a pseudo-mathematical
proof that the Hizbullah and similar organizations are as irrational as they
can be.
</p>

<p>
Now it has a sequel in the works: <a href="../RoadToHeaven/">The Road to
Heaven is Paved with Bad Intentions</a>.

the Television show <i>Friends</i></a> - I enjoyed watching <i>Friends</i>
after I graduated from high school, and retrospectively I can say that Joey
was my favourite of the three boys. I believe the character of the ex-Member
of the Organisation drew a lot of inspiration from Friends’ Joey: they are both
naïve and innocent, they both have a positive sense of life, and they both
pretend to be more stupid than they really are.
</p>

<p>
The fact that Joey is a traditional sitcom “stupid-guy” character while the
ex-Member is an ultra-intelligent and ultra-intellectual know-it-all, is
relatively negligible.
