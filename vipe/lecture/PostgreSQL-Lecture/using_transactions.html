<h1>Using Transactions</h1>

<h3>
* A transaction is a batch of statements that is executed at once or can be
cancelled altogether.<br>
<br>
* Use "BEGIN" to start a transaction. After the transaction is done use
"COMMIT" to execute it, or "ROLLBACK" to cancel it.<br>
<Br>
* Example:<br>
<br>
</h3>
<pre>
test=&gt; BEGIN \g
BEGIN
test=&gt; UPDATE employees SET first_name = 'Nahum' WHERE employee_id = 3 \g
UPDATE 1
test=&gt; INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name) 
test=&gt; VALUES (500, 'Linus', 'Torvalds' ) \g
INSERT 18680 1
test=&gt; DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 54 \g
DELETE 1
test=&gt; COMMIT \g
END


</pre>
<h3>

* Changes that are made during the transaction are visible to queries within 
the transaction. Yet, they only become visible to the outside world, after 
the transaction was commited.<br>
