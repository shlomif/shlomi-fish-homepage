<p>
Sometimes it is useful to check for the validation of more than one condition.
For doing this, Perl supplies boolean operators.
</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>
<h2>&amp;&amp;</h2>

<p>
<tt>$x &amp;&amp; $y</tt> evaluates to true if both <tt>$x</tt> and <tt>$y</tt> are true.
It is called the “logical and” of the two operands <tt>$x</tt> and <tt>$y</tt>.
</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h2>||</h2>

<p>
<tt>$x || $y</tt> (called the “logical or” of <tt>$x</tt> and <tt>$y</tt>) is
evaluated to true if one or both of its operands are true.
</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<h2>!</h2>

<p>
<tt>! $x</tt> (pronounced “not <tt>$x</tt>”) evaluates to true
if <tt>$x</tt> is false.
</p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Note that if the first operand is evaluated to false in an
<tt>&amp;&amp;</tt> operation, the second operand will not be evaluated at
all. Similarly, if the first operand of <tt>||</tt> was found to be true,
the second one will not be evaluated either.
</p>

<p>
If you wish both operands to be evaluated at all times you need to assign
them to variables first.

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/conditionals/name_abc.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
Note: The function <tt>lc()</tt> converts a string to lowercase.
