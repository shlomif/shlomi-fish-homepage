Part 1: The Basics
------------------

Intro
    Capabilities of the language: Regexs, OOP, FP, unlimited data structures,
    The perl cycle - write -> run -> debug -> correct -> run
    "There is no king's road to mathematics", Euclid
Output
    The print command.
    Note about semi-colons
Expressions
    Basic operators : +, -, /, *, ( ... ), ., %, **
    Note about using parenthesis with the print function
Strings ( " ... " )
    Basic Escape Sequences - \$ \" \\ \n
    The length() function
    The substr() function
    The int() function
    Note about converting numbers to strings and vice versa (you don't need to!)
Variables
    Introduction to the concept of variables
    A scalar variable can hold anything
    Assigning a value to a variable
        Note about the "+=", "*=", "++" operators
    Getting the value of a variable.
    Note: the dollars are used both for lvalues and rvalues.
    Simple Examples: $a = "Hello world!\n"; print $a,$a,$a;
Input
    The <> operator.
    Examples:
        print "Please enter your name:\n";
        $name = <>;
        print ("Hello " . $name . "!\n");
The For Loop
    The for loop: for $i (1..100)
    Examples:
        Renaming h00.jpg to h000.jpg h01.jpg to h001.jpg etc.
        Printing the multiplication board.
Conditionals:
    if .. elsif .. elsif .. else
    Examples:
        Testing if an inputted name starts with a.
Condition Expressions:
    The numeric comparison operators
    The string comparison operators
    The && and || operators
The While Loop
    Explanation
    Examples:
        ##################################
        print "Input a number:\n";
        $number=<>;
        my $power_of_2 = 1;
        while ($power_of_2 < $number)
        {
            $power_of_2 = ($power_of_2*$power_of_2);
        }
        print ("The first power of 2 that is " .
            "greater than this number is " , $power_of_2, "\n");
        ##################################
Arrays:
    Syntax: @array, $array[$index], scalar(@array).
    The , operator.
    foreach
        Note about the fact that the for and foreach keywords are equivalent
        Note about the .. operator (without too much explanation)
    Examples:

    Some syntax:
        \ - takes a reference to an existing variable or a scalar value
        [ ] - a dynamic refernece to an array.
            Note about copying an array reference with [ @_ ];
        { } - a dynamic reference to a hash.

Part 3: Modules and Objects
---------------------------

Introduction
    Modular Perl Programming
        What are References to Functions and why they are important.
            Closures and their usefulness
        Modules and their importance
        Objects and their importance
    A note about the fact that there is more than one file
References to functions
    Taking the reference of a function - \&mysub
    Calling a function from its reference - &{$ref}(...) or $ref->( ... )
    Dynamic References to functions - sub { ... }
    Behaviour of functions inside functions (lexical scoping)
        Demonstrate the dispatch function
Modules
    Specifying a namespace with the package directive
        The :: as a namespace separator
        Where to find a module
    importing modules - use My::Module;
    Accessing functions from a different module - My::Module::func().
    Exporting Variables
        use Exporter;
        @EXPORT
        @EXPORT_OK
    Importing variables - use vars qw(...); and $My::Module::var.
        Why "my" won't work.
    BEGIN and END - global constructor and destructor for the package.
    Note: The main namespace.
Objects
    Intro: what are objects and how they are used
    Intro 2: how it works behind the scenes
        The object is a reference to a hash
        Its members are the hash elements
        The reference is "blessed" to be associated with a module
        That module contain the methods of the object's class
        When a method name is called with $obj->method() it is searched
            for starting at a module class.
        Note: in perl, passing the reference to the object is done
            explicitily and it is the first argument of a method.
    Object use: (demonstrate on Data::Dumper, CGI)
        Initializing a new object
        Accessing class members using $obj->{'member'}
        Calling methods of an object using $obj->method( @args)
    Making your own objects:
        The constructor:
#############
        sub new
        {
            my $class = shift;
            my $self = {};
            bless $self, $class;

            $self->initialize();

            return $self;
        }
############
            Explanation
                Since calling is CGI->new() then CGI is the first argument to
                    to function
                bless
                After the blessing is done one can call methods on it.
            Note: its name need not be "new"
        Methods:
##############
            sub add_elems
            {
                my $self = shift;

                foreach my $elem (@_)
                {
                    $self->{'sum'} += $elem;
                    $self->{'sum_squares'} += $elem**2;
                    $self->{'N'}++;
                }
            }
###############
    Object Inheritance:
        The use vars qw(@ISA); @ISA=qw(My::Class Parent); scheme
        Calling methods from base classes
        	The SUPER directive ($self->SUPER::hello());
    Destructors
        The DESTROY method
    isa() and can()

Part 4: CPAN, sprintf, system functions, excpetions
---------------------------------------------------

* Installing and Using CPAN Modules
* sprintf
* Alternate forms for writing strings.
    - q{} qq{}, etc.
    - Here Documents - <<EOF.
* Executing Other Processes:
    - system
    - `command`
    - open "|hello";
    - open "cat hello | "
* More about behaviour of || and &&
    - For sort: $a->{'name'} cmp $b->{'name'} || $a->{'address'} cmp $b->{'address'}
    - The "and" and "or" operators
* Exceptions:
    - die
    - eval
    - The Carp module (carp, croak)
    - The Error.pm module on CPAN
* Some more system functions
    - opendir/readdir and friends
    - seek/tell
    - -X (-e, -f and friends)
    - chdir
    - mkdir
    - stat

Part 5: Good Programming Practices:
-----------------------------------

* Testing:
    - Motivation for testing.
        - Your code is probably not bug free from the start.
        - A contract for your code.
            - As a complement to documentation
        - Makes sure refactoring and enhancement do not introduce
        regressions.
    - Demo:
        - Download the skeleton.
        - Write tests using Test::More.
        - Type "./Build test".
    - Unit tests vs. Integration tests vs. System Tests.
    - Mocking.
        - Demo
    - Data-driven testing.
        - The older XP method of putting in HTML
            - Ask Ran Eilam about it.
        - Test::Base
* Version Control
    - Motivation:
        - Not lose your code by accident.
        - Keep historical version of your code, for easy reverting.
        - Maintain several simultaneous lines of your code.
        - More convenient than patches+tarballs.
    - Demonstrate Subversion a bit and refer to a good tutorial (perhaps
    "Bottom-Up Subversion")
* Class Accessors
    - Motivation
        - So you can later have control on setting and accessing a property.
            - In case it turns out to be calculated.
        - Because hash values can be mis-spelled.
    - Example for a simple accessor.
    - Accesor modules on CPAN:
        - Class::Accessor
        - Spiffy
            - not discussed.
            - Warning: lots of magic.
        - Moose.
        - Others:
            - Should mention some in passing.
            - Class::MethodMaker
            - Class::Methodist
* Plugins, multi-inheritance, traits, etc.
    - NEXT -> MRO::Compat/mro.
* Some Niceties in Advanced versions of Perl:
    - use base instead of @ISA
    - Lexical Filehandles.
* local
    - Its judicious use and abuse.
    - Refer to "Coping with Scoping", MJD's Local article,
    my Linux-IL post
* Documentation - POD
    - Demonstrate POD.
        - Refer to perldoc perlpod.
    - Literate Programming.
        - Why I'm not using it. (yet)
        - DocBook/XML
    - Extensions:
        - Pod::PseudoPod
        - MOD by Mark Jason Dominus.
        - Perldoc.pm on CPAN by Ingy.
* IO::Handle:
    - IO::File
    - IO::Dir
    - IO::Socket
    - IO::All
* Tying it all together - Module-Starter and Module-Build.
    - The module-starter invocation command.
        - arguments
        - Generate MyMath::Ops
    - What to do after we have the module.
        - perl Build.PL
        - ./Build
        - ./Build test
        - ./Build disttest.
        - ./Build dist
    - Add a meaningful MyMath::Ops::Add module.
        - Test first.
    - Get rid of the failures in t/boilerplate.t.
