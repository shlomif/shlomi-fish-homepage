<p>
Perl provides several file tests that can be used to test a filehandle
or filename for various conditions. <tt>-e filename</tt> determines if
<tt>filename</tt> exists. <tt>-r</tt> determines if the file is readable,
<tt>-w</tt> if it's writeable, <tt>-x</tt> if it is executable and so on.
</p>

<p>
<tt>-d</tt> determines if the file is a directory, and <tt>-f</tt> if it's
a plain file. For a list of other file tests and their use consult
<tt>perldoc -f -X</tt>.
