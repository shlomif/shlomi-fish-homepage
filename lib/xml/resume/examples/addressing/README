This directory contains a set of minimal documents for testing the
address handling code.  Each test can be built by passing the RESUME
variable to make, for example:

make RESUME=italy

will build italy.html, italy.txt and italy.pdf from the source file italy.xml.

If you add additional XML test files to this directory, please be sure to
set the <filename>_format variable in the Makefile accordingly.
