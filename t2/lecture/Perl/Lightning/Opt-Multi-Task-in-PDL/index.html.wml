<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This is a presentation about how to implement a certain Game AI
multi-tasking optimisation problem in <a href="http://pdl.perl.org/">PDL</a>
(the Perl Data Language), thus gaining both speed and flexibility.

<p>
I have now made a derivative version of code discussed here available as
<cpan_dist d="AI-Pathfinding-OptimizeMultiple">CPAN package called
“AI-Pathfinding-OptimizeMultiple”</cpan_dist>. Strangely enough, other
people and I were not able to find prior art for this algorithm and technique
in the Game Artificial Intelligence literature.
