Smart Link Ltd.<br />
Programmer and Tester

<p>
Testing a software-based modem (Modio), Windows 95 Programming. Manual testing
of a soft-modem. Writing test procedures.  Programming various utilities in 
Visual C++, MFC, and Perl.
</p>

<detailed>
<p>
I began working at SmartLink as a tester for their software-based modem
which was based on a soundcard and implemented the connection logic and the DSP
in software. I worked with Windows 95 and Windows 95 OSR2. When Smart-Link hired
a dedicated and more experienced Q&amp;A Engineer, I became a part-time tester/
high-level programmer/general jack-of-all-trades.
</p>
<p>
I worked with the Windows Drivers, MFC, Perl for Win32, DJGPP, Cygwin, a myriad
of games and modem-related software, as well as Microsoft IIS.

I worked at Cortext as a web-designer and CGI programmer. I worked with HTML,

Perl due to my limited knowledge (at that point) of UNIX.

</p>
</undetailed>

<detailed>

<p>
Elpas developed a network of sensors that was installed in each room of a
building (say a hospital), and received input from infra-red badges.  That made
it possible to determine where each person or piece of equipment was located. I
maintained the software that ran on a centralised computer, received the raw
input from the sensors and processed it. My main issue was to replace an SCO
UNIX server software with something internal of our own. We inspected working
with Microsoft Access and ODBC, and eventually realised our own in-memory data
managing was the most suitable solution due to the real-time nature of the
application.
</p>

<p>
Specialised in Windows (16-bit) Programming, SQL, ODBC, ANSI C and C++. Worked
primarily with Borland C++ 4.5 and the Microsoft Developer Network.
