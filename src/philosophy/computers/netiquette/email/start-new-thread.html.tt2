<p>
You should not reply to an existing message in order to start a new thread,
which will also involve changing the E-mail <code>Subject:</code> line and deleting
the existing quoted body. That's because standard-compliant threaded mail
user agents (MUAs) will respect the <b>In-Reply-To:</b> headers and display
the message as a reply to the one to which you replied.
</p>

<p>
The proper way to start a new thread is to:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Press the compose a new message button.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Fill in the mailing listâ€™s E-mail address (you should have auto-completion
and/or an address book).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Fill in the subject line and the body.
</p>
</li>

</ol>
