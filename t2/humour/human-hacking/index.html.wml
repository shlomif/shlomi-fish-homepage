<p>
An unlikely female computer <a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">hacker</a> (=
software enthusiast, not a computer intruder)-wannabe is getting taught by an
even more unlikely female computer hacker. It takes place in Los Angeles,
California and is written in English.

<b>Update:</b> (12 April, 2011) there’s now a new
<a href="#version_2">version 2</a> of the story with some improvements to
the plot and style, and it’s now written using version 5 of DocBook/XML. I’m
planning some smaller future improvements, but it should be OK as it is.

in my story, and provided some inspiration for it. There is a lot of

the direction this spin-off / remix had initially taken but you may still like
it.

If you enjoyed the story, but still think you can do better, I would love to
see more spin-offs, from making the story a little different, to writing
sequels, prequels, etc. to video or audio versions of it. If you find
the CC-by-sa too permissive or too restrictive to license the derivative
work under, then <a href="$(ROOT)/me/contact-me/">drop me
a line</a> and we may be able to negotiate a better, commercial, licence.
