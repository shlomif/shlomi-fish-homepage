<latemp_subject "The Pope Died on Sunday" />

<p>
A hectic week in the life of an American female graphic artist called Rachel
Southern. A typical Hollywood story with some uncommon elements.
This story (a novella) was originally written in Hebrew and is still
incomplete, with an ongoing translation to English by the author (translations
to other languages will be appreciated.).
</p>

<p>
This story is work in progress, so stay tuned and I’ll write it as time goes
by. You can contact me on <a href="$(ROOT)/me/contact-me/">my contact page</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note for 3-April-2005:</b> This story is unrelated to the recent
death of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II">Pope John
Paul II</a>. I wrote most of what you can find here several years ago
. Here’s <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/676">my
first announcement of its writing</a>. It’s not finished yet.
