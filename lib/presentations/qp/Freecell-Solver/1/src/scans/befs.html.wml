Best-First Search is a type of scan that:
<ol>
<li>
Gives priority to each state based on some weight function.
</li>

<li>
Determines which state to go to next, according to their highest
priority.
</li>
</ol>

<li>
I implemented Best-First Search whose weight function was a linear
combination of several weighting functions I thought about.

<li>
It turned out that for most boards, I could find some relative 
weights that could solve it very quickly, but no configuration
was good for any board.
