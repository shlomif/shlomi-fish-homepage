This is the first in a series of essays about common fallacy patterns in the
computer world. The first is what I call the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window">Broken Window Fallacy</a> of computers. As
you may know in the broken window fallacy, one says that if something is
damaged then it generates more revenue to the economy, because one will have
to fix the damage. However, as is demonstrated in the article, it might as
well been done differently.
</p>

<p>
I talked with a few people on IRC about how I hated the fact that most people
are still using Windows which is quickly getting infected with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware">malware</a>, or
<a href="[% base_path %]no-ie/">Internet Explorer</a>, which
is lagging behind Firefox and other browsers in its support for web standards,
and makes the job of the web designer much harder. So they told me that it is
actually a good thing because that way someone has to fight the malware (a
very uphill battle), and they have more work as web developers.
</p>

<p>
In a podcast Interview with him
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/AboutMe.html">Joel Spolsky</a> said
that Open Source Software will reduce the demand for programmers, because they
make some tasks easier. And so programmers are happier, but they have to
work less. He missed the point that a lot of proprietary software also does
that, because it costs a fraction of the cost it would take to develop all
this functionality from scratch. But that's not the main thing that is wrong
in this argument.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that tech workers can never run out of things to do. In the
time they have to adapt their web-sites for MSIE, they can better spend on
things like having better functionality, more web-sites, more pages. The time
people spend making sure their Windows systems are free of malware, is better
spent happpily using Linux and getting some actual, productive work done.
</p>

<p>
So Windows and MSIE are a huge strain on society. I can never run out of
things to do. At the moment, I have an idea for a commercial site, several
essays I'm working on, tons of ideas for other essays, open source software
to write, and lots of external open-source projects that would love to have
me as a contributor. Trying to adapt my sites to broken proprietary software
only slows me down. It also slows you down if you're a developer.
</p>

<p>
So don't fall into the "broken window" fallacy. Encourage everyone around
you to switch away from MSIE and Windows.
