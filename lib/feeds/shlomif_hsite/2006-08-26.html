<!-- TITLE=“Case for File Swapping”, “Fortunes Mania” + Site Building Instructions-->
<p>
There’s a
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/case-for-file-swapping/">new
    revision of “The Case for File Swapping”</a>. Moreover, I
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/ideas/fortunes-mania/">wrote
    a page with my idea for “Fortunes Mania”</a> - a community site for managing
    fortunes cookies and quotes.
</p>

<p>
There are now
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/site-source/">comprehensive
    instructions for building the site</a>. If you have some spare time,
please try to run them to see if you are successful in building it.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I added two new FAQ questions:
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/#idf_service">“Did
    you serve in the Israeli Military?”</a> and
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/#favourite_music">“What is
    your Favourite Music?”</a>
