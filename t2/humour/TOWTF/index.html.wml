<latemp_subject "The One with the Fountainhead" />

<p>
This is a parody about Ayn Rand's novel, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead">"The 
Fountainhead"</a>, modelled around a two part episode of "Friends". 

<p>
A friend of mine who read the book, but didn't watch "Friends" found this
piece highly entertaining. Moreover, an English lady I've been talking with
online, who likes Friends and hasn't read the book yet, also liked reading
this creation of mine. So it is probably good enough for people who are 
familiar with only one of the two sources of inspiration.
</p>

<p>
I consider this piece my funniest yet.
