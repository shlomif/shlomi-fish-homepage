[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "Padme" title = "Queen Padmé Amidala" %]

<p>
The character of Padmé is inspired by several people:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala">The original Padmé</a> from
Star Wars as portrayed by Natalie Portman.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://www.tiffanyalvord.com/">Tiffany Alvord</a>, whom Padmé
self-referentially knows plays her.
</p>
</li>

<li>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> and
my perception of other members of the British royalty. ( Padmé’s aunt, Elizabeth
"Liz" Amidala is named so in her honour. )
</p>

<p>
Naboo has other similarities with Britain, like the fact that most jedis
do not usually carry blasters. This is similar to the fact that most British
policemen do not carry fire arms.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
Like me, Shlomi Fish, Padmé has software development know-how,
and maintains a site with a <a href="[% base_path %]meta/FAQ/">FAQ</a>.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, like Alvord, me, and many other WWW publishers (aka "bloggers")
</p>

<p>
While I imagined Vader being dressed in his iconic and memorable
robot-like suit, I imagined him speaking normally. That is without
the heavy breathing.

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "Yoda" title = "Yoda" %]

<p>
The character of Yoda incorporates influences from these characters;
</p>

</p>
</li>

<p>
<a href="https://spaceballs.fandom.com/wiki/Yogurt">Spaceballs’ Yogurt</a>
</p>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://kungfupanda.fandom.com/wiki/Oogway">Master Oogway from the “Kung Fu Panda” universe</a>
