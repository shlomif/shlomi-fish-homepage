[ Television News Station ]

News Anchor: This night, Shlomi Fish’s bedroom in his apartment in
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/multiverse-cosmology/#ramatavivgimel">Ramat Aviv Gimel, Tel Aviv</a> was detonated taking Fish’s life. Tiffany Alvord, who is a singer, musician, song-writer, actress, and creator, and whom Fish has featured in some of his recent fan-fiction works, and admitted to have been infatuated with, has claimed responsibility for that bombing.

+++: Ms. Alvord published a blog post criticising the fact that Fish has admitted to liking or even loving many entities <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/">on his FAQ</a>. Moreover, she recorded and uploaded a video:

Tiffany Alvord: I cannot see how Shlomi can be a good boyfriend while having
so many polyamorous love recipients. If I cannot have 100% of his time, soul,
mind, love, and knowledge [ <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/multiverse-cosmology/#the-game">Reference: TheGame™ of Fantastecha™</a> ] … then no one can have him at all!

Tiffany Alvord: muah hah hah hah… [Devilish sound+visual effects.]

Screen become noisy, like an old-school / analogue television, and then
<a href="https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Sam_the_Eagle">Sam the Eagle</a>
(Muppets) is shown holding some paper pages.

Sam: Greetings all observers! We have found Ms. Alvord’s expectations to
be incompatible with the implementation of these concepts in Fantastatecha,
common logic, reason, and mathematical knowledge. Moreover, her retaliated
assassination attempt violates common Multiversal and Universal ethics,
as well as the ethical and moral codes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel">the modern State of Israel</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gush_Dan">Gush Dan</a>, and <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/multiverse-cosmology/#ramatavivgimel">Ramat Aviv Gimel</a>.

[ Sam thinks for a moment about what he just said, and then forward-scans and back-scans his paper sheets. ]

Sam: who wrote this speech?!

Sam: anyway, to elaborate, it is unreasonable for a Fantastechan entity to receive a flat 100% of a Fantastechan hacker or similar’s soul, mind, love, or knowledge, given they often think of themselves or other 3rd-party entities.

Sam: Moreover, there is an expectation that a Fantastechan entity which has a mind and a soul, will not the soul, the mind, or their union.

Sam: as a result, the Foundation For Fantastecha™n Functional Fidelity (= or
“quintuple-F”) has intervened and rewrote the plot.
