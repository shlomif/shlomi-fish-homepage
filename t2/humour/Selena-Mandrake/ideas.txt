* The Master
    - "Call me 'Karl'".
    - "I always thought the Master would be Karl the Great"
    - "You're Charlemagne, admit it."
    - "Idiot, you've discovered my identity and I shall now parish. Selena

    - his soul leaves his body and gives his body.
    - Selena touches his corpse with her foot and the body evaporates into
    dust.
        - The crowd cheers.

* "You now must slay The Rider, the Vampirella with the oldest body ; the
Integrator, the Vampire with the same body and same soul ; and The Slayer,
the first vampire to have slain."

* "Only a Vampire can slay a vampire, and vampirellas are the most formidable
slayers."

* "Tell you what - I'm no longer The Slayer. I quit"
    - The Guide: "As you wish."
    - A crazy looking woman heads into their direction with a knife in her
    hands.
        - Selena freaks out and hides behind the Guide.
        - The Guide pulls out a cross bow and shoots the woman in her heart
        and she evaporates into dust.
    - "That was the Slayer"
    - "Selena: so you slew her?"
    - "The Guide: no, you did."

* The Guide gives Selena a gift in a fancy chest. The first compartment contains
a very stylised 1d10 die, and after opening the other compartment, she sees
a plastic card saying "Vampire" on the side, with her ID photo, and saying:
«Selena Mandrake ; "buffy" ; The Dispeller» on the other side.

* The two British vampires.
    - Selena is doing her maths homework at the library.
    - "I'm Alan. I'm John. We're Mighty Vampires."
        - "Selena Mandrake. Mighty Pirate.".
    - The start talking about various pop culture stuff and funny things.
    - end up emulating the suicide squad from "Life of Brian".
        - with unsharpened pencils.
        - "Selena Mandrake - we have been slain by you.".
