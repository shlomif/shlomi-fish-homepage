<h1 class="fcs">1.2 Whence for?</h1>

<p>
So far we have learned about three different kinds of for loops, so
you are probably wondering when to use each one. 
</p>

<p>
A subtantial difference between the notation 
<tt>for($a=0 ; $a&lt;$b ; $a++)</tt> and between 
<tt>for $a (0 .. ($b-1))</tt> is that the first accommodates 
itself to changes in <tt>$b</tt>, while the second will iterate for a
constant number of times. Of course, you can make the first one 
similar to the second by assigning the value of <tt>$b</tt> to a third
variable that will remain constant. Still, the second notation is
usually safer from that sense.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>foreach $item (@array) </tt> loop is quite handy, but sometimes 
when iterating over an array of items the index of the item is of importance.
In that case, one may prefer to use a normal <tt>for</tt> loop.
