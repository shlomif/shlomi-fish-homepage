* Style the section navigation menus better.

* Put more meaningful descriptions in the place holders for all the
presentations.

* Add a nice news items summary news box at the top with the site news. 
  Also create an RSS feed for them.

* Make sure the pages of the relevant categories that are not in the
navigation menu are expanded into the breadcrumbs trail.

* Fix the link to the /-URL bug that causes links to seem unavailable.

* Link the Hebrew Errors Page to the main one.

* Add my Wikipedia contributions into the "Contributions to FOSS projects".


* Expand the Google Sitemap with all the pages in the navigation menu (or
  other navigation menus) - ?:
    - http://search.cpan.org/~jasonk/WWW-Google-SiteMap-0.03/lib/WWW/Google/SiteMap.pm
    - http://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/docs/en/protocol.html

* Add Recommendations:
    - Movies
    - Audio CDs
    - Books
        - The Penguin Book of Curious and Interesting Puzzles.

* Add a nav-menu to the Puzzles section.

* Fortunes:
    - Make sure the *.tar.gz are installed by the makefile without help
    from gen-helpers.pl.

* Revamp http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/ - instead of a list of
projects, show a list of categories.

* To add:
    - Park-Lisp to the site under Software.
    - "The Case for Drug Legalisation"
    - Followup to the wiki article.
    - Followup to Bash Themes.
    - Update of "FOSS and Other Beasts"
    - Update of "The Case for File Swapping"

Minor Problems:
---------------

* Fix the fact that the "Private Tutor HTML Ad" goes beyond the right 
margins.

* Go over the pages of the individual presentations and add meaningful 
descriptions.
    - link to the new presentation in "Linux for the Technion student".

* Puzzles
    - Solve the "On the tip of the sword" puzzle.
    - Explain the solution of the other puzzles.

Long Term:
----------

* Add more essays I wrote to the Essays Index.

* Revamp the Math-Ventures site and re-write the formulae in TeX, MathML 
etc.
