In later versions of Freecell Solver, each state contains a pointer to 
its "parent state" - the first state from which it was discovered.

I eventually realized I could add a move stack of moves that lead from
the parent to it, thus enabling FCS to trace the solution of a state
by collecting all the moves to the initial state.

This resulted in shorter solutions, making the optimization scan almost
completely unnecessary.
