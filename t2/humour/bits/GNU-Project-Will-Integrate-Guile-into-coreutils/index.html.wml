<b>Tel Aviv, Israel:</b> the GNU (= “Guile N' UNIX”) project announced today
that following the popular decision to integrate GNU Guile (= an implementation
of the Scheme programming language) into GNU Make, it is going to integrate
GNU Guile into the various tools inside GNU coreutils. So for example, GNU
cat will have a "-g" flag that will allow embedding Scheme expressions, GNU
echo will gain a similar flag, and GNU true and GNU false will allow evaluating
Scheme expressions for truth or falsehood. It is not yet clear what
functionality GNU head and GNU tail will gain by the integration.

O’Reilly Media announced that it will publish a new edition of its
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Mastering-Cat/">series of
books</a>, which includes <i>Mastering cat</i> and <i>Mastering echo</i> to
cover the additional functionality provided by GNU Guile, and we will give
an overview of the additional functionality in
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/New-Israeli-Tech-Usergroups/">the
usergroups</a> of the cat mongers, the echo-chamberists, and the (GNU) true
believers.

“If it’s not bloat, it’s not us.”, said Richard Stallman, the colourful
head of the GNU project, and started to sing the Free Software song. Linus
Torvalds was not available for comments about the proposal to integrate
GNU Guile into the Linux kernel.
