<p>
This is a button I made for use with sites created using the
<a href="http://web-cpan.shlomifish.org/latemp/">Latemp</a> content-management
system. It was created using <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>,
a cross-platform vector-graphics package (which I ran on Linux).
</p>

<p>
The design is really simple - a big Latemp logo with the font Crilee, with
a nice gradient within a white background and a text saying “Made With” of a
Sans-Serif font on a blue background on top.
</p>

<p>
I had to use a sans-serif font for the top inscription, because the serif
fonts I tried did not scale well to small resolutions, which were needed by
a decently sized button.
</p>

<p>
One task that required some effort were the rounded corners. To have them
I needed to merge (Inkscape’s Path Union operation) a rounded-corner
rectangle, with a shorter (but equally as wide) rectangle positioned at the
bottom.
</p>

<p>
I’m pretty happy with the results, even though it did not require too much
effort.
