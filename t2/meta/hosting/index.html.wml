<h2 id="hostgator">Hostgator</h2>

<p>
www.shlomifish.org and related sites are hosted at
<a href="http://www.hostgator.com/"><b>HostGator</b></a>. HostGator’s hosting is
affordable, has unlimited disk space, practically no downtime, and very
prompt and helpful tech support. The downsides are that some of the software
on the shared hosting is not too up-to-date (which does not bother me too
much because my sites are mostly static), and that the panel interface (cPanel
I believe) is quite confusing. But otherwise, I'm very happy.

<p>
shlomifish.org used to be hosted at
<a href="http://heptagon.co.il/"><b>Heptagon Software</b></a>
(formerly known as Eonspace), but I moved away due to frequent and lengthy
downtimes.

server hosting</a> for example - then have a look at our long term buddies:
