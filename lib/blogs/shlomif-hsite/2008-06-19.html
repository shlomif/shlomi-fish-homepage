The highlight of today’s news item is that there’s 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/closed-books-are-so-19th-century/">a new essay titled 
    <b>“Why Closed Books are So 19th Century?”</b></a>:
</p>

<blockquote>

    <p> And despite all that, we can often see that books are getting published
    on paper, and either completely not available online, or their free
    re-distribution is restricted. They are often available on Peer-to-Peer
    networks or illegally, but their use is still restricted, and complicates
    things.  </p>

    <p>
    In this article, I’d like to note why non-open books (or at least books
    that are not available online) are as pointless as <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/foss-other-beasts/">non-open-source 
        software</a>.  
    </p>

</blockquote>

<p>
The other changes are more minor:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Improvements to the <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/art/recommendations/music/">Recommended 
        music page</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
    Added 
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/conf/vim/">my
        Vim configuration files</a> to the site.
    </li>
    <li>
    There’s a 
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/shlomif.html#monty-python-on-computer-interfaces">new 
        fortune cookie</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
Enjoy!
