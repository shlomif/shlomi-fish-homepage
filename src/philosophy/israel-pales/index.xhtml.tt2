<h2>Discussion and Errata</h2>

<p>
See <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/philosophy-il/message/128">some
discussion about this article</a> in the Philosophy-IL mailing list. One thing
that was brought there, which I agree with, is that the measures are given as
an end in themselves, rather than as means to an end. In the essay, I tried to
outline why they were a logical consequence of the ethical principles I
mentioned, but it may not be an adequate replacement for this.
