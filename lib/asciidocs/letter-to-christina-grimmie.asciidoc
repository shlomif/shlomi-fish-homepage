The letter
----------

Dear Christina,

**Executive Summary**: I have always loved you, I always will, I think you rock (and you are my candidate for being the next most-awesome-individual-ever). Moreover, I admit that I believe you are https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/indiv-nodes/meaning-of-able-competent.xhtml[more "able"] than I. I need you, I wish you were here, and I strongly suspect you are really still alive, healthy, and kicking.

I may have been overzealous in my tweeting ( https://twitter.com/shlomif/with_replies )
and my "blogging" / web publishing ( https://www.shlomifish.org/art/recommendations/music/online-artists/fan-pages/christina-grimmie/ )
so I apologise for that.

It is a shot in the dark, but if you're alive, please make it public knowledge. I
had a 'Simba is Alive'-like moment ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjYGB4uYgWw )
with respect to you (and later to everyone else who reportedly died).

I care about you and am even willing for my soul to perish, if it implies the
1994-born Christina Victoria Grimmie ("World's biggest loser") is alive, conscious,
healthy, and happy somewhere in the multiverse of imagination.
