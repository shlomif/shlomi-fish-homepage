11 Auto-confisication and Friends

<h3 class="notbold">
<ul>
<li>
Once upon a time, Freecell Solver was distributed only with a makefile
for GNU make, and everyone were happy.
</li>
<li>
When Stephan Kulow embedded its code into kpat, he adapted the makefile
to use the standard KDE Autoconf-based build process.
</li>
<li>
Somewhat afterwards, I decided that I want the build process to be more
portable and modular, and to give users the ability to build a shared
library.
</li>
<li>
The solution - converting to Autoconf, Automake and Libtool.
</li>
<li>
How to do that exactly is out of the scope of this lecture. I can just say
that it is not very straightforward, and that it required a lot of tweaking
and trial and error.
</li>
<li>
I then decided that having an RPM of Freecell Solver would be nice. So I created
an RPM spec for it.
</li>
<li>
Again, it required quite a lot of tweaking and experimenting.
(<a href="http://linuxclub.il.eu.org/lectures/31/">Tzafrir Cohen's Lecture</a>
and various web-resources were a great help)
</li>
<li>
I eventually integrated generating an up-to-date RPM SPEC into the Autoconf
process, and thus, was able to build an RPM by issuing a constant sequence of
commands.
</li>
<li>
A corresponding Debian package has been initially created by Yotam Rubin and
is now maintained by Risko Gergely, who also uploads it to the Debian pool
of packages.
