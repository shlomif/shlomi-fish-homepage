<!-- TITLE=New Humour Pages and Additions-->
<p>
The 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/" rel="nofollow">page
    with my own Chuck Norris facts</a> has accumulated some newer facts:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>

<li>
Deletionists delete Wikipedia articles. Chuck Norris deletes deletionists
who delete Wikipedia articles.
</li>

<li>
Chuck Norris reads all messages posted to LKML (= the Linux Kernel
Mailing List), understands them all, and he kills all gnomes he
sees in sight.
</li>

</ul>

</blockquote>

<p>
There's also <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Xena/" rel="nofollow">a
new page with an ongoing collection of facts about Xena, the Warrior 
Princess</a>, who is, for a change, a female target of exaggerated factoids.
</p>

<blockquote>

<ul>

<li>
Xena can meet King David for breakfast and Julius Caesar for lunch. Without
time travel.
</li>

<li>
No one calls Xena the warrior princess "Zeena" to her face and survives. Lucky
for you she hasn't visited modern-day U.S. yet.
</li>

</ul>

<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Blue-Rabbit-Log/" rel="nofollow">The Blue Rabbit
Log</a> is an old screenplay I began writing that is still under construction.
It aims to be a crazy comedy about Fantasy Role Playing Games:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Galku:</strong> Yes, it is my specialty to neutralise
such characters who prevent raising your ambitious evil projects.  </p>
<p><strong>Mordox:</strong> What did you say?  </p>

<p><strong>Galku:</strong> I said I get rid of such characters
who prevent raising your evil projects.  </p> <p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> You said my projects are evil? How dare you! My
projects are in no way evil. They are just incredibly selfish and totally
inconsiderate of everybody else's interests and welfare.  </p>

<p><strong>Galku:</strong> I couldn't define evil better myself.
</p> <p><strong>Mordox:</strong> Did I get you here to write a
dictionary of the English language?  </p>

<p><strong>Galku:</strong> No, but as a matter of fact I am
writing one myself, as a hobby. The last word I wrote the definition for was
"evidently", and I think the next word will be...  </p> <p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> Cut it out! Now, where were we?  </p>

<p><strong>Galku:</strong> I just said it is my specialty to get
rid of characters who prevent raising your incredibly selfish and totally
inconsiderate of everybody else's interests and welfare projects.  </p>

<p>
I've started writing 
a <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/conclusions/" rel="nofollow">conclusions
and reviews page for my story "The Human Hacking Field Guide"</a>
</p>

<p>
There are new English and Hebrew revisions of 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/" rel="nofollow">my story - "The Enemy
and How I Helped to Fight it"</a> with many corrections. Furthermore, the
source files have been converted to XHTML instead of OpenOffice.org. 
</p>

<p>
There is 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/ongoing-text.html#meet-Q-Gadol" rel="nofollow">a 
new scene in "Star Trek: We, the Living Dead" called "Meet Q Gadol"</a>.
</p>

<p>
I added <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/#computers-specs" rel="nofollow">an 
    F.A.Q. question and answer about "What are your computers'
    specifications</a>.
