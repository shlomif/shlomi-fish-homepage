    What happens when you combine Star Wars (and its even better Spaceballs parody),
    Star Trek, slashdot.org's darling Israeli-American moviemaker Natalie Portman,
    some Jewish/Israeli/"Zionist"/antisemite conspiracy theories, hacking,
    open source / open content / free / geek / "share" culture, some geeky and sexy (but we
    repeat ourselves) female and male action heroes, mashed together
    with love and a Tel Aviv secular Jewish Tanakh / Ancient Near East Chutzpah?
    <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Queen-Padme-Tales/">Queen Padmé Tales</a>,
    the 2nd-most-crazy television series in history where Natalie is destined to
    direct or co-direct the popular YouTuber pop music artist Tiffany Alvord
    (who has traditionally entertained the shy, recessive, "good girl" image)
    as the new Queen Padmé Amidala of the Naboo, within my
    <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse">imaginary crossover world</a>
    and Portman as her aunt, Archduchess Elizabeth Amidala.
