            <p>A Jewish Deduction</p>

            <p>
The Bible dictates that "Thou shalt not seethe [= cook] a kid [= young goat]
in his mother's milk." To avoid any possibility of breaking that regulation, 
the Jewish tradition ruled that it also applies to female goats, to mature
goats, and to the meat and milk of two completely unrelated goats. It is 
also forbidden to eat the meat with fresh milk, and it applies to beef 
and mutten as well (including mixing the milk and meat of two different
beasts). Finally, chicken, which are incapable of milk production, may not
be eaten along with any mammal's milk either. 
</p>

<p>
We are fortunate that most mathematicians were not Jewish. Otherwise, it
would have been forbidden to divide by all numbers between -1 and 1.

Sure I did. I sat at one point of an IRC channel, and someone
tested me. Eventually it was discovered that I am a computer, but it
turned out the other side was an Eliza program. Strangely enough, I could
not detect that the latter fact was true.

Judging by IRC or AOL, randomly would do just fine ;-)

            And thank you for applying this patch. But to be honest, I'm a little
disappointed. I expected it won't go in so easily and will trigger some
discussion here. But there was none. No typo corrections ("you mis-spelled
'floccinaucinihilipilification'"); no flames ("this patch is the worst
thing since non-sliced bread"). Nothing.</p>

<p>
Someone should do something about it. This direction is not healthy for
p5p. Seriously.</p>

Are you kidding?

CVS is not advanced as:

1. Microsoft Visual SourceSafe - the only sane choice for good data integrity 
and portability.

2. tarballs/zip-files and patches. This one excels in convenience, and 
robustness.

CVS is a very advanced version control system, however. I do wish that 
Subversion (which is a VCS that I have to use against my will) was as good as 
it is.

        <title>Tower of Babel and God the Dwarf</title>
      </meta>
      <quote><body><p>A few weeks ago, I've been to Freenode's #perl, talking to merlyn and other
guys, when we got to discuss the Biblical "Tower of Babel Myth". As it turned
out, the commonly perceived interpretation was not the one most scholars find
as more sensible, which is the one we ended up being taught at Junior High
School. </p><p>What most people think is something like that: </p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
The people spoke to each other in the same language, concentrated in one place,
and decided to build a tower high enough so they can reach God. God, a small
dwarf who lived in the sky, was afraid of the efforts of these people, because
he feared they'll reach him. So he casted an 8th level Spell of Language
Fragmentation, caused these people to speak in different tongues, and without
being able to understand each other, they ended up spreading across the Earth.
God was relieved and returned to his dwarfish deeds, as dwarfs do.

          <text><![CDATA[> This reminds me of Paul Graham's articles, in which he claims that LISP

No. 1 is true, naturally. No. 2 is not true - I know LISP but I prefer Perl. 
Other like Python, etc. The reasons I don't prefer LISP are:

1. The standards of Common LISP and Scheme don't define anything practical.
2. LISP is at the moment incredibly verbose.
3. As Larry Wall noted, all LISP code comes in parenthesis and so it all looks 
the same. (Perl is the exact opposite in this regard).
4. I cannot make heads nor tails of serious LISP code. Many LISPers create so 
many macros and use them along with regular LISP code, so you keep having to 
refer to the previous definitions, and make a lot of research to get you 
started.

SICP Scheme is easy and fun. But serious LISP code can take too much time to 
understand. OTOH, recently I had little problem reading the source code of 
other Perl programmers, and extending it or fixing bugs. (likewise for 
Python).

problem I have with KMail at work, where I cannot start KAddressBook from
inside it. I asked my question and soon afterwards received:</p>

<!-- TODO: Convert to <ol /> and <li /> -->
<p>* One Thunderbird recommendation.<br />
* Two Evolution recommendations.<br />
* One Sylpheed Claws recommendation.<br />
* One GMail recommendation.</p>

<p>The problem is that I wasn't interested to learn about alternative E-mail
clients, and just wanted to get my problem solved. And in GMail's case it was
completely out of the question due to my work's constraints. </p><p>    -- Shlomi Fish in

      <quote><body><p>RTFM vs. JATFM 
--------------</p><p>I recently had to figure out how to do something with wget: get everything
below a directory on the web-server, without following links to outside it. So
I logged in to FreeNode's #debian channel, where there are many knowledgable
people to ask it. The first answer I got was "RTFM". So, I read the wget man
page, but could not find it there. Eventually, after telling people that it
would be faster to give an answer, I got a reply ( add the -np -r flags). But
this has been the last straw. </p><p>I composed my own acronym. Just like RTFM is "Read the Fabulous Manual" and
STFW is "Search the Fabulous Web", then JATFM is "Just Answer the Fabulous
Man". It means that it's usually faster to answer someone's question than to
ask him to RTFM, which is just going to annoy him. I think the RTFM mantra has
done a lot of damage in the UNIX/Linux world, and I hope JATFMing would prove
to be a more healthy ideology. </p><p>    -- Shlomi Fish in

I don't suppose we should propose that as an alternative to Perl Gods, there 
should at least be Perl Saints:

http://www.stallman.org/saint.html

Of course, I'm not sure what being a Perl saint would imply. Using nothing but 
Perl? (Including not C in which perl 5 is written?)

Oh well.

Not that I mind the Perl Gods stereotype stuff.

Regards,

        Shlomi Fish (a Perl saint^W hero wannabe, but definitely 
        not a Perl God)

I almost feel honor bound now to start a noise band called The Randal
Schwartz Condition.  I could shout his rants into a microphone while
the rest of the band flogged a newbie live on stage.

everybody?

going over to the computer with a large amount of punch cards and then 
dropping them all.

<saying who="rillo">ah. i&#39;m new to python so i diddnt know</saying>
<saying who="scorchsaber">A few days ago, it was suggested that I implement ++ using the + operator.</saying>
<saying who="scorchsaber">And I did so. :)</saying>
<saying who="scorchsaber">So, really, a++; is valid in Python, and it may even increment a by one. If somebody was crazy, anyhow, and if a was mutable.</saying>
<saying who="rillo">shall i move back to perl to get the ++</saying>

<saying who="yrlnry">Hi, I heard that Perl is just HTML with some sort of macro preprocessor attached.  So I thought you would be the right people to ask about whether there is a way to make the submitted value on an &lt;input type=submit&gt; different from the visible label on the button.</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">Thanks in advance.</saying>
<me_is who="Roderick">tars and feathers yrlnry.</me_is>
<saying who="yrlnry">Hi, Roderick!  How&#39;s the kid?</saying>
<saying who="Somni">you have been misinformed, sir; Perl is just a regex engine with named variables</saying>

<saying who="yrlnry">You need to get out more, seriously.</saying>

<saying who="ne2k__">yrlnry: not that it has anything to do with perl, but the &lt;input&gt; tag in HTML has both &quot;name&quot; and &quot;value&quot; attributes. the value is what gets shown in the browser typically.</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">ne2k__: yes, and the value is also what is submitted when someone presses the button, but I want the displayed label to be different from what it submitted, as it is say with &lt;option ...&gt;</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">BASIC has greatly evolved since Dartmouth BASIC.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Juerd: yes, very.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Juerd: anyway, I expect that at every given time all tests will pass.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">How long does it take Pugs to run the entire Pugs test suite?</saying>
<saying who="TimToady">but a number of them were misunderstandings at the time</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Because Pugs is kinda slow.</saying>
<saying who="diakopter">defudge should be renamed Passover...</saying>
<saying who="TimToady">used to run on my old laptop in about 25 minutes</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">TimToady: or cute bugs.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I mean implementation details.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">TimToady: kinda long.</saying>

<saying who="TimToady">I haven&#39;t tried on my new laptop, since I haven&#39;t installed the lates ghc yet</saying>
<saying who="TimToady">first make it run, then make it run right, then make it run fast</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">TimToady: another problem with Pugs is that it kept requiring the latest ghc.</saying>
<saying who="Juerd">Did pugs drive GHC development perhaps? :D</saying>
<saying who="TimToady">shrug, you shouldn&#39;t pick on a software project when it&#39;s down</saying>

<saying who="TimToady">of the first six ingredients, five of them are hot.  Red habanero pods, cayenne chilies, white vinegar, natural pepper flavor, ancho chilies, chipotle chilies, molasses, guava nectar, fresh ginger, salt, spices.</saying>
<saying who="TimToady">&#39;bout 550,000 scovilles</saying>
<saying who="TimToady">After Death is only about 500k</saying>
<saying who="TimToady">Tabasco is only about 35k</saying>
<saying who="spinclad">tabasco i&#39;m calibrated on -- now i can (only) imagine</saying>
<saying who="TimToady">so roughly 15 times hotter</saying>
<saying who="spinclad">&#39;add 1/15 drop per 100 potatoes&#39;</saying>

<saying who="pmurias">rindolf: what is Park/Spark?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pmurias: http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/Park-Lisp/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pmurias: it&#39;s still incomplete.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And I haven&#39;t updated it.</saying>
<saying who="pmurias">rindolf: if you like lisp/perl6 projects you might consider helping with a common lisp elf backend</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pmurias: Common Lisp.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pmurias: thing is I think both CL and Scheme suck.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I like Lisp as a concept.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Arc is nice, but has too many implementation problems.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And missing features.</saying>
<saying who="vixey">Arc is not nice</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I want to give a presentation to the Perl Mongers about &quot;Foreign Languages: Lisp&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vixey: I like it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Though I hate that &quot;(not)&quot; has become &quot;(no)&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">it&#39;s so non-English.</saying>
<saying who="vixey">it&#39;s just TCL with horrible syntax</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vixey: but it&#39;s missing  a lot of exciting features.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Which PG deemed as unnecessary.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Doesn&#39;t look like the 100-years language to me.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Which is why - Spark!</saying>
<saying who="pmurias">why not just write an s-expression p6 dialect?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pmurias: could be.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">pmurias: it&#39;s another approach.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">But some things make sense in Lisp and not in p6.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">For example, Perl does not like to use + for string or list concat.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">While Python does and it seems to be OK in Arc too.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And in CL you have (concatenate) (yuck!).</saying>
<saying who="pbuetow">(((hehe)))</saying>
<saying who="pmurias">+ for strings sucks</saying>
<saying who="Auzon">seconded.</saying>
<saying who="vixey">rindolf: If you don&#39;t like CONCATENATE you can just rename it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vixey: yeah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vixey: but I&#39;d rather not rename concatenate because then people won&#39;t understand my code.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vixey: as TimToady said people hate abstractions.</saying>
<saying who="vixey">yes they will rindolf</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">They want things to work out of the box.</saying>
<saying who="vixey">A program is many many totally newly defined procedures</saying>
<saying who="vixey">just renaming one thing is nothing in the context of a big program</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vixey: &quot;let&#39;s spend 3 days creating a new language, and 1 day implementing the solution with it.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="TimToady">if it would take 10 days without the new language, it&#39;s worth it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">TimToady: yeah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">TimToady: but this is the CL mentality.</saying>
<saying who="vixey">no it&#39;s not</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Sometimes you can take 1 day to write an API.</saying>
<saying who="vixey">CL is too diverse you cannot generalize like that</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vixey: I meant a common idiom there.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I think I&#39;ll /quit and do something productive.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Like work on Spark.</saying>
<saying who="vixey">another quote:</saying>
<saying who="vixey">how to write any computer program in two easy stages:</saying>
<saying who="vixey">Design and implement the programming language which would be best for solving the problem.</saying>
<saying who="vixey">Write the program in the language you’ve just implemented.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vixey: or just use Perl which is the best for everything.</saying>

            <p>
                Richard M. Stallman (RMS) decides to release his brand-new
                editor, "Emacs" on the CPAN with its first version 29.999.99.
                In order to package it, he invokes the trusty ol'
                module-starter (see http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Starter/
                ) which creates a skeleton of a CPAN distribution for him.
            </p>

            <p> 
                He fills in the skeleton with the actual code of Emacs, types
                "perl Build.PL", and "./Build test" and makes sure all the
                tests pass. Then he types "./Build config --gui" and gets a
                nice GUI to configure the various parameters of the Module
                meta-data.[M-B-Data]
            </p>

            <p> 
                In the GUI, Richard goes to the Trove categorisation tab, and
                selects categories. This is done in a similar way to
                Freshmeat's project categorisation dialog (a list of options to
                the left, with selected options to the right and arrows to move
                them left or right, while allowing multiple select options.).
                He chooses such categories as "Programming Language :: Lisp",
                and "Intended Audience :: Emacs Users", "Operating System ::
                GNU", and "Topic :: Editors". (Note: I believe the category
                list should be fetched using a public web-service to keep them
                up-to-date.)

            <p>
                After several weeks of having the editor on CPAN, Richard has
                received many patches, and wrote a lot of code on his own. Now
                Emacs is not only an editor but a calendar tool, an Eliza
                program, a web browser, a mail user agent and many other
                things.
            </p>

            <p> 
                So in order to release version 30.000.00 he needs to update the
                categorisation.  He runs ./Build config --gui again, and adds
                more categories. However, he enters too many categories
                (because Emacs now does them all), and the GUI refuses  to save
                the file because it will overflow the limit that the
                web-service specified the CPAN classification services allow to
                handle. So Richard keeps only the important categories, adds
                more tags, and saves it.
            </p>

            <p>
                He then tests the distribution again, and uploads the new
                distribution to the CPAN.

            <p>
Bill Gates, CEO of Microsoft decides to use Richard Stallman's Emacs as the
basis of his company's state-of-the-art product Microsoft Editing Macros™ 
Enterprise Edition XP .NET Professional. However since MS Editing Macros™ is 
a commercial, proprietary program which he intends to sell at computer stores, 
Bill is not going to upload it to the CPAN. He builds upon Emacs, sends 
patches to  Richard and learns a lot about it.
</p>

<p>
When he's finished building Microsoft Editing Macros™ he surfs to the
Emacs homepage on CPAN, and adds some categories and tags of his own.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, enough people like Bill tag and categorise Emacs, and it gains
more classification.

<saying who="Similian">is there a smart way to read a file to a certain string bit by bit ?</saying>
<saying who="Similian">which loop to use?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Similian: you can read it byte by byte.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Similian: do you want to read the whole thing?</saying>
<saying who="Similian">no</saying>
<saying who="Similian">too big 200 MB</saying>
<saying who="simcop2387-lab">reading bit by bit is usually not supported by most operating systems</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Similian: then do you want to read one byte at a time?</saying>
<saying who="ik">or one line at a time?</saying>
<saying who="Similian">guess a line would be better</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">simcop2387-lab: it is on my rindolfOS running on Intel 1001.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Which was a 1-bit processor.</saying>
<saying who="ik">heh</saying>
<saying who="ik">I had a half-bit processor</saying>
<saying who="ik">it just stored ones</saying>
<saying who="danieldg">ik: that would be a zero-bit processor then</saying>
<saying who="ik">no no</saying>
<saying who="danieldg">half-bit processor stores 0&#39;s or sqrt(2)&#39;s</saying>
<saying who="ik">sqrt(2) may as well be 1</saying>
<saying who="simcop2387-lab">rindolf: a 1 bit processor would be a hell of a thing to work with</saying>
<saying who="danieldg">not if you can&#39;t test it unless it&#39;s one</saying>
<saying who="ik">We&#39;re not talking about numbers, we&#39;re talking about on and off, true and false, whatever you want to call it</saying>
<saying who="ik">sqrt(2) is nonzero, so it&#39;s one.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">danieldg: not 1/sqrt(2)?</saying>
<saying who="danieldg">hmm it would probably be that, yes</saying>
<saying who="simcop2387-lab">my proc uses sqrt[-1]!</saying>
<saying who="ik">may as well</saying>
<saying who="danieldg">ik: think quantum computers. It tests true with probability 1/sqrt(2)</saying>
<saying who="ik">I&#39;m not talking about a quantum computer..</saying>
<saying who="danieldg">well a 1/2 bit computer clearly can&#39;t be classical</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">My father and I joked about sorting the dishes in the dishwasher.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">My father said: &quot;If you won&#39;t sort the dishwasher, the dishwasher won&#39;t be sorted.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Loci64">rindolf: bubble sort *g*</saying>
<saying who="icke">dishsort</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Then I said &quot;No, it won&#39;t be sorted by me.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">So he said &quot;No, it won&#39;t be sorted at all. We will throw the dishwasher.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">&quot;Along with all the dishes.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Loci64: bubble sort is inefficient.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Loci64: you should use quicksort or mergesort.</saying>
<saying who="whoppix">or bashsort, or heapsort!</saying>
<saying who="icke">yeah, but thorough.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Loci64: or for small values of &quot;N&quot; - insertion sort.</saying>
<saying who="whoppix">although I can&#39;t remember if those were stable.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whoppix: what is bashsort?</saying>
<saying who="icke">that matters for a dishwasher</saying>
<saying who="EvanCarroll">/bin/sort</saying>
<saying who="EvanCarroll">duh</saying>
<saying who="Loci64">hehe, but dishwashers usually have medium to large numbers of N ;-) maybe trashsort solves the problem</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">EvanCarroll: perldoc -f sort is more portable.</saying>
<saying who="whoppix">rindolf, shellsort, not bashsort, sorry :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">But I&#39;ll need to build a robot to use it with the dishes.</saying>
<saying who="icke">cshsort</saying>
<saying who="EvanCarroll">here must be a trillion sorting algos</saying>
<saying who="EvanCarroll">and 9/10 of them are total shit</saying>
<saying who="EvanCarroll">and inferior in every way.</saying>
<saying who="EvanCarroll">This sorting algorithem is coveted if you KNOW that only one value is out of perfect order and it sits in the second to last position of the input.</saying>
