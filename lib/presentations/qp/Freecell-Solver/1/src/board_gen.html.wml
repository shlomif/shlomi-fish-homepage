A short time after the release of Freecell Solver 0.2.0, Eric Warmenhoven
sent me a program he prepared to generate the initial boards of GNOME
Freecell so they can later be input into Freecell Solver.

<li>
I thanked him for his effort, and decided to continue the theme.

<li>
So I wrote similar programs to generate the board layouts of GNOME AisleRiot,
PySol, and the Microsoft Freecell/Freecell Pro deals (the latter are considered the standard among hard-core Freecell enthusiasts).
</li>

<li>
Some programs have integrated the Freecell Solver library to allow for
automatically solving a board starting at a position that the player
has reached.
