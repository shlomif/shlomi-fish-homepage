    <p>
    I've broken a taboo and created a Star Wars (and its even better Spaceballs parody)
    and a Star Trek TNG / DS9 (as well as 2020s real online / offline life) crossover:
    <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Queen-Padme-Tales/">Queen Padmé Tales</a>.
    The story so far: slashdot.org's darling Israeli-American filmmaker
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman">Natalie Portman</a>
    has realised that Hollywood's <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-cinema--copyright-cannibalism">disapproval of crossovers / parodies / etc</a>
    and its insistence of accepting only screenplays in its draconian,
    finnicky, and boring format has deprived it of almost all honest
    hobbyist screenplay writers and made most big name "acting-for-fun"
    big name actors "unemployed".
    </p>

    <p>
    So she licensed a few franchises (not that a big studio will dare
    <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=shlomif-fact-taylor-swift-1">sue her</a>
    because its share value will plumet) and decided to direct or codirect
    the 1992-born YouTube pop singer and budding actress
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Alvord">Tiffany Alvord</a>
    as Portman's iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala">Queen Padmé Amidala</a>,
    due to Alvord having better Internet-savviness.
    </p>

    <p>
    Queen Padmé is 10 years into her reign, and needs to handle a range
    of issues, such as her first assassination attempt.
