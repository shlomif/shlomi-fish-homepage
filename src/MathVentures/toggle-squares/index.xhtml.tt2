<p>
This game originated from a Java game by Dr. Ken Housley, whose personal
site has since gone offline. This implementation is JavaScript-based.

<p>
You are presented with a board of squares that can be either of two
colours. The objective is to convert all squares to the same colour.
</p>

<p>
By clicking on a square, you toggle the colour of the square as well as that
of all the neighbouring squares (without wrapping and including the diagonal
ones). As a result, clicking on side or corner squares will toggle
only 6 or 4 squares.
