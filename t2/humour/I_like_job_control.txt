I logged to vipe and
saw something awful was done

Emmmm mmm mmm

Ten processes in the background
Nice value less than one
What can I tell ya -
All the CPU was gone!



Chorus:

I like job control
So put another process in the background, baby
I like job control
So kill another pid with this UID...


I said I was in a terrible state
So I E-mailed advisors to change my fate
But the sys-admin was abroad
So there was no way I could write some code


Chorus:

I like job control
So put another process in the background, baby
I like job control
So kill another pid with this UID...




But then he came back again...

Emmm mmm mmm

I wanted him to get the processes bust
So I E-mailed him and said:

"Let them eat the dust!"


Chorus:

I like job control
So put another process in the background, baby
I like job control
So kill another pid with this UID...


All's well that ends well

Emmmm mmm mmm

Vipe was clean for all I could tell
There's just a SETI client running around
But it's nice is twenty so I'm Linux-bound


Chorus:

I like job control
So put another process in the background, baby
I like job control
So kill another pid with this UID...


Chorus:

I like job control
So put another process in the background, baby
I like job control
So kill another pid with this UID...

And repeat to the end.
