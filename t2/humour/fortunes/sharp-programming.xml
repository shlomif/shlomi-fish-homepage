<saying who="joeyadams">lol.  Zuu&#39;s probabilistic, so maybe he can solve you.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">but i guess i have now</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Formal definition of Turing hard:  blah blah blah hard blah blah Turing blah.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">Hahahaha :D</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Wikipedia:   Given a set X in P(N), a set A in N is called Turing hard for X if X &lt;=_T A for all X in X. If additionally A is in X, then A is called Turing complete for X.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Does that clarify?</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_reduction for the actual math symbols)</saying>
<me_is who="joeyadams">assumes you get the point</me_is>
<saying who="Zuu">yeah, i think i&#39;ll have to put significant time into that, for me to comprehend it :)</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">but maybe i will, some day :P</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">My point is that people like to use mumbo jumbo to describe more concise mumbo jumbo.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">E.g. A problem is NP-hard if it is at least as hard as all the problems in NP.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">i undersstand enough of it, to be fairly confident that rindolf being turing hard, will not say much about his ability to be solved</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">I&#39;m guessing Turing-hard means you can&#39;t solve a problem with a Turing machine (e.g. the halting problem)</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">(substitute Turing machine with &quot;your computer&quot; :) )</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">no, turing hard has something to do with expressiveness</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">okay, Zuu &gt; joeyadams, so I can&#39;t help you :)</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">tickles joeyadams ^^</me_is>
<saying who="joeyadams">A delicious apple is any fruit ∈ apple that is at least as tasty as any other fruit ∈ apple.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">In other words, apples are in the set of recursively nommable fruits.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">joeyadams: what&#39;s up?</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">I&#39;m babbling.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">joeyadams: Apple is one of my least favourite fruits.</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">watches a number of apples that recursively NOM&#39;s eathother</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">It tends to be too commonplace.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Or simpleton.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">whoops, my logic is incorrect</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Only delicious apples are ∈ the nommable fruits.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">(recursively is just a word you throw in to sound smart)</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">NOMs joeyadams :&gt;</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">joeyadams: a friend of one of my sisters said that Apple is his favourite fruit.</saying>

<me_is who="joeyadams">has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection nommed by peer))</me_is>
<saying who="Zuu">yeah, unfortunately a lot of people throw with a lot of words to sound smart :/</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">my favourite fruit is a recursive banana!</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">although it certainly helps to use complex terminology to solve complex problems.  As Aristophanes said, &quot;High thoughts must have high language.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">.. along with immutable polymorphic pears</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Zuu&gt; I guess you have to peel it indefinitely?</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">lol</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">Hahah, yeah :P</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">I tend to eat bananas in deterministic polynomial time.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">i eat them in linear time, but uses exponential space</saying>

<saying who="Zuu">Hi rindolf :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Hi Zuu </saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: I&#39;ve been thinking that maybe you can find some corresponding Zuus of the appropriate sex in a different dimension.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">hmmm... interresting!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: are you a heterosexual Zuu or a homosexual one?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">Im not sure what sex I am.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">:P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: you can look.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: in the mirror or something.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: don&#39;t you have obligatory genders in Danish/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Like in German, French, etc.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Or Hebrew and Arabic.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">obligatory genders?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">you mean, the genders in linguistics?</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">never understood those</me_is>
<saying who="Zuu">but Danish have two i believe, and if i remember correctly there is female and &#39;none&#39;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: yes, genders in linguistics.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">i dont remember what which is which though :P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Like in Hebrew &quot;Haben Halakh lagan&quot; - the boy went to the garden. &quot;Habath Halkha lagan&quot; - &quot;The girl went to the garden&quot;</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">That almost sounds like allah akbar</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">rindolf, no we dont distinct between the genders of the subject in the danish language</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">our nouns have genders though</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">zuu-nina?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">like &#39;house&#39; is one gender and &#39;car&#39; is another</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: of course the question is - what language do Zuus speak natively?</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">rindolf: Of course, Zuu speaks Zuu!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuuish?</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">The Zulu population also does not speak Zuluish, just Zulu.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">so if you want to say &#39;the house&#39; its &#39;huse_t_&#39; and if you want to say &#39;the car&#39; its &#39;bile_n_&#39;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">c_sphere: Arnavoth (sounds like an Aztec god) is &quot;Hares&quot; (the Rabbit-like mammal) in Hebrew.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: can you understand Swedish?</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">Aemeth</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">rindolf, some :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">swedish branched from danish afaik</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">same with norwegian</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">yes, Zuu&#39;s speak Zuuish nativley :P</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">is listening to Hans Zimmer - Jack Sparrow</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">Zuuish have few words, all of which is based on words about cake from othre languages :P</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">c_sphere, are you by any chance related to s_cube ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: ah, what do you use the Hebrew word &quot;עוגיה&quot; (= `ugiyah, cookie) for?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">&quot;Chocolate chip pie crust marmalade marzipan cookie yum yum!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">i use it for cookies baked from a hebrew recipe :P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">What does it mean in Zuuish?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">it&#39;s hard to really say something in Zuuish... al you can really do is say something equivalent to &quot;COOKIES!!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">or &quot;YAY CAKE!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">basically, you can only express excitement over different kinds of cakes :P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: do Zuus eat anything except cakes or cookies?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">There was this one time...</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">wait.. no. That was someone else.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Chekov: I disagere with what ESR says in TAOUP that you shouldn&#39;t apply factor optimisations. I think they can make a very large difference.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Chekov: he seems to imply you should wait until computers are fast enough.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Problem is people don&#39;t want to upgrade and if a competing program (maybe a fork ) is much faster, then some of them will switch.</saying>

<saying who="oilio">yeah, I read about it in the wikipedia</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">marzy: Emacs is not a better vim. They are very different.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">marzy: I could never get used to Emacs, but have used Vim for many years.</saying>
<saying who="marzy">rindolf Emacs + Evil mode makes a better vim</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">marzy: does it support all Vim extensions?</saying>
<saying who="marzy">no, that&#39;s why its better. it doesn&#39;t come with retarded scripting language!!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">marzy: well, it&#39;s still not 100% compatible with vim.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">marzy: and Evil is an awful name. Sorry.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">&quot;The only thing more evil than XSLT is XSLT edited with Emacs Evil mode.&quot; ;-)</saying>
<saying who="marzy">i think it&#39;s a good name considering emacs and vi(m) rivalry</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">marzy: of course, I&#39;ve heard worse - coq and coccinelle.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And then there&#39;s this guy here who called his programming language Flua which reminds me of Flu and Influenza.</saying>
<saying who="Reactionary">rindolf: lol</saying>
<saying who="dardevelin">rindolf, flua IDE is not that bad to be fair (at least the little i tried )</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dardevelin: didn&#39;t say *it* was bad - I said the name was bad.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dardevelin: and I could never get it running here. Problems with Py3 and PyQt.</saying>
<saying who="dardevelin">rindolf, oh that sucks... :/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dardevelin: yes.</saying>
<saying who="dardevelin">rindolf, yeah i know you didn&#39;t said it was bad, just as gave you my opinion on it as a side note. sorry i should have made it more explicit :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Of course, Evil is not as bad a name as SLIME, which is another Emacs mode.</saying>
<saying who="dardevelin">rindolf, i had troubles with SLIME once and boy i got tired of fighting with it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Reportedly it was also the nickname of an internal Microsoft version control system called SLM (that is now largely discontinued).</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">codescience: people can sell copies of open source software or services related to it.</saying>
<saying who="codescience">hmmm, i understand</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">codescience: see http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html</saying>
<saying who="ssta">I can legally sell you this copy of the linux kernel...I can charge whaqtever you are willing to pay.  Nothing in the license prevents this</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: will you sell it to me for 5,000 USD?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">;-)</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: sure</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: how about for 3,000 USD?</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: tell you what, for $10,000 I&#39;ll throw in a free copy of FreeBSD</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: wow, sounds like a good deal.</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: hmm, 3000 is a bit low, I don&#39;t think I could go that cheap</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: how much are you selling the source code of Apache 2.4 for?</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: oh, you can have that for free</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: really?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Sucker!</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: sure...but the build scripts you have to pay for</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: would you be willing to exchange the source of the Linux kernel for three copies of jQuery? I will even throw in a few free Dojo plugins.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: he already told us.</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: hmm, not sure I want jQuery</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: would you happen to have code for a halfway decent RDBMS?  I think I could swap for that</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: I have the source code for MySQL. Not sure if it&#39;s half-decent.</saying>
<saying who="codescience">i run a mysql server. runs good enough for me</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: I use MySQL in production quite a lot.  It has its flaws, but my use cases never seem to hit them</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: so will you exchanges its source code for the Linux kernel?</saying>
<saying who="ssta">rindolf: sure</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: sounds good.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ssta: you can find the source code of MySQL here - http://www.mysql.com/</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Jude: quite encouraging.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">why</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: what is encouraging?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I mean that some television producers are having a clue about piracy.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I think the MPAA is likely going to follow the lead of the RIAA and endorse the Internet.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: well, there&#39;s still a long way to go with even music online.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Jude++</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: it&#39;s directed at little girls.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: so it&#39;s a pretty clean show.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">yeah I know</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I was kidding</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: if you want incest and violence, then look no further than the Jewish bible.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">there are a lot of dubbing sections of the show to go with metal songs or violent scripts etc</saying>
<saying who="Jude">rindolf, I&#39;m jewish</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: reportedly, it was quite realism then (the Bible I mean).</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: ah, nice. So am I.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">and I couldn&#39;t agree more</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I have to go watch game of thrones</saying>

<saying who="Jude">he&#39;s my brother, he lives close to you and he&#39;s also an open-source enthusaist</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I know</saying>
<saying who="Jude">there are plenty of them</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: ah, that&#39;s great.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I take them to uni on a daily basis</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I live right by rabin sq.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: so you study in TAU?</saying>
<saying who="Jude">yeah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: TAU has tons of hot chicks.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">there are some</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: there aren&#39;t a lot of people on the streets of Gimmel.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: so you study CS?</saying>
<saying who="Jude">no way</saying>
<saying who="Jude">maths</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: ah, I see.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: maths...</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I know one or two nice looking girls, but I usually get put off by their personalities</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I think maths is taught wrong in several aspects.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I&#39;ve only been attracted to one specimen of the female sex ever</saying>
<saying who="Jude">in my entire life</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: ah, really?</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I dunno, I agree when you speak of highschool maths</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I like university maths so far</saying>
<saying who="Jude">my professors are really nice</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: well, there are a lot of girls studying more humane stuff.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: http://blogs.perl.org/users/shlomi_fish/2013/03/ann-my-transition-from-software-developer-to-writerentertaineramateur-philosopherinternet-celebrity.html</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I generally don&#39;t like people who study humane subjects (I don&#39;t consider philosophy to be as such though)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I&#39;ve made a transition from a mathematician to a software developer and now I&#39;m more of a writer/entertainer/amateur-philosopher.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">you didn&#39;t like the way it was taught?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: like which way?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: you mean maths?</saying>
<saying who="Jude">yes</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: well: 1. No pairwise work. Big mistake.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">2. Need to memorise a lot of silly stuff. Why??</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">3. Maybe allow some sloppiness. Make maths more humane.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">that&#39;s why you got philosophy</saying>
<saying who="Jude">maths can&#39;t afford to be sloppy</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">There&#39;s something poetical about many maths&#39; proofs.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">the intuitive ideas behind them</saying>
<saying who="Jude">are beautiful</saying>
<saying who="Jude">but intuition can be misleading</saying>
<saying who="Jude">that&#39;s why you have to be really strict</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: yes, that&#39;s why I think we should now move into proof verifier realm.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">if you want your proof to be valid</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: right.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: but I was once criticised for this - http://ladypine.livejournal.com/24574.html</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: thing is - not everything should be strict when teaching.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I agree that mathematical intuition can be misleading, but it&#39;s still a good thing to have.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: thing is I think many mathematicians now require a lot of dedication and selling their soul to the devil, which is turning them into http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Nemo -s.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">it&#39;s not a very formal proof</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: when I studied EE most of my courses were with open material, and I could do pairwise work, which I enjoyed.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">but seems to hold</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: yes.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I guess you are right</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: :-D</saying>
<saying who="Jude">that the concept is more important than the formalization</saying>
<saying who="Jude">but a lot of my professors agree with you</saying>
<saying who="Jude">and would give much more attention to grasping the important concept, and understanding intuition behind proofs</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: I&#39;m always right. Unless I claim that &quot;A is not-A&quot;. But Chuck Norris would be right even then.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">lol</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Hah! A new Chuck Norris factoid.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">&lt;3</saying>
<saying who="Jude">it&#39;s been nice chatting with you, I really have to go now, I need to watch GoT and then go to bed and wake up in 4 hours</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: my father and I now have an ongoing Chuck Norris meme.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: bye, have fun, and good night.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">rindolf, what&#39;s that</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: what?</saying>
<saying who="Jude">the Chuck Norris meme</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Jude: well, we say stuff like &quot;you&#39;re my most Chuck Norris dad.&quot; or &quot;I taught Chuck Norris how to fight.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">It&#39;s a personal running joke.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, a family-wide one.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">We have our own jargon.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">heh</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Most families do.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">I&#39;m not close enough to any member of my family</saying>
<saying who="Jude">to do that</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Ah.</saying>
<saying who="Jude">talk to you later, ciao</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Bye.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">rindolf: Douglas Hofstadter gave a talk about how mathematicians aren&#39;t as rigorous as they claim to be</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">and that they use a lot of analogical thinking</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: ah, OK.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">it was at the university of Toronto</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">I missed it sadly though</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: was it filmed?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">but I can basically tell you what he said more or less</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">rindolf: there was a webcast</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">not sure if it can be accessed still</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">&lt;+Nisstyre-laptop&gt; but if you read either GEB or I Am a Strange Loop you&#39;ll get it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: I read GEB.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: GEB was a nice book, but I knew a lot of what he was saying there.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: I still enjoyed the drama stuff in the middle with Achilles, the Tortoise and their friends.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">rindolf: you had the idea of using PM as a metaphor for systems of thinking and the mind?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">because that&#39;s what the book is about</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: PM?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">principia mathematica</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">the formal system constructed by Russell and Whitehead</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: I didn&#39;t think of it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: yes, I know.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">the entire book is his theory of consciousness</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">and how there are levels of thinking</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: well, I read &quot;I think, therefore I laugh&quot; before I read GEB.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">you can be less of a thinking being, etc...</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Yes, he says that consciousness requires thinking in loops, or self-reflection.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, it&#39;s an informal theory of consciousness.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">it requires what he calls a strange loop</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">and there can be many levels to it</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">more levels == what we think of as more human or more conscious beings</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">so PM actually is able to self reflect to an extent</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">although it requires a human to interpret it</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I believe, that creating artificial intelligence/artificial consciousness won&#39;t be easy to do, will require a lot of complex code, and will likely be faulty (have its own will, make mistakes, not run as quickly as more specialised code, etc.).</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Nisstyre-laptop: yes.</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">depends what you mean by AI</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">there are several different definitions</saying>
<saying who="gde33">the first human like robot will be build in japan, the first artifical intelligence in the us</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">heh</saying>
<saying who="gde33">hahaha</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">the church-turing hypothesis would seem to imply it&#39;s possible, at least in principle</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">to create &quot;strong&quot; AI</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">although I intensely dislike that term</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">since it tries to say that any system of thinking that doesn&#39;t work exactly the same as a human one isn&#39;t AI</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">which is BS</saying>
<saying who="gde33">you guys are all worried about intelligence, I think that will be the easy part. Then comes the important stuff: giving it a sense of humor.</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">so there was the idea that consciousness is associated with information flow, and that &quot;more&quot; information flow is &quot;More&quot; consciousness, a continuum like gravity... but gravity can produce a qualitatively different effect past a certain level (black holes..)</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">so the &quot;loop&quot; is where information flow becomes qualitatively different ?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">doomlord: have you read GEB?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">it would be the ability a system has to observe itself, and encode the system itself in the system</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">in otherwords self reflection</saying>
<saying who="gde33">I don&#39;t know many people who can be truly accused of having their own thoughts</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">i dont thinkso but i have some related quotes from somewhere</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">but can a system only approximate itself</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">principia mathematica has that ability</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">can a computer emulate itself...</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">as Goedel showed</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">you can encode formulas in PM as formulas in PM</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">doomlord: yes</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">but to what practical extent</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">what is that supposed to mean?</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">nature has many &#39;feedback loops&#39; involving information</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">physical limitations result in a hard limit of feedback loops</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">whats GEB, links?</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">if you point a camera at a mirror eventually it will &quot;stop&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">doomlord: it&#39;s a book</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">Godel, Escher, Bach</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">ah google reveals</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">but the sequel is more clear on what it&#39;s about</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">I Am A Strange Loop</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">ok sounds interestign</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">doomlord: anyway, if you nest implementations of a computer in a computer eventually there will be a limit imposed by the physical situation</saying>
<saying who="Nisstyre-laptop">i.e. the memory and processor speed</saying>
<saying who="gde33">only for limited thinkers</saying>
<saying who="gde33">it&#39;s like entropy, only for people who are afraid to think :P</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">but dont physical systems also have practical limitations</saying>
<saying who="gde33">yes but those are not what we imagine them to be</saying>
<saying who="gde33">if only we knew the meaning of life, that would make things so much easier</saying>
<saying who="Stryyker">how?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I think the whole &quot;AIs spawning AIs&quot; dream is not a good strategy for doing software dev. I think programming is here to stay. It&#39;s not like humans can efficiently do what a dedicated polynomial time program can.</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">even humans get programmed, lol</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">doomlord: yes.</saying>
<saying who="gde33">that new immortality project had some interesting videos</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">doomlord: a large part of human technology is mental.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">doomlord: in fact, we can no longer survive without our mental technology. We couldn&#39;t for thousands of years.</saying>
<saying who="gde33">oh but we can</saying>
<saying who="gde33">just need a favorable environment</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">cultural template = human OS</saying>
<saying who="gde33">not mine</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gde33: you can survive without your mental technology? Even without conceptual thought?</saying>
<saying who="gde33">not sure what you mean</saying>
<saying who="gde33">isn&#39;t that what all the other species do?</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">i saw some TED talk trying to explain the difference between chinese and western spending/saving habits in the way the language encourages people to think about time</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">supposedly chinese language makes it harder to think of past,present,future seperately</saying>
<saying who="gde33">languages can be really weird</saying>
<saying who="gde33">all languages have the word &quot;argument&quot; but some want it to have aditional meanings, I believe in china an argument is equal to disobedience. lol</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">huh?</saying>
<saying who="gde33">in english it is a kind of fight</saying>
<saying who="gde33">争 is a dispute 争论 is an argument or debate</saying>
<saying who="gde33">I cant think of good examples, I used to know a girl who knew many languages</saying>
<saying who="gde33">she showed me how some things are badly broken in some languages</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">is it true japanese can&#39;t say &quot;no&quot;, they have to repeat the question in negative..</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">thats what we were told when learning but they must have a word for no surely</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">doomlord: there is &quot;Hai&quot; for Yes and &quot;iie&quot; for no</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">so its just impolite to say &quot;no&quot; i guess</saying>
<me_is who="Belxjander">is living in Japan</me_is>
<saying who="Belxjander">doomlord: you lose context...</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">doomlord: in English you don&#39;t repeat</saying>
<saying who="gde33">hah no</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">but in Japanese you do</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">gde33: depends on the person... my mother and father thought nothing of explaining politeness to me and will happilly talk overtop me when I am speaking</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gde33: I only know (Modern) Hebrew, English, some mostly forgotten Written Arabic, and some French (which I&#39;m now trying to regain).</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">I have also run into the same from Chinese, Japanese, American, European AND African people I have met</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gde33: well, I also know bits of other languages like Spanish, Russian, German, etc.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gde33: I know that in Hebrew we have compulsive genders for objects, so we don&#39;t care about phrasing sentences in a gender-neutral form, which is an English obsession.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">gde33: I think it is parodied in this book - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinny_Legs_and_All_%28novel%29 (great one, BTW - taught me a lot).</saying>
<saying who="doomlord">heh languages with sexism built in.. gender all the way through</saying>
<saying who="gde33">some languages are also more emotional than others</saying>
<saying who="gde33">italians are hilarious</saying>
<saying who="gde33">so much enthusiasm it makes you think something is going on</saying>
<saying who="Belxjander">gde33: spoken or written and the correct manner for if you are addressing &quot;up/peer/down&quot; the social ladder with regards respect... yes</saying>
<saying who="gde33">Belxjander: does that apply to many words?</saying>

<saying who="cousteau">jamming all the time, having to remove an accordion-shaped paper each time</saying>
<saying who="cousteau">turns out there was another sheet jammed, but it was hidden and the printer wasn&#39;t detecting it</saying>
<saying who="pulse">i wonder if printers will still jam paper in the year 3000</saying>
<saying who="pulse">maybe it&#39;s a paradox of physics</saying>
<saying who="pulse">a fluke in nature</saying>
<saying who="`Gin">I think its more down to the fact printer companies have been milking their cash cow dry, £10 in R&amp;D each year. etc.</saying>
<saying who="pulse">maybe some day paper will become obsolete, then there will be no problem anymore</saying>
<saying who="`Gin">There are still employees at my job who would prefer to print an email out, read it and then reply to the email.</saying>
<saying who="`Gin">I don&#39;t have much hope for that dream pulse :P</saying>

<saying who="cousteau">the machine rebellion will start with printers, it&#39;s a known fact</saying>
<saying who="koollman">I suppose the equivalent of paper jam with a 3d printer can get really messy</saying>
<saying who="cousteau">heh</saying>
<saying who="koollman">&quot;we cannot access the printer, it is inside a large blob of solidified plastic&quot;</saying>

<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: sorry, I meant that it&#39;s great that svn.php.net is up.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: haha ya. Pretty exciting, might write a short novella about it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">The Svniliion: The trials and tribulations of a programmers journey to get information about php</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">“The day when svn.php.net returned.” -- by olamachon</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: Ah thats it. So much better.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: Hopefully I&#39;ll get like a 10 sec clip in some svn documentary on the history channel</saying>
<saying who="XMPPwocky">rindolf: you *know* that the people working on svn.php had to have an offline backup</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: I like your title too.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: &quot;And it went down, and that is how I knew it was the beginning of the end&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="XMPPwocky">rindolf: because otherwise nobody could remember which way the arguments go for anything</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: “I sulked in my suffering. It was the kind of suffering that tore your heart to shreds. A programmer’s suffering. Nothing could equal it.”</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">XMPPwocky: ya I was thinking about asking my fellow ner... connoisseurs.... if they might have a backup</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: &quot;a lonely life full of 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: I smell the beginning of an organically grown IRC novel</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: this would definitely make a bestseller.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: maybe I&#39;ll prepare a convo log out of it - http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/sharp-programming.html</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">hahahah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: “I remembered the happy days when I was using the svn server back when it was at its prime. Running. Functioning. These days seem so distant now.”</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">LOL.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: &quot;Soon I realized we were at a turning point in a cultural revolution&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: hmm... you can do &quot;better&quot; than that.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/ - I actually wrote some novellas and screenplay-of-sorts here.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: right right, novellas. I was thinking more like I was the glue guy in a documentary</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: So I was trying to be super cliche</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: so was I.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: I like the ironic cliche where it actually means nothing</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: its just all good sounding filler</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">“I looked at the clock on my desktop. Each seconds seemed like a century. What will I do without the svn server online? What can I do? What can I do about it? Who am I asking all these questions?”</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: I wonder where I first read cliches such as that. Maybe it was someone parodying them.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: &quot;Then I had an existential epiphany. What is SVN? What am I? What are we doing in this universe? This foray into the metaphysical was cut short by a brief glance at the clock. It&#39;s 5 o&#39;clock. f**k this s**t, I&#39;m getting drunk.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: do you actually write?</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: never</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: ah, I see.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: is it that obvious? haha</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: you may be a natural.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: I wrote like an essay or two in university, they were like 2 pages haha</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: ah, so little?</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: I read a copious amount of literature</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: ah, OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: OK, I&#39;ll keep this conversation.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: Perhaps that has a prolific effect on my penchant for the perverse verbosity?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: and put it on that page.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: yes, maybe.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: Sure. I feel like we may be getting a bit off-topic here</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: yes, well, svn.php.net is back - that&#39;s what important.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Seize the svn.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Carpe svn!</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">rindolf: Nice. I see what you did there. I am literally doing that as fast as I can</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, not sure the Latin is right.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">carpe is the seize part</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">&quot;Occupy svn.php.net!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">diem is day</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">olamachon: yes, I know.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">But maybe svn has to be conjugated.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">oh was carpe diem an idiom?</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">carpe svnus?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Carpe svni?</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">^</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Carpe svna?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Carpe svnis?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Not sure.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">My Latin is weak.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I know the plural of Pentium is Pentia.</saying>
<saying who="pyon">olamachon: &quot;Carpe diem&quot; means something like &quot;live/enjoy this day&quot;</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">pyon: Seize the day</saying>
<saying who="pyon">Yeah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, carpe meant quite a few things.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">In Latin at least.</saying>
<saying who="olamachon">This is unbelievably slow. On a 1gbps connection, php docs have been downloading for 15 minutes so far</saying>

<saying who="they">For instance, if you&#39;re making a library called &quot;Jail&quot;, have the top-level folder named &quot;Jail&quot;? So the namespaces below would be &quot;Jail.Whatever&quot;?</saying>

<saying who="Denommus">they: yup</saying>

<me_is who="jrslepak">just names a project&#39;s directory based on the name of the project</me_is>
