<h1>Gamla - a perl-based RAD and application server</h1>
<p>
Welcome to the homepage of the Gamla project. The gamla project
aims to create a Rapid Application Development (RAD) tool and a web
application server based on <a href=
"http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a>. The two objectives were placed
under the hood of one project because I (Shlomi Fish) feels that
they are closely related.
</p>
<p>
All the source code produced by the Gamla project will be under the
public domain. External perl modules that will be used (for
example, DBI) will remain under their original license, assuming we
find the need to modify them.
</p>

If you wish to help, or just participate in the discussions, then
