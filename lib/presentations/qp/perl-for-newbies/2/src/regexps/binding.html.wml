<p>
In a regular expression a caret (<tt>^</tt>) at the beginning of the expression
matches the beginning of the string and a dollar sign (<tt>$</tt>) at the 
<b>end</b> of the expression matches the end of the string.
</p>

<p>
For example, the following program checks if a string is composed entirely of
the letter A:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/regexps/all_as.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
It's much shorter than with using a loop and also much faster.
</p>

<p>
Here's another example. Let's check if a string ends with three periods:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/regexps/string_ends_ellip.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>
