<p>
"Christina Victoria Grimmie" was a fairly unremarkable name, which her parents
chose because they wanted a girl. Nevertheless, she rebelled and announced that
she will be a post-modern take on a tomboy: a gamer she-dork, not unlike
the early
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicia_Day">Felicia Day</a>.
She also joked that as opposed to her middle name, she is "the biggest loser
in history".
</p>

<p>
While she spent large parts of her early years playing video games, eating
and sleeping ( <a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/what_is_hacking.xhtml">and that's alright with me!</a> ),
she eventually started posting covers of pop songs to youtube (possibly out
of <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/multiverse-cosmology/#boredom">lethargy or boredom</a>). While many of her
early recordings were recorded <a href="[% base_path %]humour/fortunes/paul-graham.html">in a non-professional manner</a>, she has met positive critics and pledges
of money and mana. She got a lot of publicity after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2RA0vsZXf8">doing a [high-quality] collaboration with KHS</a>
which earned her more money, fame, mana, and friends. (
<a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/indiv-nodes/meaning-of-able-competent.xhtml">And that's also fine.</a>
)
</p>

<p>
Around the release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireflies_(Owl_City_song)">the song "Fireflies"</a>,
an online friend gave me a link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvAboV8Qfb8">to
its KHS cover</a>
which I loved and listened to many times. I found it better than the original.
Thus, I decided to go on a "Fireflies" youtube covers spree,
and ran into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pac4fa5w9Jo">Grimmie's cover</a>
and for better or for worse said to myself "She's the best!".
</p>

<p>
Christina Grimmie - not Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Rihannah, or
Ariana Grande (all singers with some great songs) - became my new queen of music.
The new Madonna if you may.
</p>

<p id="defence-community">
Given I was <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/multiverse-cosmology/">a terran terminator</a>,
I presume and hope my guardian angels and universal defence/intelligence community
(from the NSA and The Mossad to Iran, the PLO, ISIL, to <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/nav-blocks/blocks/#harry_potter_nav_block">Emma Watson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Joan_Hart">Melissa Joan Hart</a>, and
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/biggest_celeb_crush.xhtml">SMG</a> - I love you all)
have boobytrapped my computer, and monitored me. Even if they didn't, I shared
my sentiments on publicly accessible sites and services.
</p>

<p>
As a result, Grimmie became a multiverse superstar. She received even larger
pledges and unconditional donations of money and mana. Her face appeared on magazines. She was invited
to perform at diverse venues ( including <a href="[% base_path %]humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=shlomif-story-of-Gul-Dukat-in-the-Selinaverse">“Gul Dukat Live on Bajor”</a> ), often finding one or more of her soundalikes and lookalikes already
on stage
(real magic!). She received dividends from unofficial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNZove4OTtI">merchandise sales</a>.
She likely accepted film roles, where she often <a href="[% base_path %]humour/image-macros/indiv-nodes/wandless_emma_watson.xhtml">kicked ass</a>,
including <a href="[% base_path %]humour/TOneW-the-Fountainhead/part2-indiv-nodes/the-fountainboys-in-the-mexican-town.xhtml">peacefully</a>,
but not limited to it.
She was offered record deals, but her record sales skyrocketed regardless,
despite active "piracy".
Finally, just like <a href="[% base_path %]humour/image-macros/indiv-nodes/pbride_philosophers.xhtml">Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle</a> before her,
she or her lookalikes have accepted modelling gigs (including pornographic ones
if those are your cup of tea).
</p>

<p>
Naturally, she didn't rest on her laurels. She continued to improve her skills
as an entertainer. She did collaborations with other musicians (including obscure ones).
She also <a href="[% base_path %]humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=smg-about-giving-back-money-and-time">donated money and time</a>
to causes she considered noble.
Moreover, her bank account credentials were public knowledge (which isn't unusual)
so some individuals extracted money out of her account, without hurting her
profitability.
</p>

<p>
(In my defence, I later was impressed by the works of many other YouTube musicians,
including of male ones and bands and recommended them, but Ms. Grimmie was always the queen for me.)
</p>

<p>
However, I didn't stop at that and entertained thoughts of her as an up&amp;coming
<a href="https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-tech-diary/blob/master/my-candidates-for-terran-leadership.asciidoc">"hacker queen" of our planet</a>:
"If Ayn Rand was born in the 1990s, she would be Christina Grimmie"
( <a href="#if_ayn_rand_was_born_in_the_1990s">Reference</a> ).
As a result, one problem emerged: The-Codex™ explicitly notes that
<q>A vampire can only be slain by other vampires, except for the last standing vampire who will be slain by his favourite children.</q>.
Grimmie was not a vampire, as she was born a wizard, whom are also known as "true prophets". Moreover, I was not the last vampire standing yet.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the game masters who control my media (= "in between") decided,
after a fair die roll, to stage Grimmie's death there (
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/multiverse-cosmology/why-the-so-called-real-world-makes-little-sense/">Reference</a>
).
Note that <a href="#grimmie-is-alive">she was not really killed</a>. Rather,
I was just made to think that.
</p>

<p>
I also suspect that Christina, many other fellow entertainers / creators,
and the <a href="#defence-community">universal defence community</a> cooperated
reluctantly ( <q>Selina: OK, OK. Tell you what? I’ll play along.</q> ).
Nevertheless, the introes and outroes of Grimmie's videos, and also those
of other artists I liked (e.g.: <a href="https://www.tiffanyalvord.com/">Tiffany Alvord</a> )
contain many cuts, likely because they were lying to me.
