<!-- TITLE=Spark, Perl for Newbies Part 5, and Template Toolkit Presentation-->
<p>
I added some pages about <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/Spark/" rel="nofollow">Spark - a new dialect of Lisp under planning</a>, including
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/Spark/mission/" rel="nofollow">its
    mission statement</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
While other general purpose Lisps such as Common Lisp, Scheme, Arc or Clojure
have been influential and have some followers and users, none of them are
actively used with the same popularity as Perl, Python, Ruby or PHP are. Spark
aims to be a popular lisp dialect which will be actively used for real-world
tasks, not just toy or experimentation code.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, it is our hope that some people will get paid to maintain Spark
code. Some of them against their best preferences, like some people now are
maintaining Perl 5, PHP or even Python code while prefering a different
language. (Simply because it puts bread on their table, and they cannot get
paid to write something else.)

I added the 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Newbies/lecture5/" rel="nofollow">fifth 
    part</a> of
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Newbies/" rel="nofollow">the Perl
    for Newbies tutorials/presentations</a>. Furthermore, the Larry
Wall presentation, 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Newbies/vhll-slides.pdf" rel="nofollow">“The 
    Taming of the Camel”</a> is now available there (with a working
link). Moreover, there’s <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Newbies/Perl-for-Newbies-summary.txt" rel="nofollow">now 
    an up-to-date summary of the material covered</a>.
</p>

<p>
The slides of 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Template-Toolkit/" rel="nofollow">the
    lightning talk about the Template Toolkit</a> now has the up-to-date
slides in OpenDocument and PDF formats.
</p>

<p>
There’s now <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/recommendations/films/#monty-python-and-the-holy-grail" rel="nofollow">a 
    recommendation of <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i></a>
on the recommended films page.
</p>

<p>
Many of <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/" rel="nofollow">the fortune
    cookies</a> were enhanced with better markup, hyperlinks and some
corrections.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/contributions/#file-find-object" rel="nofollow">File-Find-Object was added</a> to the FOSS contributions page.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the sources for the various Quad-Pres talks are now kept
inside the <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/site-source/" rel="nofollow">homepage’s 
    version control</a>, which simplifies their build process. This
is an infrastructure change that should help in the site’s maintenance.
