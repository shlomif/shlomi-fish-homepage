I very much enjoy humorous things and like to laugh or be amused a lot.
Since I was 19 years old, I've also been creating my own funny pieces, 
and decided to put them on this web-site for everybody to see. I hope
you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoyed writing them, and still
enjoy thinking about them. <online_casinos_ad />
