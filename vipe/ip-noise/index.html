<h1>Com-Net Lab Project : IP Noise Simulator for the Linux Kernel</h1>


<p>
This page describes the 
<a href="http://comnet.technion.ac.il/">Computer Networks Lab</a>'s
project of creating a simulator of IP noise for the Linux kernel. This site
will be filled with more material as we progress into the project.

<h2>The Project's Purpose</h2>

<p>
The purpose of the project is to program a noise simulator for TCP/IP
noise, which will deliberatly drop and hold IP packets that pass through the
computer. The simulator will support controlled noise, such as a host-based
noise, or one with a time-varying behaviour. 
</p>

<p>
The incensitive for this is to allow researchers and developers to
test whether their protocols are immune to various types of 
network noise.
