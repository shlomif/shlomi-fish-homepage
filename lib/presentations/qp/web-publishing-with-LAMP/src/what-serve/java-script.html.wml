JavaScript (now standarized as 
<a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">ECMAScript</a>) can be used to script the contents of pages,
change their appearance, or control their various on-place widgets. 
</li>
<li>
The implementation of JavaScript varies from browser to browser and sometimes 
has many bugs. Use with care.
</li>
<li>
A general rule of the thumb is that your site should not depend on JavaScript.
</li>
<li>
Do not use JavaScript for linking to another page, changing the appearance of
a link on hover, generating HTML, or other things for which plain HTML 
would do.

<h2>Examples for good uses of JavaScript</h2>

<points>
<li>
Form Validation and Automation at the browser's side. (which does not 
preclude you from having sanity checks at the server).
</li>
<li>
Games. :-)
</li>
<li>
Navigation Menus. (again - the site should not depend on them).

I prepared a <a href="http://perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2004-February/004178.html">discussion</a> of the pros and cons of using JavaScript in pages
one writes.
