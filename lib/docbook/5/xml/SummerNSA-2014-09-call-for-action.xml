        </info>

        <para>
            Your assistance is required in producing the feature film
            “Summerschool at the NSA” based on
            <link xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/">my
                original screenplay</link>. The screenplay is made available
            under the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-by) and its text
            is original. I have designated my
            <link xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/cast.html">recommendations
                for some of the cast</link>, and the film should be capable
            of being filmed mostly
            or entirely in a film studio and at a relatively low cost.
        </para>

        <para>
            Note however that I encourage any productions whatsoever of the
            screenplay, including
            by enthusiastic independent film makers, on
            <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube">YouTube</link>,
            and including producing them as voiced animations.
        </para>

        <para>
            I also neither mind nor discourage any hacks and deviations from
            the
            original screenplay, up to and including featuring
            <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger">Arnold
                Schwarzenegger</link> sending <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna">Rihanna</link> to
            kick the NSA’s ass,
            or <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_the_Frog">Kermit
                the Frog</link> doing the same with
            <link xlink:href="http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Fluttershy">Fluttershy</link>.
            (And you may consider both mutations as artistic challenges).
        </para>

        <para>
            What I do not want is that nothing will get done, and that
            there won’t be any film - by anyone - in the forseeable future.
            So please get to it as soon as you can. I need you, and the world
            needs you.

            The open content / Web 2.0 revolution has proven to be a blazing
            success and a source of decent or better income, esteem,
            and publicity for many individuals, small companies,
            large companies, and other organisations. While during the Web 1.0
            era, information was hard to find, not reliable, and often hard
            to contribute to (what Prof. Lawrence Lessig calls "read only"
            vs. "read/write" in his book
            <link
                xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_%28book%29">Remix</link>,
            which I read and loved.), in the Web 2.0 era, one can
            build upon information, which is often cited and reliable,
            change it, enhance it, and perform
            many remixes as well as

            It is my belief that it was I, Shlomi Fish (“Rindolf”), who was
            the
            <link xlink:href="http://plus.google.com/+ShlomiFish/posts/gyrcAfAASev">“Hacker

            best-of-the-best-of-the-best / The Saladin / The Qoheleth / The
            John Galt / etc.) of that revolution. To quote what Quark from
            the Star Trek franchise said
            about
            the <link xlink:href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Grand_Nagus">Grand

            and the kind of person who has <link

            Nevertheless, my reign as Hacker Monarch has reached its end
            with the writing of the screenplay, <link
                xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/">Summerschool at the NSA</link>.
            The latter mixed and matched Judaism (Tanakh, Talmud, and Israelism),
            Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the
            <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xkcd">xkcd</link>
            web comic, the “99 problems” meme, the old
            “Publish or Perish” adage,
            the deeds and words of
            <link xlink:href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/">Saladin</link>,
            open source and open content, some
            modern but not unthinkable technology,
            love/romance/sex/relationships, pop culture, and humour, and
            more into what
            was essentially a realism,
            <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_person_fiction">Real
                Person Fiction</link>, story. Furthermore, it featured
            fictionalised versions of Sarah Michelle Gellar,
            Summer Glau, and General Keith Alexander, who was the
            director of the NSA at the time.
            I also ended up seeing it as my modernisation of
            <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged">Ayn
                Rand’s Atlas Shrugged novel</link>, which was her
            magnus opus as Hacker Monarch (while still building upon
            it, referencing it, and going against some of it original premises).

        <para>
            Like Atlas Shrugged, “Summerschool at the NSA” was eventually
            understood to be my magnus opus, and I passed the baton to
            someone else, Summer Glau, and thus mostly concluded the
            open content/Web 2.0 revolution with a mostly happy ending and
            a blazing success.

            There will likely be a lot of time to reflect upon my history
            and achievements during my reign as hacker monarch of the world, but
            I think
            the future is more important than the past. I have a lot of
            potential advice we can use to continue to battle the remaining
            man-made
            problems (e.g: bloodshed, suicides, deaths due to arrogance
            and carelessness, possible present and future environmental
            problems, unnecessary red tape and regulations, unnecessary
            hatred, antagonism and distrust, and vandalism)
            and some <link xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/DocBook5/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/machines_that_can_give_questions.html">questions</link> for further inquiry.
            However, it's now also
            up to the new generation of activists of the upcoming post-open
            content / post-Web-2.0 revolution
            (whose nature is yet to be discerned) to build upon the work
            of the activists and action heroes of the open content revolution,
            and take the world even more forward.

            So let me just give some pieces of advice to Ms. (Summer) Glau,

                    accept criticism and even encourage people to prove
                    you wrong or even offend you. Like the mightiest Klingon

                    and geeks, are always there for you and can give you

                    one day you too will create your magnus opus, and a
                    younger (at least in spirit), more awesome, action hero
                    will displace you as hacker monarch, because they want
                    it more badly than you. And they can be
                    a man or a woman or a group, fact or fiction, animal,
                    vegetable, or mineral, etc. And then you too
                    will become the Hacker monarch emerita and actually
                    feel relieved about all that.
