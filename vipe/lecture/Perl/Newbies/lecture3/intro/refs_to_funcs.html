<h1 class="fcs">1.1 References to Functions</h1>

<p>
Perl allows the programmer to store a reference to a function inside
a scalar value. This variable can later be derefernced in order to
invoke the function with any number of arguments.
</p>

<p>
By using this mechanism, one can implement callbacks, and make sure a wrapper
function can invoke several helper functions which it will treat the same.
</p>

<h2>Closures</h2>

<p>
In perl it is possible to define dynamic subroutines, inside the code of 
the current scope. That scope can be a function or even another dynamic 
subroutine. These subroutines, which are sometimes refered to as closures,
can see all the variables of the scope in which they were declared, even
after the function that created them stopped running.
</p>

<p>
Closures enable the program to pass state information into callbacks that 
do not accept state information, and are generally a very convenient 
mechanism.
