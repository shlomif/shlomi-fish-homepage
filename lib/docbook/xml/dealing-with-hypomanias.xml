            <para>
                I'll discuss some of my experience as a person with Bipolar
                Disorder (or Mania-Depressia), and how I deal with the various
                periods of "hypomania": periods of strong excitement and 
                feelings of self-grandioisity.

    <para>
        The topic in question are 
        <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania">Hypomanias</ulink>,
        which while containing the word "mania" are actually below mania, and 
        the person is still in control to some extent, and, with some 
        awareness, may realise he's in a bad condition.
    </para>

    <para>
        Hypomanias are a variation on 
        <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression">Clinical 
            Depressions</ulink>. The latter are not everyday "I am depressed." 
        depressions, but rather a feeling that one is bad, and being
        consumed with guilt, with a tendency of being less communicative and 
        less able to perform one's responsibilities.
    </para>
    
    <para>
        I probably have <ulink 
            url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">Mania-Depressia</ulink> (or "Bipolar disorder") because I had a 
        single "Great Mania" and a few smaller manias, and have frequent 
        Hypomanias, and have been clinically depressed or clinically anxious 
        at the time. So I'm writing about this from experience.

I spent hours on end solving a single math problem. I kept convincing myself
