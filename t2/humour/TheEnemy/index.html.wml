<latemp_meta_desc "A member of the terrorist organisation “The Organisation” quits, but before he leaves, makes a suggestion that makes his former comrades fight each other to death. Join the now ex‐Member of the Organisation as he embarks on an ego trip, where he tries to prove that A can in fact be not‐A, whether or not Aristotle would agree." />

<p>
It’s a political satire, but one that is universal in its message, and
touches on many aspects of politics, logic and Objectivist philosophy.
</p>

<p>
I originally wrote this story as a way to digest the many things I learned
by reading the <a href="http://www.neo-tech.com/">Neo-Tech</a> material
my father had previously bought. I believe it serves as a pseudo-mathematical
proof that the Hizbullah and similar organizations are as irrational as they
can be.
</p>

<p>
Now it has a sequel in the works: <a href="../RoadToHeaven/">The Road to
Heaven is Paved with Bad Intentions</a>.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Tribbiani">Joey Tribbiani from
the Television show <i>Friends</i></a> - I enjoyed watching <i>Friends</i>
after I graduated from high school, and retrospectively I can say that Joey
was my favourite of the three boys. I believe the character of the ex-Member
of the Organisation drew a lot of inspiration from Friends’ Joey: they are both
naïve and innocent, they both have a positive sense of life, and they both
pretend to be more stupid than they really are.
</p>

<p>
The fact that Joey is a traditional sitcom “stupid-guy” character while the
ex-Member is an ultra-intelligent and ultra-intellectual know-it-all, is
relatively negligible.

much shorter than the existing one and ended up being discarded) was not too
good, and for passing some critique on the first chapter of the second version
which the current version is based on. (Along with his younger brother.)
