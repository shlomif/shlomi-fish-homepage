The TIOBE index is meaningless
</div>
<div class="abstract">
<p>
The
<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.htm?tiobe_index"> TIOBE index</a>
ranks
programming languages.  It claims to be based "on the world-wide availability
of skilled engineers, courses and third party vendors".  But how can they
reliably and automatically mine such infomration using just search engine
results?
</p>
</div>
<div class="body">
<p>
Actually, not only is their data not very reliable, but it is also prone to
"spamming", because search engines are!  And this is why we see a totally
obscure experimental Forth-like language such as "Factor" get in the top 50.
There is only one explanation: the TIOBE index is simply a combination of the
number of results of some search queries at major search engines;  as a handful
of persons regularly post articles about Factor at social bookmarking sites
such as Reddit or at Wikipedia, this artificially inflates their position.
</p>
<p>
The other explanation is that Factor is legitimately getting a lot of web
attention.  But that's absurd, since it doesn't deserve any serious attention.
I mean, it is on the same level as Brainfuck.  Brainfuck is interesting to
programming language geeks.  Factor can be interesting to Forth geeks, or
compilation geeks.  But that's not what TIOBE is about.
</p>
<p>
In the real world, there is no Factor.  It is just a virtually unknown obscure
experimental language with a small fandom that managed to get into a mostly
meaningless index.  You want proof?
</p>
<p>
There is not a single scholarly article about it, not a single PhD about it,
actually not a single known application written in Factor, no single school
giving courses in Factor; in fact, Factor isn't even in the Debian
distribution, while Brainfuck, which is also an obscure language, is.  How many
persons in the world are paid to write Factor code?
</p>
<p>
But then it could be that Factor is the language of the future, and TIOBE is
very good at picking languages of the future?
</p>
<p>
It seems that TIOBE is just very good at picking spamming effort.  Consider the
following important languages, which are not in the top 50.
</p>
<p>
Let's show that the rankings at the TIOBE index do not map to language
importance according to any criteria other than web hype:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
VHDL, an industry-standard hardware description language, is not even in the
top 50.  Verilog isn't even mentioned on the TIOBE page.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ocaml is a well-known, academically developed state-of-the art functional
language that has been around for ten years (and much more if you count its
direct ancestor Caml).  Typing
<code> ocaml OR "objective caml" OR caml</code>
at Google
scholar returns about
<em> ten thousand</em>
results.  Ocaml is also used as a language
in 173 Debian packages, of which 40 are end-user applications (i.e., not
dependencies).  Ocaml has thousands of users, is teached at hundreds of
schools, and has Intel, Dassault Systems and Microsoft in its consortium.  F
#
is an Ocaml derivative for .NET.  Yet, Ocaml is not in the top 50, while the
obscure Factor is.   This simply means that the TIOBE metric is absolutely
meaningless.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Actually there is an ML at position 42, but which ML is that?  SML?  XML?
HTML?  YaML?  But that doesn't include Ocaml, since it's mentioned elsewhere.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Languages which legitimately have buzz around them include Scala, which is
academically developed, and has many posts about it at Reddit.  Still not in
top 50.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The other languages cited in the top 50 are usually vendor-specific languages
of products that have some momentum; for many of those languages, knowledge of
the language is indistinguishable from knowledge of the particular software
product.  And what the hell is
<code> PL fucking I</code>
doing in a 2008 list of the top
50 languages?
</p>
<p>
So, while obscure experimental languages and vendor-specific scripting
frameworks clutter the top 50 list, industrially and academically important
real-world languages such as VHDL, Verilog or Ocaml are relegated to the end or
not mentioned at all.
