<p>
I wrote this patch (itâ€™s actually very short) with a lot of help from
Matthew Wilcox, who is the current maintainer of the filesystem locks
logic in the Linux Kernel. It is made against linux-2.5.30 but should
work with more recent or later versions.

<p>
Without this patch, the Linux kernel discriminates against writers,
and accepts readers into a lock in readers state even if there are
pending writers. The <a href="test_flock.c">following
test program</a> can demonstrate the two behaviours (try running it as
<code>test_flock 20 2</code>).
