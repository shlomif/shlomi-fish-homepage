== Subversion

+* "A compelling version control system".
+* Primarily aimed to solve the shortcomings of CVS:
+** Directories, renames, and file meta-data are versioned.
+** Commits are atomic.
+** Client/server protocol sends diffs in both directions.
+** Costs are proportional to change size, not data size.
+** Efficient handling of binary files.
+** Portable - clients and services run on UNIX and Win32.
----
== Other Advantages

+* Apache network server option, with WebDAV/DeltaV protocol.
+* Standalone server option.
+* Branching and tagging are cheap (constant time) operations.
+* Versioning of symbolic links.
----
== The Subversion Philosophy

+* Subversion - a versioned file system.
+* So the following operations work as expected:
+** svn add
+** svn mkdir
+** svn rm (or delete, remove or del)
+** svn move (or mv)
+** svn copy
----
== How to start using

+* Use "svn checkout" (or "svn co") to checkout a working copy.
+* Use "svn commit" (or "svn ci") to commit your changes.
+* Use "svn copy URL1 URL2" to branch and tag lines of development.
+* *Always put your working copy in a sub-directory of the repository* (usually named trunk), so you can branch and tag it later to a different directory.
