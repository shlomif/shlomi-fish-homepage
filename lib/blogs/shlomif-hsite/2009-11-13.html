The texts of the lists of stories and their descriptions in the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/">Humour page</a> and its
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/">Stories section</a>
were merged, updated and enhanced.
</p>

<p>
There are new
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/">Chuck
    Norris Factoids</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    Chuck Norris is the greatest man in history. He killed all the
    great men who could ever pose a competition.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There’s also a new
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/XSLT/">factoid
    about XSLT</a>:
</p>

    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The text of <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Pope/"><b><i>The
Pope Died on Sunday</i></b></a> was converted to XML-Grammar-Fiction (see below)
and was continued a little. The story is written in Hebrew, and there is still
no English translation.
</p>

<p>
The original
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Blue-Rabbit-Log/">screenplay
    <b><i>The Blue Rabbit’s Log</i></b></a> has new text and its ideas page has
also been updated:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    [ Mordox disappears. The Blue Rabbits arrive. Bryte sees Galku who
    tries to look innocent, but Bryte rushes to him and lifts him up in
    the air.  ]
    </p>
    <p><strong class="sayer">Clover:</strong> you, where’s Mordox? Tell us
    what you know!</p>

    <p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> What are you looking at me? I’m
    completely innocent!
    </p>
    <p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> See no incredible selfishness and
    total in-consideration of everybody
    else’s welfare and interests. Hear no incredible selfishness and total
    in-consideration of everybody else’s welfare and interests.
    </p>
    <p><strong class="sayer">Bryte:</strong> you mean “See no evil - hear
    no evil”?</p>
    <p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> I knew it was a good definition.
    </p>

</blockquote>

<p>
There’s also some new text in
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">Star
    Trek: <b>“We, the Living Dead”</b></a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    [ Katie is sitting on a table in DS9. She is busy writing something on a
    qwerty-like keyboard attached to a small text pad. Jake approaches her. ]
    </p>
    <p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> Katie, oh there you are. I thought
    that OTF-1 left DS9 already.
    </p>
    <p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> yes, it did, I’m still
    technically working for them.
    </p>
    <p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> really, how?
    </p>
    <p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> with the marvels of technology:
    remote access and Q-ness.
    </p>
    <p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> Q-ness?

    </p>
    <p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> yes, check this out.
    </p>
    <p>
    [ Katie stands up, makes a gesture with her hand. A portal appears near the
    ground showing a different part of DS9. She steps into it, and the portal
    closes. A few moments later, a normal Star-Trek door opens and Katie steps
    out of it. ]
    </p>

    <p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> tada!</p>
    <p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> wow! So you are now “Qatie” with a
    Q?</p>
    <p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Qatie
    <span class="inlinedesc">[with a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qoph">Qoph</a> sound]</span>
    heh, I like it.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">The XML sources of the
    <b>fortunes cookie files</b></a> are now viewable as HTML from the web, and
naturally, there are newer entries.
</p>

<p>
There’s <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/art/slogans/#wdym">a new design
for graphics</a>
based on an old aphorism of me.
</p>

<p>
There’s now a
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/XML-Grammar/">page for
    the Web-CPAN <b>XML-Grammar</b> meta-project</a>, which aims to create
re-usable XML grammars and related tools for various purposes, and there’s a
page for
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/XML-Grammar/Fiction/">the
    XML-Grammar-Fiction module</a> for writing works of prose.
</p>

<p>
The page design and layout were slightly improved with some important
links at the bottom (Web 2.0-style), old cruft removed from the left side
bar, and other changes.
</p>
