<A HREF="http://dir.yahoo.com/Arts/Humanities/Philosophy/Objectivism/"><H3>Yahoo's Objectivism Branch</H3></A>

<p>
I became very interested in Objectivism in the past few years, so I recommend
you take a look. Objectivism is a school of philosphy that deals with politics,
ethics, law, and art. It has a human and freedom centered philosophy,
yet is very strong and uncompromising.
</p>

<p>
The Yahoo branch is a good place to start looking for Objectivist resources
on the web, and there is a lot of introductury material there.
</p>

<BR><BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.neo-tech.com/"><H3>The Neo-Tech Homepage</H3></A>

<p>
"Neo-Tech" is an extension of Objectivism that I also became familiar with. It has
some substancial additions over Objectivism. For example, it integrates
psychology and business advisory into the philosphy.
</p>

<p>
Neo-Tech is commercial, but the material on the web-site is quite good
to get a thorogough understanding. If you are more serious about it, 
you are recommended to order "The Neo-Tech Discovery", the main book of 
Neo-Tech by (snail) mail.

<A HREF="http://www.linux.org/"><H3>The Linux' Homepage</H3></A>
<A HREF="http://www.iglu.org.il/"><H3>The Israeli Group of Linux User's</H3></A>

To say that I'm interested in computers would be like saying that Albert Einstein
was a <B>good</B> physicist. Having cought the UNIX bug on one of my previous jobs
, I am still keeping and experiencing with Linux on my home computer. Linux is
a free UNIX-compatible operating system available for PCs and other machines. I
recommend it to anyone who wants to experiment with UNIX on his PC.<BR>

The Linux' homepage contains most of the information you'll need to know about
the Linux operating system. I'm also a member of the Israely Linux User's Group,
which is the local Linux mailing list and users' "guild".<BR>

<BR><BR>

<a href="http://www.JoelOnSoftware.com/"><h3>Joel on Software</h3></a>

<p>
Joel Spolsky is an experienced Information Technology worker who maintains
a site in which he expresses his bold opinions regarding software
engineering and its distribution. I don't agree with everything he says
there, but some of his articles are very enlightening.
