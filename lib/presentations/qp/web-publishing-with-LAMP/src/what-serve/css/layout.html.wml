<div style="float : right; background-color : #E0E0E0">
<p>
This is an example for a floaty.

The W3C recommends using CSS2-based layout instead of the traditional
table-based layout.

The problem is that while some things are much simpler with CSS 2. (for 
instance, the floaty on this page.), some simple table-based layouts
are incredibly hard. (especially to get to work on all browsers)

CSS positioning is (IMHO) complicated. I was not able to get the complete hang 
of it. You can play with it, or try to consult the 
<a href="http://www.css-discuss.org/mailman/listinfo/css-d/">CSS-d 
mailing list</a>, until it seems right.
(just don't forget to test on all browsers).
