This is a quote from the Television series

Most philosophers at ancient times (and similar phenomena such as
the Israelite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevi%27im">nev'im</a>)
were essentially a form of entertainers. I suspect "le-nabé" meant
"to be crazy / to act crazy" including in today's casual sense.
These philosophers
were treated with the same contempt as we now treat actors, models or most
recently (as of 2014) — reality T.V. show contestants, or independent
(covers/parodies/remixes/etc.) artists on YouTube and other social media and
Web resources (e.g.: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber">YouTubers</a>).
</p>

<p>
Many philosophers were joking and didn't take their philosophies seriously.
They were often <a href="[% base_path
%]humour/fortunes/paul-graham.html">amateur</a> (= artists or workers who enjoy
their work, regardless of how much or how little they were paid; a.k.a:
"geeks") and polymaths, who accepted different opinions, or people who built,
parodied, and expanded upon their work.
</p>

<p>
I suspect that despite what Jaynes describes in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology)">his book</a>,
most of the good nev'im and story tellers of ancient times were only <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania">hypomanic</a> (= mildly manic)
at worse, or possibly manic, who satirised fanatical or cynical zealots, often
spoke in prose, drama or freeform verse, and were in effect "stand-up
comedians".
