Hi all, and welcome to the personal website of
<a href="personal.html"><b>Shlomi Fish</b></a>. I
am an Israeli writer of stories, articles, essays, and
presentations, and a professional software developer (which I find is
a necessary means to the end of writing, blogging, and online and offline
entertainment).
</p>

[% IF 0 %]

I love <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Emma-Watson/">Emma Watson</a>
and <a href="https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Eliza_Dushku">Eliza Dushku</a>
and wish to chat online with either one or both - see my contact page.

You can explore the site using the <a href="#navbar"><b>navigation bar</b></a>
to the left. Alternatively, you can traverse it page-by-page using the
<b>arrows at the top</b>. There’s also <a href="#news">a <b>news feed</b></a>
for what is new on the site, which is updated periodically.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the resources you can find here:
</p>

[% WRAPPER h3_section href = "humour/" id = "humour" title = "Humour" %]

<p>
You can read many <a href="[% base_path %]humour/bits/">shorter “bits” (= short
stories, screenplays, or parodical songs that are usually just a few pages)</a>
I have written, a <a href="[% base_path %]humour.html">collection</a> of
original aphorisms and quotes,
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/bits/facts/">factoids</a> about people
and things (Chuck Norris/etc.), and
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/fortunes/">a large collection of quotes</a> by
myself and others.
</p>

<p>
If you do not lack the patience for reading longer texts, you can read
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/stories/">large-scope humorous
stories (novellas) and screenplays</a>, which I have written.
</p>

[% END %]

[% WRAPPER h3_section href = "philosophy/" id = "philosophy" title = "Articles and Essays" %]

<p>
You can read various essays and articles I wrote about politics, software
development and software management, popular culture, the Internet,
psychology, and ideology.
</p>

[% BLOCK old_essays_description %]
<p>
I am <a href="philosophy/politics/define-zionism/">a Jew and an Israeli</a>
by nationality, an agnostic by faith (or lack of it), and <a
href="philosophy/philosophy/guide-to-neo-tech/">a “Neo-Tech”
Objectivist</a> by ideology. (Objectivism
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/fortunes/shlomif-fav.html#neo-tech-selfishness">does
not imply selfishness</a>, by the way, but rather rational self-growth.)
My expertise as a software developer (in many fields), and my interest
in philosophy, history, software management, and other fields also provide
fodder for my essays and articles.
</p>
