<p>
This is a parody about Ayn Rand's novel, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead">"The 
Fountainhead"</a>, modelled around a two part episode of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends">the 
Television show "Friends"</a>. 
</p>

<p>
I consider this piece my funniest yet.

<define-tag reviews>
A friend of mine who read the book, but didn't watch "Friends" found this
piece highly entertaining. Moreover, an English lady I've been talking with
online, who likes Friends and hasn't read the book yet, also liked reading
this creation of mine. So it is probably good enough for people who are 
familiar with only one of the two sources of inspiration.

This work was enjoyed by people who were only familiar with either the
Fountainhead or the Friends T.V. show.
</p>

<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>

<p>
Well, since this work is a parody of The Fountainhead (written by Ayn Rand
and now still kept by the Ayn Rand estate), and contains characters from there,
I am theoretically protected by the Copyright's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use#Fair_use_and_parody">"right of 
parody"</a> as part of "Fair Use". There are other parodies of Ayn Rand works
online and possibely offline, and no one was sued yet.
</p>

<p>
However, I have used characters and concepts from the T.V. show "Friends",
and while some parts of my work parody the show in some respect, I consider
it as an ordinary fan-fiction work of Friends, rather than as a parody of it. 
As a result, I consider it a derivative work of Friends, which, like it or not 
and according to the contemporary Copyright Law, may mean it is encumbered by
the claims of its copyright holders. Again, I've seen other fan fiction of
Friends around the Net.

All the text in "The One with the Fountainhead" is original, and as far as
I'm concerned can be used under the terms of
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">the Creative Commmons
Attribution-ShareAlike licence Unported (CC-by-sa), either version 3.0, or at
your option any later version</a>, but like I said, the situation is
more complicated than that.
</p>

<p>
I'm putting it here on this site in hope it will amuse or inspire
people, and also because it may encourage people to read the Fountainhead, or
watch some episodes of Friends, both of which I can highly recommended. I'm not
charging people any money to download, build, or view the works, but I
have some web-commercials which I'm making some small money from, and whicih
I hope are acceptable to the copyright holders. Please don't sue me.
