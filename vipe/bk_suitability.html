        <h1>The Suitability of BitKeeper and bkbits.net for Free Software Projects</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
        The purpose of this document is to analyze how suitable are
        of <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.com/">BitKeeper</a> and the
        <a href="http://bkbits.net/">bkbits.net</a> hosting service offered by 
        BitMover (BitKeeper's parent company), for use by free software 
        projects.        
        </p>

        <p>
        I, Shlomi Fish, am a former user of BitKeeper and the BKBits.net 
        service, a user of other revision control tools such as CVS and 
        <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>, and the
        founder of the "Better SCM" initiative.
        </p>

        <h2>The Technical Merits of BitKeeper</h2>

        <p>
        BitKeeper itself is a very feature-rich, powerful and impressive
        product, and free users receive access to its full capabilities. For
        my limited use of it for <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lm-solve">LM-Solve</a>, which is a very small-scale project, it worked very well,
        but naturally, I did not stress test it. Nevertheless, the Linux kernel
        developers probably stress test it enough, which proves BitKeeper 
        scales for large-scale projects.
        </p>

        <p>
        The free use of BitKeeper requires that the comments attached to the
        changesets be sent by E-mail to 
        <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.com/v2_logging/">OpenLogging</a>. This
        should not be a problem for most developers of publicly hosted 
        Open-Source projects as they expect the history of the project in
        the repositories to be publicly available anyways. (there is a
        small amount of added network traffic, however)
        </p>

        <h2>The Support Offered for BitKeeper</h2>

        <p>
        As someone who relied on the BitKeeper support to ask some questions
        on BitKeeper and to receive support for some initial problems
        I had in setting it up, I can say that Larry McVoy and the other 
        BitMover employees, are in general very friendly and helpful 
        to free users. I strongly recommend free users to ask questions at
        the 
        <a href="http://www.bitmover.com/mailman/listinfo/bitkeeper-users">bitkeeper-users mailing list</a> and not at the support E-mail which is intended 
        mainly for paying customers. (that was a mistake I made due to the
        fact that the BitKeeper web-site was not very clear about it). Note
        that bitkeeper-users is dedicated for technical discussions of the 
        product and political comments should be kept off it. (another mistake
        I made)
        </p>

        <h2>The BitKeeper License</h2>

        <p>
        The BitKeeper License, however, is not very suitable or acceptable for 
        most Open-Source developers. An old Linux Weekly News editorial I read
        about it described the fact that a few years ago BitKeeper was almost 
        free software except for the necessity to keep the OpenLogging feature.
        Since then, its source code is no longer publicly available and the
        license has been changed several times. Sometimes it was made less
        restrictive, but often quite the opposite.
        </p>

        <p>
        I kept LM-Solve on BKBits, but I also kept several layouts of logic
        mazes I found on the <a href="http://www.logicmazes.com/">Logic Mazes
        site</a> and similar sites, so users of the program could feed
        the solver with them. These mazes were copyrighted by Robert Abbott and
        others and as far as I knew were not free content. (naturally, they 
        were distributed as a separate package, with an appropriate notice
        explaining who originated and owned them)
        </p>

        <p>
        A few monthes ago, Larry McVoy decided to <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/8717/">change the license</a>. Apparently, he was worried that some users
        of BitKeeper did not put anything meaningful in the comments sent to 
        Open-Logging. Thus, he required that the code be made available under a 
        free software license. Naturally, I could not do it for the mazes
        layout I transcribed, without asking for permission from their respective
        owners. Plus, <b>I</b> did not do anything wrong: my project was hosted
        on BKBits.net, it was free software, and my comments were perfectly 
        meaningful. Nevertheless, I could no longer host it there.
        </p>

        <p>
        I still wanted to toy with BitKeeper afterwards, but then I discovered
        the license had previously changed to make sure a BitKeeper user cannot
        work on competing revision control systems. Since I was planning
        to contribute to an open-source (which I have already did since then)
        I could no longer legally use it. This has been slashdotted and in
        one of the comments a Slashdot reader claimed he used BitKeeper until a
        few years ago when the license was changed and made him unavailable to
        use it any longer. So, I'm not alone.
        </p>

        <p>
        The unavailability of the source code also made my life harder. At once,
        I suggested to Mr. McVoy and Co. that BitKeeper would cache the 
        OpenLogging comments and send them after many were collected. That way,
        the Technion's relatively poor connection to the Internet backbone 
        would not be constantly flooded with E-mail messages, should it adopt
        BitKeeper system-wide. I believe he implictly agreed it would be a 
        good idea. I thought about implementing it myself and sending him the 
        patch, but I evidently discovered that I could not in a straightforward
        way.
        </p>

        <p>
        The pattern is here clear: by restricting the availability and license 
        of BitKeeper, BitMover harms perfectly valid users who are happily 
        using BitKeeper, and wish to contribute to its development by feedback
        , help for newbies or even code. It is all done in order to prevent
        a minority of abusers from abusing BitKeeper, and despite the fact 
        that I seriously doubt that they would have become paying customers one
        way or the other.
        </p>

        <p>
        The BitKeeper gratis license clearly specifies that one should upgrade
        to the new version of BitKeeper and not use the old one for production
        work, even if a change of license has occurred. This has a very 
        disturbing UCITA feel to it.
        </p>

        <p>
        In short, the BitKeeper license is not suitable for use by most open-
        source developers, even if they are not "idealistic" enough to 
        refrain from using a package that deviates from the Open Source 
        Definition, and the Free Software Definitions so much. It is simply
        way too restrictive.
        </p>

        <h2>The BKBits.net Hosting Service</h2>

        <p>
        As opposed to the license, the BKBits.net hosting service is very 
        good. It is discrete, reliable and useful. Starting a
        project requires some RTFMing, but otherwise no intervention on the
        part of BitMover's employees. I never lost data using it, and the
        connectivity from the Technion and from my home ADSL connection was
        very fast and good. (again - I did not stress-test it).
        </p>

        <p>
        The main caveat here is that you have to make sure you don't make 
        Larry McVoy (the person) angry. He is known to take comments about the
        licensing and what he considers abuse of his service very harshly,
        and wants people to leave him alone.
        </p>

        <h2>Verdict</h2>

        <p>
        As can be seen, the only bad point here is the license. But the license
        is the most important factor that determines the success of a 
        <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FiveWorlds.html">"shrinkwrap"</a>
        software project. We all know how the AT&amp;T licensing of System V
        has done more harm to UNIX than Microsoft could have done alone. We all
        know how the Linux Kernel GPL license gave it an unbeatable edge 
        over the BSDs. I can tell from my experience that my own pet project,
        has become a category killer because it was distributed from the start
        as Public Domain, instead of GPL or simply proprietary license in the 
        case of its many alternatives. (thus making it accessible for many 
        Freeware and Shareware programs which would like to use it as an API)
        </p>

        <p>
        BitKeeper fails miserably here, at least as far as free software
        developers are concerned. Many free software developers are too 
        idealistic to use something like that. That was not the case for me
        when I started using BitKeeper, and I got burned in the hands from 
        using it. I still remember having liked it a lot and being very 
        impressed by its capabilities. But it has become inaccessible for
        me and now I grew to like Subversion too, and use it for all my work 
        (including writing this very document). It does not have all of 
        BitKeeper's features but is very usable, and I'm impressed by its
        architecture as well. I recommend every developer to look into some
        of the available alternatives to CVS (CVS is limited in many ways),
        before they settle on using it. The main reason I started using
        BitKeeper was because it offered an attractive free-of-charge public 
        hosting service. If the same existed for Subversion, I would probably
        have used it instead.
        </p>

        <p>
        Here, the ball passes to the court of the Hosting Services. Setting
        up hosting of an alternative to CVS (which many times is much more 
        straightforward to manage than CVS, which is known as very insecure by 
        default) will practically make sure no free software developer except
        perhaps the Linux kernel developers will use BitKeeper out of his own 
        free will. Other than that, it is obvious that the limitations of CVS
        and the alternatives to it are the talk of the day in several online 
        forums I frequently visit.
