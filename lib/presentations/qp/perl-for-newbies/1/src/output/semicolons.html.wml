#include 'template.wml'

<p>
A perl program can naturally include more than one command. To do so, you
need to place a semicolon at the end of each command or otherwise the
interpreter will be confused.
</p>

<p>
It is not enough to put each command on a separate line. In fact it's not
even necessary. The following two programs are equivalent:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/output/oftf1.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
and
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/output/oftf2.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
However, for readability and easy debugging it is recommended that each
statement will be on a separate line. And sometimes it's helpful to span
one on more than one line.
