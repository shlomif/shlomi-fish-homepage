The RWLock will use a queue. Each element of the queue will contain
a condition variable and a flag that indicates if it contains a reader
or a writer pending.

The RWLock will contain a counter that tells it how many readers are using
it at the moment (num_readers), and a flag that specifies if there's a
writer using the lock (is_writer). It also uses a common internal mutex
to protect against mutual exclusion (mymutex)

Algorithm:

accept_pending_items:
---------------------

Extracts the first element out of the queue.

If it is a writer, it sets is_writer to 1, and signals the condition
variable of the element.

If it is a reader, it sets is_writer to 0, and polls+extracts
all the other items out of the head of the queue that are readers
(i.e it stops at the first writer or at the end of the queue).

get_write_access:
-----------------

locks mymutex.

Checks if is_writer is set or num_readers is greater than 0. If so,
it enqueues itself. (the mutex of the condition variable is mymutex)

If not it sets is_writer to 1.

Unlocks the mutex.



get_read_access:
----------------

locks mymutex.

If the queue is empty and is_writer is false it increments num_readers and unlock mutex.

Else it enqueues itself, while using mymutex for waiting on the condition variable. When the condition variable is signalled, num_readers is incremented by 1.

Unlocks mutex.

release_write_access:
---------------------

locks mutex

Sets is_writer to false. Then calls accept_pending_items.

unlocks mutex

release_read_access:
--------------------

locks mutex

Decrements num_readers. If num_readers == 0 it calls accept_pending_items.

unlocks mutex
