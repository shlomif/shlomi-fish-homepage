[The Muppet Show Theatre backstage. Kermit and Fozzy are there.

ChuckN enters through the door.
]

Kermit: Oh hello, Mr. Norris. We’re so glad to have you here and we would
love to learn more about you.

ChuckN: Thank you, Kermit. You can learn more about me from my 500-page
autobiography, which took me an hour to write, and from the comprehensive
book of Factoids about me, of which I wrote every one.

Fozzy: Funny! Funny!

ChuckN: Indeed. Any way, I invited a friend who is even crazier than I am.

Kermit: Really, who is this crazy guy?

ChuckN: Actually, it’s a crazy girl.

[SGlau jumps from above to the upper row and then down to where Kermit
and Fozzy are standing. Applause.]

Kermit: Oh, nice to see you here, Ms. Glau.

SGlau: shut up, Mr. Frog! I’m here on a mission from the Grammar God. Herr
Norris and I are loyal servants of Grammar Nazism, which aims to unite Grammar
Europe under the reign of the Third Grammar Reich. Hail Grammar!

ChuckN: Hail Grammar [together with SGlau].
