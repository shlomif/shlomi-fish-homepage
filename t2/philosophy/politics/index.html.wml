<latemp_subject "Shlomi Fish' Writings about Politics" />

<p>
These are essays that deal with Politics, but from the Philosophical side.
They're not more of the "Left-vs-Right" rehash, but rather aim to provide 
fresh point-of-views and new insights. They may prove controversial for both
Left-winged and Right-winged people.
