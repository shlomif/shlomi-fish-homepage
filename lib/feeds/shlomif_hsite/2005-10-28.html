<!-- TITLE=New Changes for 28-October-2005-->
<p>
Since the last update to its changes log, 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish’s personal site</a>
has seen a great deal of changes. Here is a list of the most major ones:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/personal.html">The Bio Page</a> was 
sectioned into several headings, and more links and material were added.
</li>
<li>
The old <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/wonderous.html">“Wonderous are
the Ways of Microsoft”</a> humorous (but real) bit was integrated into
the common look and feel of the site, and re-linked from there.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/">An index page</a>
was created for the stories as part of the global humour section.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/links.html">The Links Page</a> was heavily
re-organized and expanded. Now, each one of its section has an anchor for 
easy linking to that part of the page.
</li>
<li>
A New Essay - 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/open-source/gpl-bsd-and-suckerism/">“The
GPL, the BSD License and Being a Sucker”</a> was added. It aims to dispel
the common belief that one is being a sucker by releasing open source 
software under non-<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">GPL</a> 
licenses.
</li>
<li>
A New Essay - 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/case-for-file-swapping/">“The 
Case for File Swapping”</a> was added. This essay touches upon the many points
of the Internet sharing and downloading of files (including media files such as
music files or video), and dispels most of the myths about why it’s illegal or
immoral.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I still have several new essays in the pipe, and I also need to do some
cleanups to the site. One enhancement will also involve tweaking the 
site flow engine that is used by the site.
</p>

<p>
But until then - enjoy!
