I adopted the
<a href="http://mikmod.raphnet.net/"><b>libmikmod and mikmod</b>
project</a> from
its previous maintainer, Raphaël Assénat, who passed the baton to me.
MikMod is a player for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_file">module files</a>, which
are a group of several related formats of music files.
</p>

<p>
Previously, I had written <a href="[% base_path %]jmikmod/">MikMod for Java</a>,
which is a port of an old version of MikMod to the Java programming language
and the JVM.
