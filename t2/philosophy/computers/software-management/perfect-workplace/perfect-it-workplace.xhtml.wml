<latemp_subject "The Perfect IT Workplace - Revision 1" />

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
This is the text of first revision of the my essay "The Perfect IT Workplace".
This page got <a 
href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/info/6p9rd/comments/">posted 
to reddit</a> by a fellow software enthusiast whom I referred to it and
which he liked. I did not intend to publicse this particular draft, but
I'm OK with it publicisied as is and would just work on the second revision
now which will be better publicised.
