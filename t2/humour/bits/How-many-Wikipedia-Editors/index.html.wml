<p>
The main inspiration for this document has been the document
<a href="$(ROOT)/humour/by-others/how-many-newsgroup-readers-does-it-take-to-change-a-lightbulb.html">"How Many Newsgroup Readers does it Take to
Change a Lightbulb?</a> whose origins are unknown. Some of my recent exposure
to being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Shlomif">a 
Wikipedia contributor</a> inspired me to create an adaptation of
this to the world of the English Wikipedia. Note that I still find Wikipedia
an indispensible resource and enjoy contributing to it, and approve of it
as a whole, despite the many problems that it constantly faces in 
its daily maintenance (and is mostly handling them mostly fine).
