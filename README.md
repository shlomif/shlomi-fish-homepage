[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shlomif/shlomi-fish-homepage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shlomif/shlomi-fish-homepage)

This repository contains the sources for Shlomi Fishâ€™s Homesite ( http://www.shlomifish.org/ ), which
is mostly a [generated static site](https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-tech-diary/blob/master/static-site-generators--despair.md).

For build instructions see the file [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md), which may be
somewhat out-of-date as documentation goes, so you may prefer perusing the
[Travis-CI configuration](./.travis.yml) and [status](https://travis-ci.org/shlomif/shlomi-fish-homepage).
As some wise men said before, ["Use the source, Luke!"](https://blog.codinghorror.com/learn-to-read-the-source-luke/).

There's [a todo list](./TODO.quicktask) which is maintained using
the Vim quicktask plugin - https://github.com/aaronbieber/vim-quicktask ,
and one can also use GitHub Issues.
