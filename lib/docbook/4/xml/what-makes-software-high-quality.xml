                This document will discuss what makes an open source program
                (and by induction other programs) high-quality. It will cover
                the parameters that make software applications high-quality
                and ways to achieve them.

    <para>
        What is a high-quality software application? I'm not talking about the
        application
        that's the most hyped, or the fastest, most featureful, or best. You
        can often hear endless rants and
        <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt">Fear,
            Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)</ulink> attacks about it. Often, it
        has competing programs that are superior in many respects. But at
        the end of the day, it is one of the most popular programs out there
        and is what many people like to use, what they find as the right
        tool for the job, and often what they are told (or even forced)
        to use.
    </para>
    <para>
        How did I think about it? I am active in the
        <ulink url="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/">fc-solve-discuss
            mailing list</ulink>,
        which is dedicated to computerised techniques for solving
        <ulink url="http://www.freecell.org/">the Freecell solitaire card
            game</ulink>, and for discussing other automated solving
        and research of Solitaire games. This mailing list was started after
        I wrote
        <ulink url="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</ulink> (with
        a lowercase "c" and an uppercase "S"), an open-source solver,
        which has proven to be quite popular. However, this mailing list
        was not restricted to discussing it exclusively, and was joined
        by many other Freecell solving experts, researchers and enthusiasts.
    </para>
    <para>
        Later on, I lost interest in Freecell Solver, and have only been
        fixing bugs in the latest stable version (2.8.x). Since
        it is open source, and with an aim to be a
        <ulink url="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">Bazaar-like
            project</ulink> I welcome <ulink url="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/current-status.html">other people to take over</ulink> and am willing to help
        them,
        but it is still very functional as it is.
    </para>
    <para>
        Recently, <ulink url="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/741">this message</ulink> was written by Gary Campbell, who wrote:
    </para>
    <blockquote>
        <para>
            I think the solver discussion in the Wikipedia should mention that
            the FCPro solvers give quite lengthy and virtually unusable
            solutions. No human wants to follow the several hundred steps that
            usually result in order to get at what's really required to solve a
            given layout. If someone wants a solution that can be understood,
            they want one that is under 100 steps.  This is a major
            contribution and it should be stated. There are a lot of
            <emphasis role="bold">"toy"</emphasis>
            solvers and only a very few of <emphasis role="bold">"industrial strength."</emphasis>
            One of the
            latter is the solver by Danny Jones. I don't see that on your list.
            The results he has gotten from his solver pretty much put your
            solver to shame. The more you hype Freecell Solver, the more
            criticism you open yourself up to.
        </para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>
        Unfortunately, it's hard for me to determine what "industrial
        strength", "enterprise grade" and other such buzzwords are. But I'll
        try to define high quality here, and try to show when a program
        is high quality, and when it is not exactly the case.
    </para>
    <para>
        I initially wanted to give some examples for software that I considered
        to be of exceptional high-quality, but I decided against it. That's
        because it is a matter of taste if this is the case for them, and
        since it may provoke too much criticism against this essay as a
        whole. Thus, I'll just give some examples, possibly accompanied by
        screenshots, of places where one program does something better than
        a different program, while not even implying that the latter is in
        fact lower-quality in all possible respects.
    </para>

<section id="parameters-of-quality">
    <title>Parameters of Quality</title>
    <para>
        This section will cover the parameters that make software high
        quality. However, it will not cover the means to make it so. These
        include such non-essential things as having good, modular code
        <footnote id="good_code" label="having_good_code">
            <para>
                What? Shouldn't high quality software have a good codebase.
                Surprisingly no. What would you prefer: having a very modular
                codebase that does something pretty useless like outputting
                the string "Hello World" <emphasis role="bold">or</emphasis>
                having a large codebase of relatively low quality with a
                large amount of useful functionality and relatively few bugs?
            </para>
            <para>
                I would certainly prefer the other alternative. That's because
                I know I can always refactor that codebase, either by
                <ulink url="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000348.html">large
                    scale refactoring</ulink> or by continuous refactoring
                or even "Just-in-Time" refactoring, only to add a new feature.
            </para>
        </footnote>
        good marketing, or having good automated tests. These things are
        definitely important, but will be covered only later, and a lot
        of popular, high-quality software lacks some of them, while its
        competition may do better in this respect.
    </para>
    <section id="software_is_available">
        <title>The Program is Available for Downloading or Buying</title>
        <para>
            That may seem like a silly thing to say, but you'll be surprised
            how many times people get it wrong. How many times have you seen
            web-sites of software that claim that the new version of the
            software (or even the first) is currently under work, will change
            the world, but is not available yet? How many times have you heard
            of web-sites that are not live yet, and refuse to tell people
            exactly what they are about?
        </para>
        <para>
            Alternatively, in the case of the "Stanford checker", which is
            a sophisticated tool for static code analysis, it is not available
            for download, but instead is a service provided by its parent
            company.
        </para>
        <para>
            A software should be available in the wild somehow (for downloading
            or at least buying) so people can use it, play with it, become
            impressed or unimpressed, report bugs, and ask for new features.
            Otherwise it's just in-house software or at most a service, that
            is not adequate for most needs.
        </para>
        <para>
            In the "Cathedral and the Bazaar", Eric Raymond recommends
            <ulink url="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html">to
                "release Early and release Often"</ulink>. Make frequent,
            incremental releases, so your project won't stagnate. If you
            take your project and work on it yourself for too long, people
            will give up.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you have a new idea for a program, make sure you implement some
            basic but adequate functionality, and then release it so people
            can play with it, and learn about it. Most successful projects that
            were open-source from the start have started this way: the Linux
            kernel, gcc, vim, perl, CPython. If you look at the earliest
            versions of them all, you'll find they were very limited if not
            downright hideous, but now they are often among the best of breed.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section id="version_number_indicated">
        <title>The Version Number is Clearly Indicated</title>
        <para>
            Which version of your software are you using? How can you tell?
            It's not unusual to come to a page where the link to the archive
            does not contain a version number, nor is it clearly indicated
            anywhere. What happens if this number was bumped to indicate a
            bug fix. How do you indicate it then?
        </para>
        <para>
            A good software always indicates its version number in the
            archive file name, the opening directory file name, has a
            <literal>--version</literal> command-line flag,
            and the version mentioned in the about dialogue if there is
            one.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section id="source_is_available">
        <title>The Source is Available, Preferably under a Usable
            Licence</title>
        <para>
            Public availability of the source is a great advantage for a
            program to have. Many people will usually not take a look at it
            otherwise, for many reasons, some ideological but some also
            practical. (Assuming there was ever a true ideology that was
            not also practical.) Without the source, and without it being
            under a proper licence, the software will not become part of
            most distributions of Linux, the BSD operating systems, etc.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you just say that your software "is copyright by John Doe.
            All Rights Reserved", then it may arguably induce an inability
            to study its internals (including to fix bugs or add features)
            without being restricted by a non-compete clause, or even that
            its use or re-distribution is restricted. Some software ship
            with extremely long, complicated (and often not entirely
            enforceable) End-User-Licence-Agreements (EULAs) that no-one reads
            or cares to understand.
        </para>
        <para>
            As a result, many people will find a program with a licence that
            is not 100%
            <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free
                and Open Source Software</ulink> - unacceptable. To be truly

                compatible</ulink>, and naturally usable public-domain licences
            such as the modified BSD licence, the MIT X11 licence, or even

                <para>
                    Using a pure-public-domain Licence for your software is
                    problematic because not all countries have a concept of
                    "public-domain", similar to that of the United States,
                    because many people mis-interpret it, and because
                    it is not clear whether software can be licensed under
                    the public-domain to begin with. (And other such issues).
                </para>
                <para>
                    While <ulink url="http://freshmeat.net/browse/197/">quite
                        a lot of important programs has been released under
                        the public domain</ulink>, and they are doing quite
                    fine, they may have some problematic legal implications.
                </para>
                <para>
                    For these reasons, I now prefer the MIT X11 Licence for
                    software that I originated instead of the "public domain".
                </para>
            </footnote>, are even better for their
            ability to be sub-licensed and re-used. This is while licenses that
            allow incorporation but not sub-licensing, like the Lesser General
            Public License (LGPL) are somewhere in between.
        </para>
        <para>
            While some software on Linux has become popular despite being
            under non-optimal licences, many Linux distributions pride
            themselves that the core system consists of "100% free software".
            Most software that became non-open-source, was eventually forked
            or got into disuse, or else suffered from a lot of bad publicity.
        </para>
        <para>
            As a result, a high-quality software has a licence that is the
            most usable in the context of its operation. These licences are
            doubly-important for freely-distributed UNIX software.

    <section id="just_works">
        <title>It "Just Works"</title>
        <para>
            This is a meta-parameter for quality. When people say that
            something "just works", they mean that you don't have to be
            concerned about getting it up and running, not spend too much
            time to learn it, not worry about it destroying data, or have to
            wonder how to troubleshoot problems with it.
        </para>
        <para>
            A program that just works is the holy grail of high-quality
            software. In practice this means several things:

                    example, GNU Arch, an old and now mostly unused

                    empty directories in the repository. This may make both
                    Mercurial and GNU Arch a no-starter for many uses.

            One thing that detracts from a piece of software being
            high-quality is a large amount of dependencies.

            If we take <ulink url="http://plagger.org/">Plagger</ulink>,
            a web-feed mix-and-match framework in Perl (not unlike
            <ulink url="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Pipes</ulink>, but
            predates it), then its <ulink url="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Plagger/">Plagger
                distribution on CPAN</ulink> contains all of its plug-ins
            inside, and as a result requires "half of CPAN" including such
            obscure modules, as those for handling Chinese and Japanese dates.
        </para>
        <para>
            Popular programs like GCC, perl 5, Vim, Subversion and Emacs have
            very few dependencies and
            they are normally included in the package, if necessary to build
            the system. They are all written in very portable ANSI C and POSIX
            and have been successfully deployed on all modern UNIX-flavours, on
            Microsoft Windows and on many other more obscure systems.

        <para>
            While reducing the number of dependencies often means re-inventing
            wheels, it still increases the quality of your software. I'm not
            saying software cannot be high-quality if it has a large amount
            of dependencies, but it's still a good idea to keep it to a
            minimum.

        <title>The Software Has Packages for Most Common Distributions</title>

            Lack of such packages will require installing it from source,

            it packaged it as a source package, with an irregular
            build-process. Since the qmail package had its own unconventional
            idea of directory structure, some of the distributions had to
            extensively patch it. This in turn prevented more mainstream
            patches from being applied correctly to correct the many
            limitations that qmail had, or accumulated over the years due
            to its lack of maintenance.

            tutorial, that I didn't want to read. Most of the other tutorials
            people wrote, became misleading or non-functional as the program

            Vim has an excellent internal documentation system. It's the first

            most people cannot make heads nor tails of it. There is a short

            For example, Subversion has made it a high priority to work
            properly on Windows. On the other hand many of its early
            alternatives, especially GNU Arch, could not work there due to
            their architectures. As a result, many mixed shops, Windows-only
            shops, or companies where some developers wanted to use Windows
            as their desktop OS, could not use Arch. So Arch has seen a very

        <title>Security</title>
        <para>
            A high-quality software is secure. It has a relatively small
            number of security issues, and bugs are fixed there as soon as
            possible.
        </para>
        <para>
            Some people believe that security is the most important aspect
            of software, but it's only one factor that affects its quality.
            For example, once I was talking with a certain UNIX expert, and
            he argued that the Win32 <ulink url="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682425.aspx">CreateProcess() system call</ulink> was
            superior to the UNIX combination of
            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork-exec">Fork()
                and Exec()</ulink>, just because it made some bugs harder
            to code.  However, some multitasking paradigms are not possible,
            without the fork() system call, which is not present in the Win32
            API at all, and needs to be emulated (at a high run-time cost) or
            replaced with thread-based multitasking, which is not identical.
            Finally, it is still possible to get fork()+exec() right, and
            there's a spawn() abstraction on many modern UNIXes.
        </para>

        <para>
            While I don't mean you shouldn't pay attention to security, or
            keep good security practices in mind when coding, I'm saying that
            it shouldn't slow down the process by much, or prevent too many

        <title>Backwards Compatibility</title>
        <para>
            A high-quality program maintains as much <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility">backward
                compatibility</ulink>
            with its older versions as possible. Some backward compatibility,
            like relying on bugs or other misbehaviours
            ("bug-to-bug compatibility"), is probably too extreme to consider.
            But users would like to upgrade the software and expect all of
            their programs to just continue to work.
        </para>
        <para>
            A bad example for software that does not maintain backwards
            compatibility is <ulink url="http://www.php.net/">PHP</ulink>,
            where every primary digit breaks the compatibility with the older
            one: PHP 4 was not compatible with PHP 3 and PHP 5 was not
            compatible with PHP 4. Furthermore, sometimes existing user-land
            code was broken in minor-digit releases. As such maintaining
            PHP code into the future is a very costy process, especially if
            you want it to work with a range of versions.
        </para>
        <para>
            On the other hand, the perl5 developers have been maintaining
            backwards compatibility between 5.000, 5.001, 5.002 up to
            5.6.x, 5.8.x and now 5.10.x. As such one can normally expect older
            scripts to just work. perl5 can also run a lot of perl4 code and
            below, and perl4 code can be ported to modern versions of perl5
            with some ease. While sometimes scripts broke (due to lack
            of "bug-to-bug compatibility"), or became slower,
            upgrading to a new version of Perl is normally straightforward.

        <title>Speed and High Performance</title>
        <para>
            The reason I mentioned this quality parameter so late is because it
            was what Mr. Campbell stressed in his argument about "Industrial
            Strength" Freecell solvers. So I wanted to show that there
            are other important parameters beside it. However, raw performance
            is important, too.
        </para>
        <para>
            If a program is too slow, or generates sub-optimal results, most
            people will be reluctant to use it and find using it daunting.
            They will either give up waiting for it to finish, or get
            distracted. If the output results of the program are too
            sub-optimal (assuming there's a scale to their optimality), then
            they will probably look for different alternatives.
        </para>
        <para>
            As a result, it is important that your software will run quickly,
            and will yield good results. There are many ways to make
            code write faster, and covering them here is out of the scope
            of this article.
        </para>
        <para>
            A good example for how such optimisations can make such a huge
            difference are the
            <ulink url="http://blog.pavlov.net/2008/03/11/firefox-3-memory-usage/">memory optimisations done to Firefox between Firefox 2 and
                Firefox 3</ulink>, which greatly improved its
            performance, memory consumption, and reduced the
            number of memory leaks. It should be noted that often,
            reducing memory consumption can yield better performance because
            of a smaller number of cache misses, process memory swapping,
            and other such factors.
        </para>
        <para>
            There are several related aspects of performance, that also
            affect the general quality and usability of a program. One of them
            is responsiveness, which often manifest as people complain that
            the program is "sluggish". Java programs are especially notorious
            for being such, for some reason, while programs written in
            <ulink url="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</ulink>,
            <ulink url="http://www.python.org/">Python</ulink>, are more
            responsive and feel snappy, despite the fact that their backend
            are generally slower than the Java virtual machine.
        </para>
        <para>
            A tangential aspect is that of startup time. Many programs
            require or have required a long time to start, which also
            makes using them frustrating, even if they are later responsive
            and quick.

    <section id="aesthetics">
        <title>Aesthetics</title>
        <para>
            A good software (or web site) or other resource is aesthetically
            pleasing. Aesthetics in this context, does not necessarily mean
            very "artsy" or having a breath-taking style. But we may have
            run into software (usually one for internal use or one
            of those very costy, bad-quality, niche, software) that seemed
            very ugly and badly designed, with a horrible user-interface,
            etc.
        </para>
        <para>
            Different types of applications, and those running
            on different platforms, have different conventions for what
            is considered aesthetic. In
            <ulink url="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/">The

            Basically, a command line program should output as little as
            possible. Now observe the behaviour of aptitude (a unified
            interface for package management) on Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon, when
            trying to install a non-existing package name:

            of mine, especially given the fact that they are all given
            in the same monotonous default colour.

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <para>
            There are probably several parameters for software quality
            that I'm missing. However, the point is that one should evaluate
            the general quality of the software based on many parameters
            and not exclusively "security" or "speed" or whatever.
        </para>
        <para>
            For example, many proponents of BSD operating systems claim that
            the various BSDs are superior to Linux because they are more
            secure, or because they are (supposedly) faster or are easier
            to manage, because their licence is less problematic than the
            GPL, etc. However, they forget that Linux has some
            advantages like being more popular (and so one can get support
            more easily), or like the fact that its kernel supports much
            more hardware, or that it has better vendor acceptance, and
            because more software is guaranteed to run with less problems
            on Linux than on the BSDs.
            <footnote id="software-only-on-linux" label="linux-bsd-soft">
                <para>
                    Naturally, this is a problem with the fact that most
                    developers are developing on Linux (mostly x86), don't
                    test it on other Unix flavours, and are too careless
                    or unaware to write their programs portably enough.
                </para>
                <para>
                    However, it's still a quality parameter, because it still
                    affects the way you're using the operating system.

            I'm not saying the BSDs are completely inferior to Linux, just
            that Linux still has some cultural and technical advantages.
            Quality in software is not a linear metric, because it is affected
            by many parameters. If you're a software developer, you should
            aim to get as many of the parameters I mentioned right.

        Now that we've covered the elements that make programs high-quality
        here's a non-exhaustive list of ways to actually achieve it. None of
        them are absolutely necessary for achieving the quality, but they
        certainly help a lot.
    </para>
    <para>
        Many people often confuse them with quality. "This software has
        God-damn awful code, so it's a pile-of-crap." Well, what do the users
        care how bad the code is, as long as it is functional, has all the
        necessary features, and is (mostly) bug-free? It's important not
        to confuse quality with the ways to achieve it.

            The more modular a project's code is, the easier it is to
            change it, understand it and extend it, and the faster development
            will take.
            <ulink url="http://www.refactoring.com/">Refactoring</ulink> is
            the name given to the process used to transform code from
            sub-optimal and "ugly", but still mostly functional and bug-free
            code, to a code that is equally functional but more modular
            and clean. See

        <para>
            Automated tests aim to test the behaviour of code
            automatically, instead of manual testing. The classical example
            for them is that if we wish to write a function called
            <literal>add(i, j)</literal> that aims to add two integers
            then we should check that <literal>add(2, 3) == 5</literal>,
            that <literal>add(2, 0) == 2</literal>, that
            <literal>add(0, 2) == 2</literal>, that
            <literal>add(5, -2) == 3</literal>, that
            <literal>add(10, -24) == -14</literal>, etc.
        </para>
        <para>
            Then we can run all the tests and if any of them failed, we
            can fix them. Then after we write or modify the code, we can
            test using them again to see if there are any regressions.
        </para>
        <para>
            Writing automated tests before we write the actual code,
            or before we fix a bug, and accumulating such tests
            (the so-called <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">"Test-driven development"</ulink>
            paradigm), is a good practice which helps maintain
            a high-quality software, and facilitates refactoring
            and makes it safer.

            If you have beta testers for the code, or publish development
            versions frequently, you can get a lot of feedback for various
            different platforms and configurations your code is running
            on. These beta-testers can run the automated tests and also
            use the beta-code for their own testing or even production.

            It certainly helps for the project's communities to have good
            social engineering skills. From tactfulness, to humour, to
            controlling one's temper, to saying "Thanks" and congratulating
            people for their contribution, to timely applying patches and
            fixing bugs - all of these makes contributing to a project
            and using the program more fun and less frustrating.
        </para>
        <para>
            Often, social engineering should be made part of the design of the
            software, or the web-sites dedicated to it. For example, it took
            me several iterations of having to fill the same project form in
            <ulink url="http://savannah.gnu.org/">the
                GNU Savannah software-hub</ulink>, only for it to be

        <para>
            Again, some projects have succeeded despite the fact they

        <title>No Bad Politics</title>
        <para>
            Bad politics in a software project is a lot like
            subjectivity,
            <ulink url="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/52439.html">it
                can never be fully eliminated, but we should still strive
                to reduce it to the minimum.</ulink>. If bad political
            processes become common in a project, then important features are
            dropped, bugs are left unfixed, patches are stalled, external
            projects gets stalled or are killed, people become frustrated or
            angry and possibly leave the project - and the project may
            risk forking.
        </para>
        <para>
            So it's a good idea to keep bad politics at bay and to a minimum.
            How to do that is out of the scope of the document, but it's
            usually up to the leaders to keep it so and maintain a
            good policy that will make as few people as possible frustrated
            and will not flabbergast external contributors. And naturally,
            for open-source and similar projects, a fork is often an option
            in this case, or in other similar cases.

        <title>Good Communication Skills</title>
        <para>
            A project leader and other participants should have good
            communication skills: very good English; pleasantness and tact;
            good phrasing, proper
            grammar, syntax, phrasing and capitalisation; clear writing;
            patience and tolerance; etc. If he doesn't, then the project may
            encounter problems as people will find the project's developers
            hard to understand or tolerate, and, thus, hard to work with.

        <title>Hype</title>
        <para>
            Despite common belief I believe that the less hype and general
            noise there is regarding a software project, the better off
            it is. For example, as <ulink
                url="http://www.paulgraham.com/javacover.html">Paul
                Graham notes regarding Java</ulink>:
        </para>
        <blockquote>
            <para>
                [Java] has been so energetically hyped. Real standards don't
                have to be promoted. No one had to promote C, or Unix, or HTML.
                A real standard tends to be already established by the time
                most people hear about it. On the hacker radar screen, Perl is
                as big as Java, or bigger, just on the strength of its own
                merits.
            </para>
        </blockquote>
        <para>
            In fact, I can argue that if your project receives a lot
            of negative hype, then it is an indication that it is successful.
            Perl, for example, <ulink url="http://perl-begin.org/learn/myth-dispelling/">has
                received (and still receives) a lot of criticism</ulink>,
            and Perl aficionados often get tired of constantly hearing or
            seeing the same repetitive and tired arguments by its
            opponents. However, the perl 5 interpreter is in good shape,
            it has many automated tests (much more than most other competing
            dynamic languages), an active community, many modules on CPAN (
            the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) with a lot of third-party
            , open-source functionality, and relatively few critical bugs. It
            is still heavily actively used and has many fans.
        </para>
        <para>
            Similar criticism has been voiced against
            <ulink url="http://subversion.tigris.org/">the
                Subversion version control system</ulink>,
            Linux, etc. One thing one can notice about such highly-criticised
            projects is that they tend not to be bothered by it too much.
            Rather, what they say is that "If you want to use a competing
            project, I won't stop you. It probably is good. It may be
            better in some respects. I like my own project and that's
            what I'm used to using and use."
        </para>
        <para>
            This is by all means the right policy of "hyping" to adopt, if
            you want your project to be successful based on its own
            merits. Some projects compete for the same niche, without
            voicing too much hype against each other or for them, and this
            is a better indication that they are all healthy.

    <section id="good-name">
        <title>A Good Name</title>
        <para>
            Finally, a project should have a good name. One example for
            a project with an awful name is
            <ulink url="http://www.march-hare.com/cvspro/">CVSNT</ulink>.
            There are two problems with the name:
        </para>
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    It is based on CVS, which most people have ran
                    into its limitations, is considered passé and unloved,
                    and people would rather avoid.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    The "NT" part implies it only runs on Windows-NT, which
                    is both misleading and undesirable.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>
            On the other hand, the competing project "Subversion"
            has a much better name, since it has nothing to do with CVS,
            or Windows NT, and since it is an English word and
            sounds cool.
        </para>
        <para>
            Some projects are successful despite being badly named, while
            some have a very cool name, but languish. Still, a good name
            helps a lot.
        </para>
        <para>
            Also consider what <ulink url="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.unix.pc-clone.32bit/msg/80bb74847934edc7">Linus
                Torvalds said about Linux and 386BSD</ulink> (half jokingly):
        </para>
        <blockquote>
            <para>
                No.  That's it.  The cool name, that is.  We worked very hard
                on creating a name that would appeal to the majority of people,
                and it certainly paid off: thousands of people are using linux
                just to be able to say "OS/2? Hah.  I've got Linux.  What a
                cool name".  386BSD made the mistake of putting a lot of
                numbers and weird abbreviations into the name, and is scaring
                away a lot of people just because it sounds too technical.

            Entire books (and web-sites) were filled with the various
            measures to achieve software quality, and what I described
            here was just a sample of it. The point is that these are
            not aspects of quality by themselves, but rather measures that
            help. None of them is a required or adequate condition for
            the success of a project, but the more are implemented the easier,
            faster, and more enjoying working on the project will be.

            As you recall, Gary Campbell's comment provided the motivation for
            my investigation into what makes a project high-quality and which
            quality-increasing-measures are not elements of quality by
            themselves. And since
            <ulink url="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</ulink>
            has been my pet project, and as I'm still interested in
            techniques for solving Solitaire, I'd like to conclude this essay
            by analysing the various solvers according to the parameters I
            described. The natural caveat is that due to the fact I authored
            a solver of my own, then I may be a bit biased.

            As is not uncommon in many software niches, some Freecell
            solvers are <emphasis role="bold">not commonly
                available</emphasis> for downloading or even for
            buying. For
            example, <ulink url="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/158">Bill
                Raymond's solver</ulink> (named "Cat in the Sack") which he
            has been talking about extensively, has not been released yet,
            under any licensing terms. Similarly, Danny A. Jones has kept his
            solver (mentioned in <link linkend="introduction">the
                introduction</link>) for himself, and has not released it
            to the wild in either source
            or binary forms.
        </para>
        <para>
            As such, the utility of such solvers is heavily reduced. For once,
            they cannot be used as integrated solvers of Solitaire apps,
            because no one is going to wait for an email to the author to be
            sent, and the author to reply with the solution. Also, many
            researchers won't trust solutions given by them without the ability
            to inspect the source code.

            <ulink url="http://www.numin8r.us/programs/">Gary
                Campbell's Solver</ulink> is written in 8086 Assembly, with
            some 32-bit extensions, and only runs on DOS and DOS-compatible
            platforms. The assembly is compiled using a self-hosting
            macro assembler written by Campbell. The Assembly source code
            of the solver or the assembler are not available. As such modifying
            the code of the executable may prove to be problematic.
        </para>
        <para>
            It is tempting to think that x86 and DOS are a very low common
            denominator, but that is not always the case. Imagine that you
            are writing a Freecell game for an embedded device running a
            non-x86 architecture such as
            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</ulink>
            or
            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC">PowerPC</ulink>.
            In that case, in order to run Campbell's solver, you'll need to
            embed an x86-and-DOS emulator (such as
            <ulink url="http://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</ulink>) inside the
            device, which will complicate things, consume a lot of memory,
            and slow things down. On the other, an ANSI C-based solver,
            such as Freecell Solver, or Tom Holroyd's Patsolve, can be easily
            made to compile and run there with few if any modifications.
            So they would be preferable.

            Most of the solvers out there are fast, but some are more than
            others. Normally, for solving an individual game on the
            command-line, almost any solver will do, and the only
            cases where such speed matters more is for Solitaire research,
            and for analysing large sets of different games. (see the
            <ulink url="http://www.solitairelaboratory.com/fcfaq.html">Freecell
            FAQ</ulink> for more information).

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <para>
            All things considered, I still feel that Freecell Solver is
            probably the best quality Solitaire solver out there. While
            <ulink url="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/to-do.html">it still
                has a lot of room for improvement</ulink>, the rest of
            its competition have much bigger issues, or have not been
            made available (yet or ever).
        </para>
        <para>
            Several factors contributed for its success: the fact that
            I announced <ulink url="http://freshmeat.net/">many releases
                on Freshmeat.net</ulink>, that I received a lot of input
            from my users and co-developers, that I was determined to
            constantly improve it and work on it, and that I worked on
            creating and maintaining a good web-site and documentation.
        </para>
        <para>
            While most of the contributions of code I received were limited,
            the input from the users of the software proved to be crucial
            for its prosperity. Like I noted earlier, I lost interest in
            working on it (at least temporarily), but still maintain it,
            and feel that it is good enough as it is.

        <para>
            Shlomi Fish was born in Israel in 1977, and has lived there most of
            his life. He is a user, developer, advocate and activist of
            Open Source Software. His greatest single contribution so far in
            this area has been <ulink url="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell
                Solver</ulink>, a Public Domain Library for solving games
            of Freecell and other types of Solitaire. However, he also
            <ulink url="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/">initiated
                several other projects</ulink> and
            <ulink url="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/contributions/">made
                important contributions to projects he did not initiate</ulink>
            some of them very large scale. Recently, most of his contribution
            were
            <ulink url="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/~shlomif">perl distributions
                he uploaded to CPAN</ulink> under his username.
        </para>
        <para>
            Fish's work on Freecell Solver and other open source projects,
            and the fact he is interested in many software management
            techniques has led him to write <ulink url="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/">a
                large number of articles</ulink>, and weblog entries which
            describe his unique views as a developer of mostly
            portable software.
