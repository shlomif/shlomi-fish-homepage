<blockquote>
<p>
Freecell Solver Enterprises™, Inc., on behalf of the Freecell Solver™
development team, is glad to announce the upcoming availability of Freecell
Solver™ Enterprise Edition. In its Enterprise Edition, Freecell Solver™ will be
enhanced to solve generalised Freecell, in which there can be an arbitrary
number of card ranks. Since generalised Freecell is NP-complete, this will
enable using Freecell Solver™’s ingenious, cutting-edge algorithms to solve the
previously hard, provably NP-Complete problems of the Travelling Salesman
problem, Subset sum, Sudoku and Enterprise content management.

Published on 1-April-2010, this bit did not prove to be as popular as I hoped
it will be, but was still a lot of fun.
