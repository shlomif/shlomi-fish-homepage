                        A double album of the first years of my favourite

                        very revolutionary melodies and style.

                    <p>
                        I’ve been a fan of some of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shania_Twain">Shania
                            Twain</a>’s MTV hits, and
                        downloaded them from Peer-to-Peer networks. One day
                        when I went to a local store looking for certain CDs,
                        I saw her “Greatest Hits” compilation. Since I was
                        looking for other CDs, I did not buy it then, but
                        rather went another day and bought Twain’s CD.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The CD did not disappoint me. With some great songs like
                        “Up”, “Come on over”, “Man, I feel like a woman!”,
                        “Any man of mine”, “Party for Two”, and my old
                        favourites “That don’t impress me much”,
                        “You’re Still the One”, and “I’m Gonna Getcha” - this
                        CD is one of
                        my favourites. Shania Twain sings her country, (perhaps
                        pop country) songs in a fun way, and the arrangement is
                        very nice.

                        On the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) someone jokingly
                        said that the empty set is defined as the people who
                        like both Shania Twain and Pink Floyd. So I guess I
                        belong to the empty set.

                        is a wonderful composer and singer. Her
                        atmospheric music (often accompanied by her vocals) is
                        stimulating and exciting. This is a CD that aims to be
                        her best, and it does contain many wonderful tracks:
                        “The Celts” (the opening titles of the documentary
                        show), “Book of Days”, “Orinoco Flow”,
                        “Caribbean Blue” and many other of my favourites.
                        Highly recommended.

                        voices and the Dance/Pop/Rock arrangement is pleasant

                        Bond are a string quartet made out of four hot chicks,
                        who are doing lots of nice crossover classical music.
                        Being a fan of crossover classic and having heard some
                        of Bond’s song, I went to the records store determined
                        to find a Bond song. I found this album, which is
                        very nice.

                        The Arizona Dream Soundtrack is tantalising and
                        moving, with some great tracks. Goran Bregovic seems
                        very talented, and Iggy Pop does the vocals very
                        well. The music is a combination of ethnic Balkan music,
                        with some modern arrangements, and is excellent.

                        6.0 and we received it as a gift. This album has some
                        very nice mostly instrumental tracks, in a
                        “New Age”-like style. The music in this CD is very

                        I downloaded the album
                        <a href="http://harveydanger.com/downloads/">using
                            BitTorrent</a> (a legitimate download) after
                        reading about its online release in
                        <a href="http://linmagazine.co.il/">Linmagazine</a>.
                        After listening to it for the first time, I immediately
                        liked two of its songs (“Wine, Women and Song” and
                        “Little Round Mirrors”). Now I also like two other
                        songs (“Happiness Write White” and “Incommunicado”). And
                        there’s still some songs there which I didn’t digest
                        yet. The arrangement of these songs is excellent, the
                        performance is great, the music is catchy. The lyrics
                        are a bit weird, but I guess that’s why it’s considered
                        as Alternative Pop.

                        U2 are one of my favourite bands and had many hits
                        throughout the eighties and nineties. This collection
                        comprises their best hits. Most of the titles here
                        make for a very good hearing experience, and one can
                        listen to them again and again.

                        This is a CD of music inspired by the Disney movie
                        <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/">The
                            Lion King</a>. It contains some modern arrangements
                        of African-sounding songs, which are inspiring,
                        addictive, and captivating. The CD contains a booklet
                        with the words and their meaning in English.

                        here are not very good, it does contain many gems
                        such as “Dancing Queen”, “Waterloo”,
                        “The Winner Takes it all”, “Super trouper”,

                        “Knowing Me, Knowing You”, and “Money, Money, Money”.
                        As such it is a very good buy.

                        Vangelis is a modern composer who performs some
                        of his works using a synthesiser. His music provides
                        a compelling and moving atmosphere, and draws the
                        listener to the notes and accords. Vangelis excels
                        in both writing the music, and in performing it later
                        on.

                    <p>
                        These albums consist almost entirely of some of his
                        best tracks, and are highly recommended.

                       I always seemed to have had some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Collins">Phil Collins</a> hits
                       that I really liked. So when we bought the CD, I was
                       happy to be able to listen to them on my computer.
                       Aside from the hits that I was familiar with, I ended
                       up finding other tracks that I liked, such as
                       “Both Sides of the Story” or “Dance into the Light”.

                           Girls</a> were a short-lived phenomenon circa
                       1997. An All-girls group that came out of
                       Britain, they were sensationalist, they were fun
                       and they were there.

                       Regardless of everything, I found some great songs in

                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wannabe_(song)">“Wannabe”</a>,

                   <p>
                       They had some other good songs later:
                       “Too Much”, “Stop”, “Spice Up Your Life”, “Goodbye”,
                       and “Viva Forever”, and their <a
