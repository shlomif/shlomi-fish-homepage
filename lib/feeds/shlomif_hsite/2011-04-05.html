<!-- TITLE=New and Improved Stories, Screenplays, Aphorisms and Bits-->
<p>
Here are the recent updates to 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/" rel="nofollow">Shlomi Fish’s
    Homepage</a> since the last update. A long time has passed and there are
many big and small changes, and I hope this summary will compensate for it.
</p>

<p>
There are new English and Hebrew versions of my story,
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/" rel="nofollow"><i>The Enemy
and How I Helped to Fight it</i></a>, and some text was added to the
front page. An even better version is currently being worked on in the
Mercurial repository of the story.
</p>

<p>
There’s new text in the screenplay
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/" rel="nofollow">Star 
Trek: “We, the Living Dead”</a>, in both parts of
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TOWTF/" rel="nofollow">“The One with the Fountainhead”</a> and in the Hebrew story 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Pope/" rel="nofollow">“The Pope died on Sunday”</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[
Cut. End Credits. Phoebe is sitting on the coach reading the Fountainhead.
]
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Phoebe:</strong> wow, I forgot how great the Fountainhead was. So what did Rand do
afterwards?
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Ross:</strong> well, she wrote the screenplay for the movie adaptation of the
Book that starred Gary Copper…
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Phoebe:</strong> oooh, yummy…
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Ross:</strong> yes, well, and then she worked on Atlas Shrugged.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Phoebe:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[in a lyrical fashion]</span> “Atlas shrugged from side to side. ‘Alas, my end is near!’ the lady cried.”
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Monica:</strong> ehmm… Pheebs? That’s “The mirror crack’d from side to side”.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Phoebe:</strong> oh! Ayn Rand wrote “The Mirror Crack’d” too?
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Ross:</strong> no, Phoebe. That was Agatha Christie.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Phoebe:</strong> Oh! Everybody knows that Ayn Rand wrote all of Agatha Christie’s
stories.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Chandler:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[tongue-in-cheek]</span><strong class="bold">I</strong> can totally believe that, Pheebs.

<p>
After an almost complete lack of inspiration since its inception, there are
now new <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Larry-Wall/" rel="nofollow">Larry Wall
Factoids</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Larry Wall <b>does</b> know all of Perl. However, he pretends to be wrong
or misinformed, so people will think he’s not as awesome as he really is.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And as usual, there are also some new <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/" rel="nofollow">Chuck Norris Facts</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Chuck Norris once wrote a 10 million lines C++ program in Microsoft Notepad 
without having to use the backspace key. And it compiled without errors
or warnings, and was 100% bug-free.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There’s now a <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?mode=random" rel="nofollow">script</a> for displaying an individual quote of the 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/" rel="nofollow">UNIX-like
fortune cookies</a> with a random feature.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of fortune cookies, there are some new fortune cookies, and many
of them have fixed typos:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Real programmers use a nice editor and a nice programming
language and get it done in less than O(N!).
</p>

(Vanguard in Freenode’s ##programming)

<p>
Some of the aphorisms now have <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour-heb.html" rel="nofollow">Hebrew translations</a>:
</p>

<blockquote style="text-align:right;direction:rtl;">
<p>
אלהים נתן לנו שתי עיניים ועשר אצבעות, כדי שנקליד פי חמש יותר ממה שאנו קוראים.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, there’s now a <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/ways_to_do_it-heb.html" rel="nofollow">hebrew
    translation</a> of “Ways to do it according to the programming 
languages of the world”:
</p>

<blockquote style="text-align:right;direction:rtl;">
<ul>
<li>
<b>Perl</b> -
יש יותר מדרך אחת לעשות זאת.
</li>
<li>
<b>C++‎</b> -
ישנן חמש דרכים לעשות זאת. שלוש מתוכן לא אמורות לעבוד.
</li>
<li>
<b>Visual Basic</b> -
הדרך היחידה לעשות זאת היא להשתמש ברכיב צד שלישי.
</li>
<li>
<b>ANSI C</b> -
יש, בדרך כלל, דרך אחת לעשות זאת, אבל יש יותר מדרך אחת לבצע אופטימיזציה.
</li>
<li>
<b>Java</b> -
יש בקושי דרך אחת לעשות זאת. (אבל בניגוד ל-C++‎, היא בטוח תעבוד.)
</li>
<li>
<b>Python</b> -
יש דרך אחת לעשות זאת. הדרך האחת האמיתית לעשות זאת. וישנן גם דרכים אחרות.
</li>
</ul>

The funny bit
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/s-stands-for-simple/" rel="nofollow">“The
S Stands for Simple”</a> (about SOAP) is now mirrored on the site. I have also placed
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/oded-c/" rel="nofollow">the stories
by a writer by the name of Oded C.</a> that he had sent me in the past (in 
Hebrew) on the site, and converted them to OpenDocument Text and to HTML using 
<a href="http://openoffice.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenOffice.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/copyrights/" rel="nofollow">The Copyrights Page</a>
now spells out my interpretation of the various Creative Commons licences 
that I’m using:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>The Public Domain / CC-Zero</b></p>

modify it or build upon it, even without giving me credit. If you wish you

caused by using or misusing the information.
</p>
<p>
All of that put aside, if you find works under this licence useful, you
are encouraged to credit me; share them under similar liberal licences;
make a small donation, either in money for me and/or for a good cause,
or by buying me interesting books,
cool T-shirts, or alternatively audio or video files (only as digital
files, for I lack the energy for pesky circular physical media),
and naturally by sending me an appreciation note that you
enjoyed them or found them of value. But I’m not forcing you to.
</p>
<p>
I’m using this licence for most of my photos (but not all of them), for some
of my presentation material, and for some of my old code, or code that
I find useful to dual-licence under it and the MIT/X11 licence.

The <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/japanese-puzzle-games/abc-path/" rel="nofollow">solver</a>
for the game <a href="http://www.brainbashers.com/abcpath.asp" rel="nofollow">ABC Path</a> (by
Otto Janko) is now available in the software section.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/XML-Grammar/Fiction/" rel="nofollow">XML-Grammar-Fiction</a> 
homepage was improved with new content and some links to the similar efforts
of <a href="http://celtx.com/" rel="nofollow">Celtx</a> and <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/" rel="nofollow">AsciiDoc</a>.
</p>

<p>
There’s 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/#evilphish-emblem" rel="nofollow">a new FAQ about
    the “EvilPHish” emblem</a> in the top-left corner of this screen.
</p>

<p>
The technical talk
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Too-Many-Ways/" rel="nofollow">“There
are Too Many Ways to Do it”</a> now contains 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Too-Many-Ways/too-many-ways-hebrew-notes.txt" rel="nofollow">notes 
in Hebrew</a> which have been prepared in advance when giving it to the Tel 
Aviv Perl Mongers.
</p>

<p>
The main navigation menu on the left was revamped and converted
to use JavaScript (which is not required to operate it). I’m planning to do
further work on tweaking it in the near future. Moreover, there’s now
a language switching widget on such pages as
the <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/ways_to_do_it.html" rel="nofollow">“Ways to
do it According to the Programming Languages of the World”</a>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I added 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/personal.html#mental_condition" rel="nofollow">some
description of my psycho-medical condition</a> to my Bio. 
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, you enjoy these changes. More are upcoming.
