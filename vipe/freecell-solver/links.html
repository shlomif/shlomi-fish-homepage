<h2>Resources</h2>
<p class="desc">
Freecell Solver Resources on the Net.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver's BerliOS mirror</a> -
a mirror of the files contained here at the
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de">BerliOS</a> software hub.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/">Freecell Solver's
Mailing-List</a> - a mailing-list dedicated to discussing the usage
and development of Freecell Solver and general techniques for solving
card solitaire games. Hosted by
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/">YahooGroups</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/freecellsolver/">App-Index Record</a>
- the record for Freecell Solver at Freshmeat. You can find there a version
history, a Freshmeat internal hit count, and other useful information.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/Freecell-Solver/">Freecell
Solver Lecture</a> - A lecture I gave to the
<a href="http://linuxclub.il.eu.org/">Haifa Linux Club</a> about the
development of Freecell Solver.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/?group_id=66">BerliOS' Project
Page</a> - contains CVS instructions and other goodies.
</p>
<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p class="desc">
Technologies used by Freecell Solver or that aided in its development.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.msu.edu/user/pfaffben/avl/">libavl</a> - a very nice
library which contains optimized C implementations of an AVL and Red-Black
binary trees. It's GPLed, which means it can only be used by
certain types of Open-Source software.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://libredblack.sourceforge.net/">libredblack</a> - an
ANSI C implementation of a Red-Black tree. Takes some modifications to
compile on Win32. LGPL, so can be used by a code of any license.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.gtk.org/">glib</a> - a C library used by gtk+, which
can also be used separately (as is the case with Freecell Solver). Contains
implementations of a hash, and an unoptimized balanced binary tree. Both
are slower than libavl/libredblack or the internal hash implmentation, and
it is less programmer-friendly.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/jheyesjones/astar.html">The A* scan</a> -
a states graph scan that uses a priority queue for determining which state
to go to next. This page contains some source code, but the explanation
is also very good.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://dmalloc.com/">The dmalloc malloc debugging library</a> -
a library to trace memory leaks. Freecell Solver used to have some of those
in various stages of its development, and this library helped to remove
them. It has a rather awkward output, and I had to use a debugger
interactively to complement it, but it is still quite helpful.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/autoconf/">Autoconf, automake and
libtool</a> - a trio of tools that help maintain a portable building for
a software project across UNIX and similar platforms. Freecell Solver did
not use for a large time, but I switched to it in order to have a portable
way to build it as a dynamically-linked library.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/">Valgrind</a> - a sophisticated
memory debugger for x86-linux. Helped trace a few hard-to-catch bugs in
Freecell Solver.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim - Vi Improved</a> - an excellent
cross-platform text editor with many powerful features.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a> - an Open-Source source control
management system that is used in maintaining the Freecell Solver codebase.
While it has proved adequate for my needs so far, it has some limitations,
so you may wish to look at better alternatives.
</p>

<h2>Programs that use Freecell Solver</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.kde.org/kdegames/">kpat</a> - a Solitaire suite for
the <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> desktop for UNIXes.
Uses Freecell Solver to solve its Freecell boards, starting of the
version that was shipped with KDE 2.1.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.ambermango.com/f3d/">Freecell3D</a> - a 3-Dimensional
Direct-X Freecell Implementation for Windows. Shareware.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.rrhistorical.com/rrdata/Fcpro65/">Freecell Pro</a> - a
free Freecell implementation for Windows with many professional features.
Integrated Tom Holroyd's Patsolve, and the original Don Woods' solver
as well as my own.
</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p class="desc">
Links to the homepages of people who contributed in any way to Freecell
Solver. Because of spamming issues, I don't put their E-mails here. In case
you want their E-mail address, either go to their homepage or send me an E-mail.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.informatik.mu-luebeck.de/~kulow/">Stephan Kulow</a> -
as the maintainer of kpat for a brief period, he contributed bug fixes,
memory leaks reports, and general commentary to Freecell Solver. Stephan and
I still hold discussions about FCS in the mailing-list or in private.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/4929/">
Justin Heyes-Jones</a> - I learned about the A* scan through his webpage,
and he allowed me to incorporate his binary heap code into Freecell Solver.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/">

to Freecell Solver. He is the author of
<a href="http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/pysol/">PySol</a>,
