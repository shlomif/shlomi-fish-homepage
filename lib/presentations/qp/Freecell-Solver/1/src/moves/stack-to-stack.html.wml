<li>
To test the initial versions I generated a 1000 test boards.
</li>

<li>
I noticed some of them were not solvable.
</li>

<li>
I played some of them manually, and noticed they were solvable using
a move that I missed.
</li>

<li>
The latter was a meta-move that placed a card on a parent card on the
same stack
</li>

<li>
By implementing it, all of my boards turned out to be solvable.
