<br>
In the Technion, we hold a Linux instalattion party twice a year. The first one
in which I took an active part was that of Winter 97/98. One of the things I 
wanted to do in prepartion for it was to prepare a slogan, as well as a 
graphical banner representing it.<br>
<br>
One day my father, my sister and I were driving in our car, when I told him
that I seek such a slogan that will tell people how Linux is free and that a 
lot of the software for it is also free. Eventually my father suggested 
"Linux: Free software - Free aggregations.". I said that it had the right 
direction but lacked the final touch. After some thought, I came up with 
"Linux - Because software problems should not cost money".<br>
<br>
Thus, I set out to prepare the banner. First the "Linux" part. I used the 
Long Island font, which was present on our hard-disk at the time. It isn't 
bundled with Corel-Draw 4.0 so I don't know how we got it. Maybe out of 
Print Shop. In any case, that's not too critical as any heavyweight serif 
font will do.<br>
<br>
The "i" was singularily converted to the font "Bodoni Bd BT", which AFAIR is 
shipped with Corel-Draw. The reason for it was to resemble the "i" of Intel,
which is a common practice in drawing a Linux logo. A nice feature of 
Corel-Draw is that one can use the "manipulate" toolbar tool to change the 
properties or location of individual letters in a text.<br>
<br>
The finalized Linux was filled with a Corel-Draw texture. The texture is sky
3 colors with the colors of Light green as sky, light pale purple as 
atmosphere and white as clouds. The texture number is 4 and the softness 
is 50%.<br>
<br>
In order to fill the slogan, I first created a pattern. A pattern is a 
Corel-Draw image that can be used to fill another image. The pattern I 
prepared had a black background, with one horizontal strip filled with 
a horizontal blue gradient. At first I considered green, but my father
said it should be blue and I think he was right.<br>

<br>
After the pattern was created, I created the two lines of the slogan. Each 
line was a separate object, so the pattern would be aligned in the same place 
of the letters. The font is called "Denmark", and it too does not come with 
Corel-Draw 4.0. I did not Italicize it - the font comes slanted. I had to tweak
with the paramters of the pattern fill a little, so it will come out in just 
the right place. After it was properly applied to the upper line, I applied it
to the bottom line in the same way using the "Copy Attributes" function.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, I added the background, which is a plain fill coloured 
Olive Yellow-Green. By the way, my father thought that adding a background was
a bad idea, and that I should keep it white. But my sister and I didn't think 
so.<br>
<br>
I even prepared a T-shirt with the banner. The Ironic thing was that even 
though the banner is about Linux, it was prepared entirely in Windows 95'. Oh 
well, Corel-DRAW was not available for Linux at that point in time...<br>
