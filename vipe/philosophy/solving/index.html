        Our enemies are democracies. A <b>democracy</b> is a system of 
        government that slowly becomes a mixture of Fascizm and Socialism. The
        alternative we propose is a <b>Linux</b>. A Linux is a system of 
        organization that never deteriorates and preserves the happiness,
        well-being, individual rights, and freedom of everybody (and as 
        opposed to common belief does not depend on an Internet being present)
        .
        </p>
        <p>
        Our mission is to replace all democracies with Linuxes using:
        </p>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>No force.</li>
            <li>No threats</li>
            <li>No politics</li>
            <li>No secrets, lies or other forms of dishonesty</li>
            <li>No purity of intentions among practicioners</li>
            <li>No abusive misuse of non-sequitors, manipulation of emotions, 
            and other ways to gain false political power</li>
            <li>No telling people what they want to hear, but rather
            telling them why there were mislead</li>
            <li>No defaulting on the thinking process</li>
            <li>No chance of failure</li>
            
        </ol>
