<latemp_subject "<get-var cpan_dist /> - markup languages for writing Prose" />

<p>
<get-var cpan_dist /> provides <b>Fiction-Text</b> a lightweight 
plaintext-based 
markup language that can be used to write such fiction as stories, novellas
or possibly even novels. Fiction-Text is in turn converted to 
<b>Fiction-XML</b> which is an XML-based grammar (which can be used directly)
which is in turn translated to such formats as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML">XHTML</a> and
<a href="http://www.docbook.org/">DocBook/XML</a> for rendering by
web-browsers, and for conversions to different formats, including PDF.
</p>

<p>
<get-var cpan_dist /> is part of the <a href="../">Web-CPAN XML-Grammar
project</a> that provides several specialised processors for XML grammars
for various tasks.

<h3 id="news-2009-11-25">2009-11-25: <get-var cpan_dist /> version 0.0.2 was
released</h3>

<p>
<get-var cpan_dist /> was released today, and should be available on CPAN
mirrors. This release features several improvements to the code's 
internals and automated tests suites. The external behaviour of the code
should remain the same, but the code is now much more malleable for future
improvements, and there may have been a few accidental fixes.
</p>

<h3 id="news-2009-11-05">2009-11-05: <get-var cpan_dist /> version 0.0.1 was 
released</h3>

<p>
The first version of <get-var cpan_dist /> (v0.0.1) was unleashed onto the
world today. It was written for my own personal use as a writer of Hebrew
stories, but I naturally decided to release it as open-source software.
As first versions go, this version is rough on the edges, and has hairy
internals, and other warts, but still should be usable enough for people
who are clueful enough.
</p>

<p>
Happy <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo (National Novel
Writing Month)</a> and hopefully <get-var cpan_dist /> will prove of assistance
to you for this NaNoWriMo or future ones.
