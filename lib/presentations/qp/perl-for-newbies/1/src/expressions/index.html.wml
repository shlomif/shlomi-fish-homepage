<p>
Perl supports such mathematical operators as <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>,
<code>*</code> (multiplication), and parenthesis (<code>( ... )</code>). An example
is worth a thousand words:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/expressions/operators.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
The output of this program is:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/expressions/operators.out.txt" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
The operators have the same precedence as their mathematical equivalents. The
parenthesis are useful for making sure a sub-expression will be evaluated
before all others do.

<h3>Note:</h3>

You can use commas to print more than one expression at once. It beats
writing a separate <code>print</code> command for every expression you wish to
output. However, for better readability, it is recommended that you will
separate your expressions among several prints.
