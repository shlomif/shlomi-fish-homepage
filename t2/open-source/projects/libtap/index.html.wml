Test Anything Protocol</a> for C originally created by Nik Clayton. This is a
maintenance branch by me (= Shlomi Fish).

<p>
libtap-1.10.0 was released. It is identical to the previous release only with
an incremented version number to avoid problems with upgrading from 1.03.
</p>

<h3 id="news_2014_01_12">12-January-2014</h3>

<p>
libtap-1.2.1 was released. This release converts to a <a href="http://cmake.org/">CMake</a>-based build system instead of a GNU Autotools based one,
and also generates and installs a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkg-config">pkg-config</a> file
(<code>libtap.pc</code>).
</p>

<h3 id="news_2010_08_16">16-August-2010</h3>

<p>
libtap-1.03 was released. This release contains a NEWS file as well as some
fixes from the CCAN (= Comprehensive C Archive Network) version of libtap.
However, some of the changes in CCAN made the libtap API incompatible with
that of the original libtap-1.01 so they were rejected.
