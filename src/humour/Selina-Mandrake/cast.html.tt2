On this page, I would like to note who I think should be the cast for some
of the characters of Selina Mandrake.

<p>
I'd like Whedon to direct <i>Selina</i> because I feel it should be directed
the same as the first three seasons of <i>Buffy</i>, before <a
href="https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Faith_Lehane">Faith</a> was eliminated and
the <a href="https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Scooby_Gang">Scooby Gang</a>
graduated from high school, and Buffy likely became a soap
opera. Anyway, while Buffy had very good special effects, the ones in <i>Selina</i>
may be somewhat more cheesy.
</p>

<p>
I believe more directors can and should direct parodies and <a
href="https://github.com/shlomif/my-real-person-fan-fiction">other fan
fiction</a> of their own works or franchises.

<h3 id="selina">Selina Mandrake: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Watson">Emma Watson</a></h3>

<p>
I originally wrote this argument for choosing Ms. Watson there:
</p>

<blockquote cite="">

<p>
Well, Selina has to be an Englishwoman, right? Otherwise, I feel that
Selina is similar enough to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger">Hermione Granger</a>
to warrant Ms. Watson playing her. Furthermore,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keira_Knightley">Keira Knightley</a>
plays the kind of females, who make the room miss a beat when they
are seen, which isn't what I want for Selina, who should be the kind of girl
that people should not feel intimated by.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
I think it was not the complete story as Watson's life paralleled both my life
as well as <a href="#kate">Kate Hampshire's</a> (only she was often better equipped,
either by her environment or by her own judgement, to avoid repeating some
of my mistakes.)

<p>
The Guide should be an American, a geek, and someone we
<a href="http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2012/08/answering-a-faq-why-do-you-play-so-many-evil-characters-lately.html">love to hate</a>
(because he brings Selina so much trouble, and is the story’s main
antagonist). He also can be somewhat older. I think Mr. Wheaton will
be perfect for all this.

<h3 id="kate">Prof. Kate Hampshire / Lady Kate Canterson: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Anwar">Gabrielle Anwar</a></h3>

</header>

<p>
Anwar lights up the room on fire when she is seen, and she seems suitable
for playing and narrating the voice of Kate.
She also played Queen Anne in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers_%281993_film%29">The Three Musketeers (1993 film)</a>, which was a completely dishonest film, so
now I want her to go full circle and play the more real life version of
Milady de-Winter, Kate Hampshire-Canterson.

<p>
I think Stewart resembles
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Richelieu">Richelieu</a> enough
and I once imagined that Richelieu (= “The Commander” in the old Selinaverse
with the Bajoran gods/profiles) was eventually “reincarnated” and “reborn”
as Patrick Stewart in a more recent life, who ended up playing an even more
upgraded version of “The Commander”,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Picard">Captain
Jean-Luc Picard</a> (a.k.a: “The Picard”). Finally, Capt. Picard is a
Frenchman, just like Cardinal Richelieu.
