[% WRAPPER intro %]

<p>
Being a software developer, that is also very interested in computers and like
to program for fun, I started conveying some of my thoughts about computing
and this field’s social aspect in various essays I wrote. I hope to concentrate
all of them under this section of the homepage.
</p>

<p>
Some of these essays will require some technical knowledge, but most of them
can be read by anyone with a pseudo-technical background.
