One day, an E-mail was sent to a mailing list I am a member of,
referring to <a href="http://www.logicmazes.com/theseus.html">the
"Theseus and the Minotaur" maze</a>. (Originally at
Oriel Maxime's Homepage)

It took me two sessions in front of the computer, in each one
spending several hours there, in order to solve it.

Then I wondered: can a computer solve it as well?
