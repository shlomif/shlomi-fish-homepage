<s id="towtf1" title="Selena Mandrake, the Vampire Slayer">

[<b>Written by:</b> <a href="$(ROOT)/">Shlomi Fish</a>.]

[<b>Note:</b> This is a tribute/parody of "Buffy, the Vampire Slayer" (both
the movie and the show) and of other sources of inspiration such as 
the Star Trek frenchise (primarily "Deep Space Nine") as well as other sources.

[<b>Note:</b> style note, when the vampires and demons in the story talk in
a dramatic and phony tone it is placed in "ALL CAPS" (inspired by the talk
of Death in the Discworld series). When they talk non-dramatically and honestly,
it is placed in proper capitalisation.]

[Selena Mandrake is sitting in a classroom taking notes, the other students 
are paying attention, and taking notes too. Selena is an attractive (but
not overly so) blonde girl in her high school senior year, who has immigrated
to California from England.]

Selena's Internal Dialogue: [in her native English accent] wow! Why did I have
to major in history. All we learn about is minutae of obscure political
documents from modern times. Like that's going to prepare me for being an 
Archaelogist . Maybe I should have majored in maths… or physics… or something.

+++: not to mention that U.S. archaelogy is a joke. Not that England is much
better. Maybe I could study somewhere in the middle east. Turkey… Egypt… 
Israel… mmm…
