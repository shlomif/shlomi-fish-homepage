<latemp_subject "Solvers and Other Programs for Japanese Puzzle Games" />

<p>
Japanese puzzle games, either those published by the Japanese publisher Nikoli 
or similar, have become popular in recent years, and I've been enjoying solving
them on the computer (or sometimes on paper) as well. Like any good programmer,
I've been asking myself "How can I get a computer to do the hard work for me?"
and started working on some solvers for them. This section contains the
solvers that I started to work on, or mostly completed.
