The entire scalar or data structure pointed to by the reference can be
retrieved by dereferencing. Dereferencing is done by using a <code>$</code>,
a <code>@</code> or a <code>%</code> (depending if the reference refers to a scalar
, array or a hash respectively), and then the reference inside curly braces.

Here are some simple examples:

<p>
If the expression that yields the reference is a simple one than the curly
brackets can be omitted (e.g: <code>@$array_ref</code> or <code>$$ref</code>).
However, assuming you use curly brackets - the expression surrounded
inside them can be as complex as you would like.
