                There is no IGLU Cabal. Shlomi Fish has obtained a patent on
                certain key technologies essential for the existence of IGLU
                Cabals. He is available for license negotiations only on
                February 29th of odd-numbered years, between the hours
                14:15:09-18:28:18.
            </p>

            <p>
                People, who practice IGLU Cabalism without the appropriate
                patent licenses, risk teleportation into the interior of
                exploding supernovae.

                Writing this sentence followed by an explanation has been
                patented by Omer Zak in US patent No. 10943307*2^66452-1.
                Commenting on Omer's comment has been patented by Shlomi Fish
                in US patent No. e^(i*pi). The sentence itself is a trademark
                of Moshe Zadka.

                The existence of these patents is the only explanation one
                needs for this sentence.

                There is no IGLU Cabal! Its members spent a better time of
                their lives writing an RDBM server in a purely functional
                programming language. After having to deal with designing
                many FP-friendly algorithms, and dealing with ugly code
                that was made uglier due to FP, they found the task of
                maintaining the IGLU site too mundane and unchallenging.

            There is no IGLU Cabal. The former Cabalists have been swallowed by
            the black hole of MPPL (Most Powerful Programming Language) and
            find the mundane programming problems posed by Linux kernel and
            applications to be incredibly elementary, trivial and boring.

          There is no IGLU Cabal! Its members can be arranged in N! orders to
          form N! different Cabals. The algorithm to find which order
          formulates the correct IGLU Cabal is NP-Complete.

                There is no IGLU Cabal. The problem of founding an IGLU Cabal
                has been proven, in a surprise move, to be equivalent to the
                question of existence of God, fully-tolerant religions and
                NP-complete oracles.

                There is no IGLU Cabal! Home-made Cabals eventually superseded
                the power and influence of the original IGLU Cabal, which was
                considered a cutting edge development at its time.

            There is no IGLU Cabal! They had to write a web application in an
            API (which chose to remain nameless) in which one has to call
            CreateFile with 6 or 7 arguments just to open a file. By the time
            they were done, someone wrote a 30-line perl script that did
            exactly the same thing.</p>

Yes, the Thread-Local-Storage people were annoyed by this clash, and
decided to change their name. The new name they came up was "Storing

            This is besides the fact that the IGLU Cabal Does Not Exist, and

My Commodore 64 is suffering from slowness and insufficiency of memory;
and its display device is grievously short of pixels.  Can anyone help?

Leave your Commodore alone, this platform does not allow good scaling, even
doubling RAM amount... I think it's good time to upgrade to XT. You can even
install another 8088 instead of 8087 co-processor. Dual-CPU system would
allow greater throughput in multiuser environment. Yes, I know it demands
bigger initial investment, but the ROI is guaranteed in no more than 2
years.

            <p>Hello, mein kinder.</p>

            <p>While both Gilad and yours truly are indubitably and inalienably right, it
is often that clients in their infinite (the hands - they have a life of
their own and will not type "wisdom") perversity will ask for such
wonderful contraptions as RTAI kernel running in Red Hat 7.2 distribution
with Mozilla 1.5 backported into it, the whole thing shouldered a-la the
Tokyo Underground at 7am into a 16MB NAND flash running with a proprietary
driver (Gilad - we know the culprits, do we not?)…</p>

<p>
What should the indie, the consultant, the Gitche Manitou of the right
solution, do in such a case? Shove the right thing down the client's gullet
(I did that, it is very trying to shove a 48-node cluster down ANYONE's
gullet and, truth be told, not very hygienic)? Let the client blithfully
trundle towards his/her/its doom? Lie outright, say you do this, do the
other? What?</p>

          I installed Linux (first Red Hat, then Mandrake) for my mom a few years ago.
The reason: her TV card refused to work properly in Windows no matter what we
tried. So she was extremely happy with Linux and hardly bugged me at all. And
believe me, she's rather clueless on the computer (she does stuff like opening
a doc file in word and choosing "save as.." in order to rename a file :).
</p>

<p>
Anyway, she was using linux happily, w/ a dual boot to Windows which she
hardly used, and then my brother convinced her to let him install Windows
instead.
</p>

<p>
Now, she keeps calling everyone every week or two with problems in her Windows
and she really misses her Linux… (she misses the uptime, the multiple
desktops, the fact that things didn't suddenly break and stop working for no
reason, her games - Aisleriot, PySol, LBreakOut 2, and other things I can't
think of right now.)
</p>

<p>
Oh, and about the command line, back then when she tried to shut down her
linux, sometimes some process needed manual killing, so I gave her the set of
commands she needed to type in the command line and she had no problem doing
that. In fact, she preferred doing that than, say, dragging some file in
Windows, because for her it's easier to give the computer some commands she
doesn't really understand than to start trying to figure out "intuitive"
GUI…

            Well, no. Russians do not use everything for drinks. It has been
empirically proved that some substances - e.g. slag - cannot be
used to make drinks.
</p>

            <p>
Worse, some substances - e.g. slag - cannot be even used for the
after-drink zakuska.
</p>
            <p>
Yet even worse than that, some substances - e.g. slag - are not
even useful for bottling drinks.
</p>
            <p>
The silver lining on the rain cloud, however, is that there are precious
few such substances. Namely, one - slag.

<p>
    &gt; My personal advice and preferences:<br/>
    &gt; Don't bother with advice about understanding 50-line code blocks.<br/>
    &gt; Advise how to make 10,000,000 line code base easier to understand.<br/>
</p>

<p>
Your advice is similar to going to a guy explaining home-improvement on TV
and showing how to build a shelf (or whatever) well, and telling him: "don't
bother with advice about building a shelf - advise how to build a 150 story
sky-scraper!". True, if a someone is about to build a sky-scraper, they should
not bother with the details on how to make a shelf (they'll hire someone to
do that), but most people will never need to build a sky-scraper in their
lives, while building shelves is a useful skill.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, most hobbyist (or even most professional) programmers will benefit
more from advice on writing 10,000 line programs than from advice on how to
write 10,000,000 lines.

I have much more books than I can put on my night-stand. Books that are
on my night-stand are quickly accessible (when I'm in bed, that is), and
books on the shelf are not (I hate getting up from the cozy, warm, bed).
So, when I suddenly feel like reading a book that is not on the night-
stand, I have no choice but to go to sleep. In the morning, I wake up and
always find the book I wanted next to the bed! As it turns out, when I was
asleep, another process, known as "sleepwalk" got me the book I wanted.
Also, when my nightstand already has too many books on it, The sleepwalk
process moves one of the books - the one I'm least likely to want to read
next - back to the shelf.
</p>

<p>
Last month, four Europeans with weird names decided to mess around with my
book-reading system. One called Alan decided that in some cases I should
move *all* my books to the shelf, go to bed without any books the same
night, and instead fill the nightstand with crap. And if somehow all my
shelves are full I should just burn one at random (if it burns the whole
shelf, or the wrong shelf, who cares).<br/>
Another one, called Andrea, decided that I should redesign my whole
sleepwalking routine according to his master-plan. However, this made my
sleepwalking become so strange, that people were hesitant to call me
"stable" any more. Alan thought my new sleepwalking was a sure sign of
be not being stable.<br/>
But then a third European, Linus, finally made a judgment-call, and decided
that I was stable, even with Andrea's new sleepwalking routine. He then
told yet another European, Marcello, that from now he's responsible for
keeping me stable. I thought it was my shrink's responsibility, but
Marcello said no, that now that he finally has some responsibility he's not
going to just give it up.

2. Journaling filesystems:
</p>

<p>
Imagine writing stuff on a lot of different notes and pieces of papers,
etc., and then suddenly getting hit in the head and forgetting everything
(call this rebooting). You suddenly don't know which was the note you
were in the middle of writing, and you may end up finding a note saying
"kill &lt;name&gt;" not knowing you really meant to write "kill &lt;name&gt;'s jobs on
the department's workstation, because they are hogging all resources" before
you got hit on the head. That's why you should have a journal. Write
everything that you do in there, one entry after another, and only when
you complete a whole note, cut it out of the journal and keep it.
</p>

<p>
Also, when you go to the bathroom, don't forget to write down in the
journal about whether you're already done with #1, #2, or #3 (don't ask
what #3 is…). That way, if you suddenly get hit on the head (say, the
nice fake plant over the toilet falls on you) you won't get embarrassed,
asking yourself questions like "Oops, I don't remember if I did #2 or not,
so should I reach for some toilet paper or not?" If you had a journal,
everything would have been much simpler. Just look in there, and see what
you've been up to.

3. Blue Screen of Death:
</p>

<p>
Some people, after a bit of strenuous activity, or simply a couple of
days of normal life, suddenly go blue and freeze up. Some people call it
the blues, others just call it death, but in OS lingo it's simply the
Blue Screen of Death. When that happens to a you, somebody passing by then
needs to hit you on the head (this is called a "reboot", after the footwear
usually worn while kicking someone's head). After a minute, you wake up,
forgetting everything you didn't write down before the event, but
functioning much better than you did before (at least for the first hour).

                <p>4. User Friendliness and Graphical User Interface:</p>

<p>
Most people are not very user-friendly. Try talking to a person (especially
of the opposite sex) and trying to guess what you're supposed to do now,
what the other person wants from you, what would happen if you did this,
and what would happen if you did that, and how the heck to you get the
other person to do what you really want. No more of that! People should
get a graphical user interface. Why talk to the other person in that
complex command line language we call "Hebrew", when you can just look at
the menu, see the options "Leave me alone" and "Let's have sex" and just
chose the one you want! Better yet, why not have a toolbar, with nice little
icons?

            <p>5. Authentication:</p>

<p>
In the simple old days, to recognize someone you'd just look at his face
and try to remember who it is (if you didn't forget it in one of the Blue
Screen of Death episodes). But there's a much better way, which is more
mathematically-sound: RSA! Why try to remember a (many times ugly) face,
when instead you can remember a person's 1024 bit RSA key? (remembering
1024 ones and zeros is a lot of fun! try it!) Then, when you meet the
other person, and you want to be sure it is *really* that guy, not some
Hannibal Lektor who pealed his face off and wore it, all you need to do is
to make up a random number (try not to choose 7, because that is too easily
guessable!), do some fun arithmetic with 1024 digit numbers, and then tell
the other person the result (hoping that the other guy doesn't get bored
by you reading out aloud the digits "one" and "zero" a thousand times) and
ask him to try to guess the random number from it. If he succeeds, he's
not Hannibal Lektor - but he's probably mad anyway.

4. One of my friends works in a software development house who has an NT
server farm that needs to have close to 100% uptime and operationality.
Needless to say, they have top-of-the-class admins, and also make use of
scripting, the command line, command automation, etc. a lot. Most NT sys
admins don't know anything about the NT command line, much less about
scripting and automation.

<p>
Welcome to the real world with *real* MS sysadmins. Those who script,
automate, write code, know a thing or two about security and the
underlying technology. You know… professionals.
</p>
<p>
Please, please, do not tag those other "MCSE wannabes" with "Systems
Administrator" title. People that hardly know how to administer couple
servers and dozen workstations in my world are hardly called
"operators" (and the same stands in Linux world)
</p>

<p>
"operators". It's been a long time since I saw this word used anywhere. In
fact, I think the first and only time I saw it so far was in the story "The
Bastard Operator from Hell". (which is a highly recommended read).
</p>

<p>
    But we need a common word for both sys-admins and "operators".

                  There is no IGLU Cabal! They set out to write the "IGLU
                  Cabal Paradigm", which aimed to be the ultimate programming
                  paradigm ever created or ever to be created. Then they
                  became frustrated that some programming newbies who fully
                  read "The IGLU Cabal Paradigm Bible" still produced very bad
                  code.

                  There is no IGLU Cabal. The main organizer got 99% in the
                  course about starting and managing Linux Cabals, which he
                  took in the Industrial Engineering Faculty. However this
                  grade did not reflect his organizational abilities in the
                  real world, and this was the understatement of the century.

                  into Perl 5, back in 1996ish. It was since lost.).  I think

                      Yes, but I haven't finished yet. The contemporary names
                      for the Hebrew months are Pagan, for example
                      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iyar is:
                  </p>

                  <p>
                      «(Hebrew: אִייָר‎ or אִיָּר, Standard Iyyar Tiberian ʾIyyār ; from Akkadian
                      ayyaru,
                      meaning "Rosette; blossom"…The name is Babylonian in origin.»

                  <p>
                      (And Tamuz is the name of a Phoenician god who is akin to
                      the Egyptian Ossiris.)
                  </p>

                  <p>
                      As a result, we should use the old Biblical numerical
                      names of the months and call "Iyar" "The Eighth month" if
                      we start from Tishrey or "The Second Month" if we start
                      from Nissan and say that "Zayin in Iyar" is "Hayom
                      hashvi3i bahodesh hasheni" or "Hayom hashvi3i bahodesh
                      hashmini.". ;-) (I'm using the evil transliteration to
                      Latin out of laziness but I'm consistently inconsistent.)
                  </p>

                  <p>
                      And we should also revert to the old Phoenician /
                      Kna'anite alphabet which was originally used for writing
                      Hebrew instead of the contemporary Hebrew alphabet that
                      is derived from the Aramaic transformation of it… (There
                      are actually characters for it in Unicode).

                  But what did not succeed was to make the customers
                  <b>request</b> free [as-in-speech] and open source
                  software ( FOSS ) when they
                  (and not the creator of the operating system or the device)
                  choose a program themselves. For instance, only a small
                  part of the Android applications today are FOSS,
                  and the customers are “content” with a gratis and non-FOSS,
                  software program.
              </p>
              <p>
                  I think the reason for this is prosaic — the belief that
                  one can make money easily from non-FOSS software on Android.
                  That if you will only write an application and turn on the
                  bit of “show ads”, then suddenly you will make millions (or
                  at least thousands…) from advertising. What happens
                  eventually is that there are 17 “headlight” (for example)
                  applications in the app store, all showing ads, and each
                  one is used by 17 people and the developer earns a few
                  cents in the good case. This is instead of one headlight
                  application, as FOSS, which is better than all
                  of them (see http://code.google.com/p/search-light/ for
                  instance). But everyone except the users — Google and
                  the authors of the software — have an interest to push
                  the non-free program to the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                  In the early 1990s there was a similar phenomenon in the
                  PC world - the “shareware”. Then it involved a program
                  that you could get (without the source code!) free-of-charge,
                  but if you wanted to use it beyond a given time (for
                  example a week), or enable features that were limited in the
                  gratis version, you were supposed to pay for it. As far
                  as I know, the whole system was a complete failure — most
                  of the developers did not earn substantial amounts of
                  money, and most of the users ignored the limited features, or
                  cracked them. Nevertheless, during almost two decades,
                  thousands of programmers wasted their time to write such
                  non-FOSS software. Most of the gratis software for the PC
                  back then was shareware - not open source. Today, nothing
                  has remained from all this work. However, a large part of
                  the FOSS that has been written back then, is still
                  in use today.

                  If only there was a way to explain to the authors
                  of the mobile applications that no, most of them will not
                  get rich from the applications, like most of the authors
                  of shareware did not, and it’s just better to write FOSS…

              <p>

                  On the other hand, let's not forget what I believe to be the
                  reason for FORTH's demise. FORTH is a very elegant language,
                  with unorthodox ideas.  It was invented by Chuck Moore, who
                  is having his own eccentric (and fresh) ideas about how one
                  should program.  </p>

              <p>

                  The reason FORTH didn't take hold (at least in my own
                  projects) was that it lacked standard libraries for the
                  things which I needed. It expected people to reinvent the
                  wheel (and optimize it to their project's needs) all the
                  time. It didn't take to heart Pareto's Law (80% of the
                  computer time/programmer time/memory requirements/bug
                  expenses of software are in 20% of the code). People should
                  optimize and design their own implementations of data
                  structures only when and where they are critical to the
                  software's performance. For non-critical parts of the
                  software, standard libraries are good enough and should be
                  used.  </p>

              <p> The morale of the story to hash functions in STL: STL should
                  have provided a standard hash implementation (like Perl
                  does).  But the standard implementation should (like
                  implementations of all other STL data structures) have
                  provisions for people to substitute their optimized
                  algorithms when those algorithms are really needed for a
                  specific application </p>
