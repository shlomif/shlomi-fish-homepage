Several new additions were added to the site. The <a href="./art/">art
section</a> now contains two new pieces. I also added 
<a href="./open-source/bits.html#old_pmwiki_revert">a new script</a>
to the "Open Source Bits and Bobs section". Several new programs were
added to <a href="./open-source/favourite/">my favourite
free software</a>. Some new languages were added to
<a href="./humour/ways_to_do_it.html">the "Ways to do it" according
to the programming languages of the World</a> page.

<p class="newsitem">
Some of my newer projects are now mentioned in my resum√©s. I added
a link to <a href="./lecture/LAMP/slides/">a presentation about Web 
Publishing using LAMP</a>. Finally, 
<a href="./philosophy/obj-oss/">the Objectivism and Open Source</a>
essay was expanded with two new chapters.

Added <a href="./philosophy/computers/when-c-is-best/">the "When C is the

been eliminated, I have removed the notice box, and replaced my top-left

logo</a> based on <a href="http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20030803&amp;mode=classic">EvilPHish

The past few days have seen the move to a new hosting provider with much
better bandwidth to outside Israel. It should be much more faster and
responsive to most people. Other than that, the web-site has seen many
style and content changes:
</p>

<ol class="newsitem">
<li>
A computer music file that I created when I was in high school, with my
friend, was added to the <a href="./art/">art section</a>.
</li>
<li>
New section navigation menus were added to 
<a href="./philosophy/">the Essays
and Articles section</a>, <a href="./open-source/">the Software
section</a>, and <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/">the
Lectures section</a>. They will allow the main navigation menu to be
less crowded, and will give way for a faster update of the site.
</li>
<li>
Many typos were corrected in <a href="./DeCSS/">the DeCSS page</a>.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="./links.html">Links Page</a> was updated.
</li>
<li>
Several new essays and articles are now part of 
the <a href="./philosophy/">Philosophy
section</a>. Especially note 
<a href="./philosophy/computers/when-c-is-best/">the "When C is the
Best" essay</a> which started 
<a href="http://osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=12189">an active discussion 
in OSNews</a>.
</li>
<li>
I now have <a href="./philosophy/books-recommends/">a list of recommended
books</a>. 
</li>

There's still some more ground to cover on my part, but the homepage should
still be much better than it was 10 days ago.
