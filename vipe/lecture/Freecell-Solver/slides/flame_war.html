9 The fc-solve-discuss flame-war
</h1>
<h3 class="notbold">
<ul>
<li>
Recent versions of Freecell Solver pass the moves from the initial position
to the final solution to the layer above them.
</li>
<li>
The stack -&gt; stack moves are being outputted with the number of cards
that are moved.
</li>
<li>
Freecell Pro, on the other hand, used to ignore the number of cards and
expected such moves to comply with what the original Microsoft Freecell
would do in that case.
</li>
<li>
This caused problems in playback of a large percentage of the games in
its integration with Freecell Solver.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/197">A post</a> I made to the mailing list about it sparked a very big flamewar that diverted
to cover related topics.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/219">
I was actually happy</a> that there was some action there.
</li>
<li>
Usually the only things that happen there is that I announce new releases or
ask the members questions and no-one or few people reply.
</li>
<li>
Eventually, Adrian Ettlinger (an FC-Pro hacker) have extended Freecell Pro
to make use of an optional number of cards to move argument. This made
playback of Freecell Solver solutions perfectly smooth.
</li>
</ul>
