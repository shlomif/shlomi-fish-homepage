<!-- TITLE=Several New Essays, Update to “We, the Living Dead“, and More-->

Welcome to a new edition of the news feed of Shlomi Fish’s Homepage. In this

aphorisms, and a new “anti-bad-software” page. Read below for the details.

Furthermore, <b>actual code writing is not the most productive activity</b>,
as surprising as it sounds. That’s because if one writes code exclusively for too long, his mind will run in circles and he’ll lose his edge. And there’s something that is even more productive than actually producing output.

I talked with a few people on the IRC about it and some of them told me
something along the lines of “What makes you think that you know better than
all the universities and colleges (and other schools) that are now teaching
Java?”. Well, this is the “majority must be right” fallacy:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Everybody thinks that the Earth is flat (or the Sun revolves around it) so it
must be true

<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/web/homepage-vs-blog/">Homepage vs. Blog</a>: about the difference between a homepage and a blog,

<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#not_an_actor">More
    aphorisms</a> were added to the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html">Aphorisms Collection</a>:

<blockquote>
    <p>
    It does not mean what I think it means but it means what <b>you</b>
    think it means.

The work-in-progress <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">Star Trek: “We the Living Dead”</a> was updated with
new text and links:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    <b>Q</b>: in any case, there was this relatively mature man in our time
    called Noahh who had three sons.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Katie</b>: Shem, Hham and Yepheth? [in Modern Hebrew
    pronunciation]
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Q</b>: you guessed it. He was a quirky, paranoid fellow. At one paint
    he sensed a storm coming, and believed that the world was coming to an
    end. So he, his wife, his sons, and all of his livestock travelled up a
    nearby mountain, and waited for the storm to end.
    </p>

    <p>
    When the storm ended, he went down to the nearby village, and saw that
    while there was a lot of damage, it was perfectly fine. However,
    he claimed that it was high time to put an end to such problems, to end
    having to depend on natural whims, that our society will flourish.
    </p>

    <p>
    I was there: my name was indeed “Que” and I was considered a strange
    nomad, who just happened to be there. I decided to take upon myself
    the establishment of the [in Énglish] “civilisation” instead of the
    many different [in Énglish] “cultures”.
