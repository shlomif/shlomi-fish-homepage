[

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship">Ultimate Fighting Championship ( = "UFC")</a> is a mixed martial arts ("MMA")
competitions brand with very few officially disallowed moves.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronda_Rousey">Ronda Rousey</a>,
one of its contestants, is notable for having kept a fairly long streak of
consecutive wins.

This real-person-fiction ("RPF") screenplay presents a hypothesis of how she
achieved that.

<s id="main" title="Main Scene">

[

The year is 2011/2012 .
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Holm">Holly Holm</a>, the martial
artist who would defeat Ronda Rousey (during their second UFC match), is standing in a shopping mall. She had
invited Ronda for a day of hanging out together, with the ulterior motive
of getting her to fight <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Queen-Padme-Tales/Queen-Padme-Tales--Queen-Amidala-vs-the-Klingon-Warriors-indiv-nodes/About-Worf-and-Gowron.xhtml">in a fair way</a>.

Ronda approaches her.

Ronda: Holly, right?

Holly: That is right. Nice to meet you, Ronda.

Ronda: My pleasure [they shake hands.]

+++: Let's get straight to business: I presume you know I know why you invited me
for a day of "fun, socialising, and <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/hacking_and_amateur__vs__conformism_and_professional.xhtml">geeking out</a>".

Holly: To break your streak? If so, then yes!

Ronda: Well, it worked. You've won the psychological war. It's a shame really…
it would have been fun to keep it. You know how I am
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/learning_more_from_inet_forums.xhtml">an entertainer first</a>
and a martial arts' fighter later.

Holly: Heh… aren't we all?

Ronda: Yeah! [She thinks for a moment.]

+++: Hold it! But what if we fake a streak? It’s been a while since there was
one in pro-MMA and it’ll be a good publicity stunt for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship">UFC</a>.

Holly: Heh… I like your way of thinking, Ronda! Conspiracies are a time-honoured
tradition. [ References: <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/jewish_conspiracy.xhtml">Shlomif’s FAQ - “Are you aware of any Jewish world-domination conspiracy?”</a> ; <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/are_you_an_agent.xhtml">FAQ: "Are you an agent?"</a> ]

Ronda: Great! Wanna roll dice on who will be the streak-owner?

Holly: Nah… it was your idea, so it’s going to be you.

Ronda: really? Thanks! [She hugs Holly.]

Holly: [uses her smartphone] OK, the other UFC contestants approve of staging a streak
as a publicity stunt and will lose the fights to you on purpose.

Ronda: Sounds good!

Holly: heh, heh. Now that it is settled, let's have fun and geek out - as promised.

+++: You know, I was chatting on IRC the other day, when someone noted that he
read about a man who started with a paperclip and after some stages of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter">barter</a> ended up owning
a mansion.

Ronda: heh, hacks! I presume you won't agree to buying me a mansion, today?

Holly: Naturally not… but I can buy you a paperclip. A pack of 50 paperclips
is also within my budget.

Ronda: hah… I can try trading them for 50 mansions, and start a real-estate
agency!

[

Holly bursts out laughing; Ronda follows. They leave the frame.

Cut.

[

Part of my motivation for writing this screenplay was that some Internet
friends complained that some of my recent fics crossovered too many franchises
and/or were too fantastical.

So here you go - a <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/why_real_person_fiction.xhtml">real person fiction (“RPF”)</a> story with
a conspiracy hypothesis, but little if any supernatural
magic or technology.

Do note that this screenplay has been followed by "crazier" fics:

• <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/multiverse-cosmology/indiv-nodes/sample-game-session.xhtml">Sample session of “the game”</a>

• <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/The-10th-Muse/The-10th-Muse--Trojan-War-Reenactment.html">The 10th Muse: “Reenancting the Trojan War”</a> (work-in-progress)
