You can find the sources for this cartoon in
<a href="https://github.com/shlomif/d-and-d-cartoon-comparing-lances">a GitHub
<b>repository</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
I originally came up with the idea for it, while I was a high school, and drew
an initial version of it on paper, which was since misplaced. Later on, I
worked on preparing a version of it using the Inkscape vector graphics editor,
which you can see here.
