person fiction</a> starring
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Watson">Emma Watson</a> and
other real people, and did not actually take place. Whether it will actually
materialise remains to be seen.

The year is 2014. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Watson">Emma
Watson</a> - a British actress who rose to fame after playing Hermione Granger
in the Harry Potter films - graduated from Brown University with a degree
in English Literature and became a UN Women Good Will Ambassador. Shortly

Gurion Airport</a> in Israel.

<s id="at-the-passport-verification" title="At-the-Passport-Verification">

Airport clerk: Next, please. Name and passport?

Emma Watson: Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson; actress and model and UN Women
ambassador of good will.

Airport clerk: The passport looks legit. What are you planning to do in Israel?

Emma Watson: Touring and political activism. I’m not planning to be employed (and
if I do - I’ll let you know about it) but I am planning to visit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_envelope">the Gaza envelope</a>,
broadcast my exact location on the Internet, and try to bring
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalom">Shalom / Salaam</a> to the
region.

Airport clerk: Seems crazy.

Emma Watson: Well, I am sane enough to act crazy sometimes.

Airport clerk: Oh well, I doubt you’ll be in any remote danger anyway, and
since you are a British citizen, we cannot really prevent you from entering.

+++: Try not to get killed.

Emma Watson: Thank you! I will.

Showing Emma Watson’s Smartphone on Twitter she types there -
“Visit to Israel Begins. GPS coordinates in RT at emw.tld. Sderot,
here I come!”, and sends it.

[
She approaches a taxicab driver.
]

Emma Watson: Hello there.

Driver: Hello Ma’am. Do you want a ride?

Emma Watson: That I do! Note however that my phone will broadcast my exact
GPS coordinates every minute or so, so if you care about “privacy” (in quotes)
I’ll have to find someone else. On the bright side, I’m going to pay you
10 thousand sheqels regardless of how much the ride should cost, and also -
I’m Emma Watson, the famous actress, so— I can give you a signed photograph,
and a small souvenir, and naturally we’ll talk during the ride.

Driver: Works for me. Where do you wish to go?

Emma Watson: Sderot, please! But can we first stop at a gas station, where we can
eat and drink something?

Driver: Sure, Ms. Watson! Let me help you with your bags.

<s id="at-the-gas-station" title="At the Gas Station">

[ The taxicab stops. Emma Watson and the driver go out. ]

[ Cut to them sitting eating. ]

Emma Watson: Sorry if I’m too distracted and not too talkative, but I’m trying
to reply to as many of the social media responses I got for my recent
announcement of me going to visit the Gaza envelope. One thing I learned
from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bpVrKm9QCc">Shaike
Ophir’s English Teacher skit</a> is that one should avoid his definition
of monologue as “one person talking to himself”.

Driver: That’s OK, Ms. Watson - the customer’s always right.

Emma Watson: Yes. I received quite a few variations of “Bitch, are you
insane?” from fans, to which I made a top-level reply of “For all the people
who think I’m insane, be aware that if I complied by the mainstream definition
of sanity, I would not be half as successful as I am today.” (only in
Twitter-speak).

[ A waitress approaches Emma Watson ]

Waitress: I hope you’re having a good time, ah…

Emma Watson: Emma… Emma Watson!

Waitress: Oh! I heard about you, naturally. Are you gonna threaten me with
a wand? Heh!

Emma Watson: A wand… yes, the bane of my existence. I’m thinking of collecting
money for a public campaign to convert the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#evolution_of_girls_w_weapons">weapon
most associated with me</a> to something more menacing.

Waitress: Don’t you have enough money for that?

Emma Watson: No, not enough! Heh. And money isn’t everything.

Waitress: So you’re not playing in films for money?

Emma Watson: Playing in films for money? Of course not! What a preposterous idea.

Waitress: Ah, nice.

Emma Watson: I’m playing in films for <b>a shitload</b> of money!

[The Waitress and the Driver burst out laughing, Emma Watson joins them.]

Waitress: [Calming down] So, Ms. Watson, where are you going?

Emma Watson: I'm going to Sderot and the rest of the Gaza envelope. I’m trying
to bring Shalom / Salaam into the region.

Waitress: Sounds noble.

Emma Watson: Oh, it is.

Waitress: Well, let me know if you need anything, and I wonder if it will
be prudent…

Emma Watson: For you to take photos with me? Sure! Always happy.

Waitress: Thanks. My family are big fans of the Harry Potter books.

Emma Watson: I’m glad.

[The taxicab enters Sderot where there are some people waiting.]

[Emma Watson gets out of the cab, gives the cab driver the money, the photograph,
and a souvenir, takes a photo with him using her digital camera, shakes his
hand, says "Good bye" and part ways.]

Emma Watson: Hello good people of Sderot. Mah Nishm`a? [= Hebrew for
"What's new?"]

[Some laughs and cheers from the audience.]

Mayor of Sderot: Welcome Ms. Watson! I'm the mayor of Sderot. Hope you have
a peaceful and Shalom-ful stay. Here is my card if you need anything.

Emma Watson: Thank you, Mr. Mayor! I think I’ll have a glass of lemon juice
somewhere - you and other people can join me if they like.

Mayor: Sure, that will be lovely. I should note that the Hamas announced a
complete unilateral ceasefire today, but they didn't tell why and there’s
very little risk that the Israeli force will hit Sderot, but be careful
about these cars.

Emma Watson: Yes, I will. Finally, I’d like to buy some of those
“I {Heart} Sderot” T-shirts - small or medium sizes should be fine.

Mayor: Sure, we have some souvenir shops.

Emma Watson: Super.

<s id="at-the-restaurant" title="At the Restaurant">

[Emma Watson, the Mayor, and some other people are sitting at a restaurant.
Emma Watson is wearing a “I ♥ Sderot” shirt.]

Emma Watson: OK, I still need to handle the Internet fallout from my
announcement. I wonder if I should finally do a
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA">Reddit “I am Emma Watson, the famous
Actress and Model — ask me Anything!”</a>.

Man #1: What’s Reddit?

Emma Watson: Oh, it’s a system of Internet forums. Like a newer and better
Usenet. I’ve been under constant pressure to finally have a presence there.

+++: Problem is — I’m not sure anyone remembers Usenet nowadays. If I told
people my age that I am the new
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Joan_Hart">Melissa Joan Hart</a>,
they will just look at me funny.

Mayor: Sic Transit Gloria Mundi!

Emma Watson: Exactly!

+++: So? What do you for entertainment here?

Mayor: Well, aside from dodging Hamas missiles? [Emma Watson smiles] We watch
T.V., play sports, hang on the Internet.

Emma Watson: Sports! Is there a basketball game by any chance? I love playing
or watching basketball. Basketball is the kind of game that even if it’s a
bad game, it’s still pretty good.

Mayor: I would have thought that you would prefer Football as an Englishwoman.

Emma Watson: Well, I don’t. Anyway, if we can organise a basketball game, that
would be great. One warning: I’m gonna cheer for both teams.

<s id="basketball-game" title="The Basketball Game">

[ Emma Watson is watching the basketball game still wearing the “I ♥ Sderot”
shirt. ]

Emma Watson: Heh, it’s not such a bad game. [There’s a score. She cheers.]

Yuval: [= Boy next to Emma Watson] Yes, it’s a good game. So, Ms. Watson? Where
are you going to stay?

Emma Watson: Well, I can always rent a room at a hotel but… I’ve been thinking
of crashing into a host family and sleep on the sofa or in a spare bed room.
It’s not always the most comfortable thing but I’m always a sucker for an
adventure.

Yuval: Heh, we have a spare bedroom of my brother who is now in the IDF. I
guess I can try talking my parents into hosting you. Do you want me to message
them?

Emma Watson: Sure, first-come first-served I guess.

[Yuval uses his phone and types. A beep sounds.]

Yuval: Yay! We’re in. We can also give you supper and breakfast.

Emma Watson: Well, I’ll invite you all for supper on my expense in
your favourite restaurant here, but we’ll have a dinner at your expense.
And tomorrow I’ll go sight seeing around this area. The Sun here would
be very good for my tan, heh. [Another score in the game.] Yay!

+++: Your parents would be welcome to join me. You should probably go
to school, and I’ll do a school trip the day after tomorrow.
