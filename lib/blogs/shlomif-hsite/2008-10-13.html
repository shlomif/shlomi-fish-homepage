<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/MathVentures/two-angels-and-two-gates.html">A
    new riddle about two gates and two angels</a> was added to the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/MathVentures/">MathVentures</a> section:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There’s a famous riddle that goes like this:</p>

<p>
You are standing in front of two gates (a left one and a right one) - one leads
to paradise and the other leads to hell. You don’t know which gate leads where.
Besides the gates, there are two angels: one of them always tells the truth and
the other always lies, but you also don’t know which one is which.
</p>

<p>
You have one question to ask one of the angels, in order to find out which gate
you should follow. What would that question be?
</p>
