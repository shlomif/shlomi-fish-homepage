    <section id="introduction">
        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>
            I originally wrote <ulink url="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/software-management/end-of-it-slavery/">"The
                End of Info-Tech Slavery"</ulink> about a year ago, shortly
            after I was fired from a job I liked and for which I worked
            about three months. Some people who commented on the
            article found it of good value. However many people who commented
            on it have voiced some criticism.
        </para>
        <para>
            One of the comments I received said that I kept giving bad
            examples for conditions I disliked from previous workplaces,
            instead of positive elements I would have liked to see. Another
            commentor told me in private, that he felt that the
            "End of IT Slavery" and other essays of mine reflected the
            fact that I had a "primadona attitude" instead of a more
            positive "team-player" attitude.
        </para>

        <para>
            I can see why people would think so after reading the "End of IT
            Slavery". However, my intention in the article was to guide
            employers (and employees) as to how to best treat their employees,
            and give them good conditions, so they'll be happier and more
            productive. Going over the original article, I can see that I
            indeed had a very ranting tone, and gave bad examples for
            what not to do exclusively.
        </para>

        <para>
            So this time, I'm going to try again and hopefully be more
            successful. This article aims to cover the elements that
            <ulink url="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html">great
                programmers</ulink> would love to see in a perfect workplace.
            By implementing as many of them as possible, or at least giving
            them a serious thought, you can make such potential employees want
            to work for you, love to work for you, want to stay, and be
            happy as long as they are working for you. Furthermore, you will
            know better than to irrationaly fire perfectly good employees.
        </para>

        <para>
            I'm not trying to be original in this article, because an essayist
            (or any kind of artist) does not get credit for coming up with
            perfectly original concepts or ideas (as
            <link linkend="great-poets-steal">I note later</link> in a
            different context). What I'm trying to do is summarise everything
            I've learned, judged and concluded, so far, based on the many
            sources I've read. I may be just a dwarf standing on the shoulders
            of giant, but hopefully I'll still be able to see farther than
            most.
        </para>

        <para>
            There is a lot of material on good software
            management out there, and not everybody took the time to read
            all the important one. This material can sometimes
            be contradictory, and sometimes false. Nevertheless, I decided to
            integrate it here into what I've perceived and concluded to
            be the best choices.

                <ulink url="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">"Joel
                    on Software"</ulink> and others have written about
                the importance of having very good developers. See for
                example his
                <ulink url="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html">"Guerilla

                Bad programmers will create code that's buggy, insecure,
                hard-to-maintain, etc. The so-called "Medium-level techs"
                will probably not, but will be heavily under-productive in
                comparison to star programmers. (And according to
                <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks'_law">Brooks'
                    Law</ulink>, you can't effectively replace one good
                programer with many worse ones.)
            </para>
            <para>
                As I noted <ulink url="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.197867.7">there
                    are many aspects that qualify someone as a
                    good programmer</ulink>. However, it does not change
                the fact that hiring a large number of mediocre programmers
                will never be as effective as hiring one or two good
                or very good programmers.
            </para>
        </section>
        <section id="openness">
            <title>Openness</title>
            <para>
                One of the most important trends in the software world
                recently was towards "openness": open-source, open-content,
                open-specifications, etc. Most good programmers you can find
                will find the open source (also known as "Free Software")
                movement very appealing, and share some of its ideals. I
                don't propose you should make your software open-source,
                although, of course, this is often a good business model.
                However, there are other aspects of openness that you should
                follow if you want to attract and keep good programmers.
            </para>

            <para>
                First of all, don't over protect your code. Make it
                open-source if possible, give your contractors and consultants
                (including outsource ones) access to it, and allow your
                programmers to show parts of it to their online friends to get
                some advice. You should make as much of it as possible public,
                under
                <ulink
                    url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_license">open
                    source licences</ulink> to allow it to be used more often,
                increase its quality, and grow a culture around it. From my
                experience, working on "shrinkwrap" software that is used by
                end-users in the wild, and open-source software in particular,
                is the best way to increase the <ulink
                    url="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/high-quality-software/">quality
                    of the software</ulink> as it requires the most discipline
                to work on and support.
            </para>

            <para>
                Openness does not end at that. Another important aspect is
                to allow your programmers to tell their friends and family
                about what they do. Some defense-related companies seem to
                think keeping everything confidential is a good idea, but
                that will cause your employees to feel unnecessarily
                trapped and unable to get help. So if you want to attract
                the best programmers, make sure they can tell other people
                of what they do, and what problems they are facing. (I'm
                not advocating complete transparency, if it's not appropriate,
                but rather not being overly secretive. )
            </para>
            <para>
                Finallly, you should avoid vendor lock-in: use standard
                or documented protocols and specifications,
                <ulink url="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000052.html">take
                    Joel Spolsky's advice
                    of letting your users go back</ulink>, and make sure
                your users have control of their data and can access it,
                back it up and access it.
            </para>
            <para>
                A good example for this is
                <ulink url="http://flickr.com/">the photo-sharing
                    site Flickr</ulink>, which has
                published full APIs for its service, and even allowed these
                APIs to be used by competing site.

                    I don't necessarily agree that your workers should have
                    spacious offices with doors that close, but they should
                    still be comfortable enough. At one of my workplace, I
                    constantly had to move to let other people out of their
                    seats, and this was unbearable. So don't do that.
                </para>

                <para>
                    In one job that I fondly remember, every employee had
                    their own spacious cube, with a desk to put a computer and
                    a place to put a few chairs. This was much more like it.

                    on Steve McConnell) in item No. 9 of the Joel

                    If you buy old, broken and/or barely functioning hardware,
                    you'll spend a lot of time debugging the problems there,
                    which will waste a lot of precious time. And you may

                <para>
                    I've been to two workplaces that gave me an old
                    computer with a 40 GB hard-disk. It wasn't enough at
                    all. At one place, we've reached the limit of this
                    hard-disk due to several large source code checkouts,
                    and as a result needed a bigger hard-disk. And the
                    only hard-disks the lab had were 80 GB ones, which were
                    bought because they were the cheapest (per-disk, not
                    per-capacity). Please, <emphasis role="bold">buy

                    At the same workplace, I was given a computer with a

                    I brought a DVD of audio files from home, and could not
                    read it. In this day and age, read/write DVD drives

                    Competitive Salary? Yes, it's important, but not
                    absolutely everything. Great programmers won't work
                    for you for free, but they'll find many other

                        wrote about it

                    many studies:

                    <para>
                        Psychologist Theresa Amabile of Brandeis
                        University, cautiously summarizing the results of a
                        1984 study of motivation and reward, observed ``It
                        may be that commissioned work will, in general, be
                        less creative than work that is done out of pure
                        interest.''. Amabile goes on to observe that ``The
                        more complex the activity, the more it's hurt by
                        extrinsic reward.'' Interestingly, the studies
                        suggest that flat salaries don't demotivate, but
                        piecework rates and bonuses do.

                    <para>
                        Thus, it may be economically smart to give
                        performance bonuses to people who flip burgers or
                        dug ditches, but it's probably smarter to decouple
                        salary from performance in a programming shop and
                        let people choose their own projects (both trends
                        that the open-source world takes to their logical
                        conclusions).  Indeed, these results suggest that
                        the only time it is a good idea to reward
                        performance in programming is when the programmer
                        is so motivated that he or she would have worked
                        without the reward!

            <para>
                When doing
                <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">Pair
                    programming</ulink>, there are two programmers
                sitting next to a single computer screen and keyboard, with
                one of them actually writing the code, and the other one
                observing and helping. At first glance, it seems like it's
                a waste of resources: won't they be under-productive? The
                answer is a "no".
            </para>
            <para>
                First of all, pair programming increases run-time code
                review, as the "passive" programmer observes what the
                active programmer writes, gives him advice and answers
                his question. Code-review is always a good thing.
                <footnote id="pair-programming-and-code-review"

                    <para>
                        Pair programming is still not a substitute for
                        code reviews by people who didn't directly
                        write the code. It was noted at a blog entry
                        I recall reading somewhere but can no longer find.
                        <emphasis role="bold">TODO: Write more.</emphasis>

            </para>
            <para>
                Secondly, pair programming causes both programmers to have
                more discipline, and they are less likely to procrastinate
                as the active programmer will bore the watching one.
            </para>
            <para>
                Pair programming is also more fun, because people feel more
                comfortable working in pairs than alone.
            </para>
            <para>
                Finally, pair programming is more productive, because it was
                shown that it yields more output than two individual
                programmers.
            </para>
            <para>
                I had had a very good experience working in pairs back when

                If your employee is responsible, he'll care about his job

                These tasks and others don't interfere with the work much,

                <link linkend="pair-programming">pair programming</link>, you can be more certain your programmers
                will work. Don't judge your employees by how they spend their

                    on Software notes about experience</ulink>, the reason
                companies want people with a lot of experience in a certain
                niche, is because they tend to overcome problems they
                encounter more easily and so can help themselves and their

                        For example, I have a lot of experience working on Linux
                    and developing for it, with Perl and doing mostly
                    Algorithms and Text Processing in C. Recently, however I
                    got a job as a developer for a Linux Server-side C/C++
                    application. (dealing with sockets, processes, threads,
                    Unicode and other such advanced problems). While I made a
                    lot of progress, I noticed that I often got stuck on many
                    problems, for which I had no idea how to easily resolve. In
                    this case, my co-worker who had more experience than
                    me in this area, could often help me more.

                then bright people without a lot of experience can still
                prove to be useful and very productive. So don't demand too
                much from them. As of 2008, there aren't enough clueful
                developers in Israel for all the workplaces (and I think
                that's also the case in most other places), and you can't
                afford to be too picky.

                While it's easy to dismiss other people as "idiots"

                even incorrect conclusions or reasoning can bring useful
                insights, and give some food for thought. Sometimes, I find
                some useful insights in rehearsed things or short blog

                    use and interact with the program. It is not a technical
                    spec which explains how the inner software will work.

                    From my experience, functional specs are fun to write,

                <title>Software Engineering Methods to Avoid</title>
                <para>
                    There are few software engineering methods that I find
                    pointless, so I'd like to briefly point them out.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The first is the
                    <emphasis role="bold">"Huge-design-up-front"</emphasis>,
                    where an "architect" or even the entire team spends
                    a very long time writing an extremely comprehensive
                    and detailed technical document that specifies
                    in detail how the software will work.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The problem with this approach is that it is a huge
                    waste of time and also it is impossible to design
                    a large project top-down like that. A better way is to
                    involve the entire team in a good design session (a week
                    long at first) while writing some functional specs,
                    diagrams and some other documents, and then to write
                    it incrementally.
                </para>
                <para>
                    A similar fallacy is the <emphasis role="bold">"Mountains
                        of documentation fallacy"</emphasis> of having superflous
                    commenting, Literate programming, etc. The problem with
                    this approach is that the extra documentation is often
                    redundant if the code is well written and factored out
                    <footnote id="extract-method" label="Extract Method">
                        <para>
                            A good example is that instead of having the
                            following pseudo-code:
                        </para>

                            <![CDATA[
function create_employee(params)
{
    my emp = emp.new();

    emp.set_birth_year(params[year]);

    emp.set_experience_years(param[exp_amount]);

    emp.set_education(params[education]);

    ### Calculate the salary:
    emp.set_salary(emp.calc_education_factor(emp.get_education()) * emp.set_experience_years());

    ### More stuff snipped.

    return emp;

                        <para>
                        Then it would be a good idea to extract the
                        complex <literal>emp.set_salary()</literal> call to
                        a simple <literal>emp.calculate_salary()</literal>

                        the code self-documenting (as the method will have
                        a meaningful name) and much more robust for future
                        changes than adding a comment.

                        <para>
                        And this is just a small example.

                Some documentation (especially API documentation such as

                is good, and you shouldn't feel too guilty about writing a
                comment for an interesting trick, but too much documentation
                slows things down, and doesn't help with the design process,
                and eventually may turn out to be misleading or harmful.

                    or YAGNI ("You Ain't Gonna Need It")</ulink>. The basic
                    idea is not to implement too many features at once, or
                    over-complicate the design of the code, and instead focus
                    on getting the necessary functionality working.

                <para>
                    YAGNI, put aside, I still believe that some

                    The code-with-accompanied-documentation is somewhat
                    a sub-case of a more general fallacy: the belief that
                    a company can simultaneously maintain two different
                    codebases (say two codebases implementing the
                    same functionality in two different languages), while
                    keeping them both synchronised.

                    The Extreme Programming experts have been warning against
                    it, and it also makes sense that it is hard to do given
                    that programmers, by nature, lack the appropriate
                    discipline to keep maintaining two or more codebases at
                    once.

                    <ulink url="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FogBugzIII.html">has been
                        illustrated by Fog Creek software</ulink>. What
                    they did was implement a compiler from a common language,
                    to several target languages. Naturally, this compiler also
                    needs to be maintained and extended, but it is less work
                    and less error-prone than maintaining several different
                    codebases.

                Many workplaces seem to think that it is a good idea
                to make sure every developer is limited to a certain aspect
                of the development process, and will specialise exclusively
                in it. Taken to extreme, however, such a trend is very
                dangerous.

                Programmers need to have a solid understanding of the entire
                product stack in their head. Good programmers can also
                benefit from a change of scenery. And naturally, <ulink
                    url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review">reviewing
                    someone else's code</ulink>, and criticising it, is also

                Therefore, you should make sure that your workers don't
                over-specialise. Let them dedicate some time to work on
                what they find interesting, and let them review and
                criticise other people's work.

                Once, before I started my undergraduate studies, I worked
                for a developer of a software-based modem (so-called
                "Winmodems"). I was impressed from the atmosphere there,
                and how professional and clueful the managers were. One of
                the things I liked about the job was that while I was
                initially hired as a tester, I eventually was appreciated
                for my eclectic knowledge of different aspects of
                sound, games, modems, Internet, and other fields. So, I was
                given more diverse things to do there, involving many
                aspects of our operation.
            </para>
            <para>
                You should follow suit and involve your star developers in

                Joel on Software gives <ulink url="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html">a lot of good advice on having
                    a good customer service</ulink>. You should listen to
                what your customers (or users) say. Don't dismiss them.
                Don't give them annoying canned responses. Open your
                bug-tracker to the world as a web-service. There are many
                web-based, and gratis bug-trackers, such as
                <ulink url="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</ulink>,
                and you should use one of them for better interaction with
                your customers.
            </para>
            <para>
                As Joel indicates, a bug report, email, or query usually
                indicates a problem in the software: a bug, a missing feature,
                or something that's not clear enough. Such problems need to
                be fixed in the code.
            </para>
            <para>
                Furthermore, if one or more of your customers are requesting a
                feature, and it seems to be important enough, give a priority
                to implementing it. As a Mercury Interactive (Now part of HP)
                developer

                usually the features requested by the customers, are the
                ones that will yield the most newer customers,
                not-to-mention will allow keeping customers, if they are
                paying for upgrades or as a "software-as-a-service" model.

                Originality and "innovation" is not as important as people
                think it is. It is perfectly OK to create a product in

                    niche which has a lot of existing competition</ulink>,
                it's OK to build on other people's efforts, and it's OK to
                "borrow" or "steal" (see the quote at the top) ideas from
                your users, competitors and friends.
            </para>
            <para>
                You're not getting credit for originality - you're getting
                credit for high-quality products (software, services, support,
                etc. - whatever you do) and especially for revenue and
                profits. See <ulink url="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000074.html">"Converting Capital into Software That Works" for

            <para>
                Another common fallacy is that ideas are the hardest part of
                the production process. However, ideas are very cheap, and
                creative people have far too many good ideas. It's actually
                harder to develop the idea into a product, to mass-produce it,
                and then to mass-distribute it. Edison was not the first to
                come up with the Electrical Lightbulb, or to develop a working
                prototype, but he was the one to have put up all the effort in
                making it so popular and prevalent. Therefore, he is rightly
                credited as its inventor.
            </para>

            <para>
                Similar in software, you can often see competing products
                displacing more established competition, or sometimes
                a market where there isn't a clear winner (e.g:
                <ulink url="http://xwinman.org/">window
                    managers and desktop environments for Unix</ulink>,
                Bug trackers, text editors, etc.)

                        This illustrates that as technology progresses, people

            <blockquote>
                <para>
                    One anti-pattern I noted in a previous workplace was what I
                    called "Knowledge in the Ether": most of the instructions
                    for getting the application up and running, and a lot of
                    the collective knowledge were not written down in a
                    collective place. TDDPirate said he was familiar with it
                    and called it the <ulink

                </para>
                <para>
                    The solution for this is simple: set up a wiki for the
                    company, and instruct people to write a note there whenever
                    they need to explain to someone how to do it (or give a
                    link to a previous note), <emphasis role="bold">instead
                        of</emphasis> guiding him how to do
                    it. While this requires some discipline and getting used
                    to, it can also be done after the fact.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Obviously the amount of knowledge in people's head and in
                    the Ether can never be completely eliminated. But it should
                    be kept down to a minimum.

            <para>
                There was also a comment that said one should write a script
                to do that. And it's a good idea to keep good README files,
                comments, etc. and to use a standard building procedure,
                or prepare distribution-level packages for the software.

            <para>
                Nevertheless, a workplace enoucrage its employees to note
                down every useful knowledge and procedure. My friend once
                told me that in his previous workplace they kept a
                knowledge-base as a group of Microsoft Word documents stored
                inside Visual SourceSafe. As a result, people felt it was
                too much bother to update and maintain them. Eventually,
                he set up an instance of <ulink

                    I once been to a job interview in downtown Tel-Aviv,
                    which went very well. Then I received a phone call from
                    them that they want me to come and install Fedora Linux
                    on the computer. I did that, and next thing I knew, I was
                    given other tasks.
                </para>
                <para>
                    I was instructed to write a mail-processing framework
                    in PHP. Now since I know and love Perl, I know there
                    are many fine modules for doing that on <ulink url="http://sial.org/howto/perl/life-with-cpan/">CPAN (= The
                        Comprensive Perl Archive Network)</ulink>, but there
                    was little of substantial quality for PHP. At a certain
                    time I needed to register at a site, to download the
                    latest version of a PHP library, that was free software,
                    because the download required authentication. There didn't
                    seem to be anything better.
                </para>
                <para>
                    I was told that they would prefer to write everything
                    in PHP, because they expected to hire only PHP programmers,
                    possibly without any Perl experience.
                </para>
                <para>
                    That wasn't all. They also decided against using <ulink
                        url="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</ulink>,
                    which is a modern, high-performance and open-source
                    SMTP server, and instead preferred the old
                    Sendmail SMTP server which has a far worse reputation,
                    and an arcane configuration system.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Furthermore, they also decided to use MySQL instead of
                    PostgreSQL, and we ran into a PHP misbehaviour (which
                    was fixable given a lot of PHP know-how) that made us have
                    to restart the connection to the server after every
                    request. Both MySQL and Sendmail were chosen from
                    political reasons.
                </para>
                <para>
                    With my PHP code barely working and prune to many errors,
                    I decided to quit after about a month, out of being
                    appaled by the bad code craftmanship I could do there.
                    Make sure you don't repeat such a mistake.

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <para>
            Not all the possible advice for how to manage a workplace was
            covered here. I refer you to the links at the beginning and
            inside the document for more reading. You should read them and
            be enlightened.
        </para>
        <para>
            The workplace I'm talking about is a workplace that aims to
            employ great programmers to work on great projects, which
            your developers will love to do. It's not meant for a sweat-shop
            or one of those companies working on all these low-quality
            applications for internal-use, especially those that are
            developed by or for large organisations.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you want to hire the top developers, you should aim for
            a top environment and very good conditions.
        </para>
        <para>
            I don't intend this document to be dogma, but rather to provoke
            clear thinking of the matter. A lot of bright programmers I've
            talked with about the vision of a perfect workplace, have claimed
            that this is an non-achievable fantasy, and that all
            employers are much more clueless than that. However, while
            perfection can never be achieved, I've seen my share of good
            workplaces, and benevolent and clueful employers, and I think many
            of them are enlightened enough to improve according to my
            suggestions.
        </para>
        <para>
            It's not necessary for a programmer to be a wage slave - they need
            to be treated much better than that, if their employer
            wants them to be productive and happy. I hope this essay
            explained how.
