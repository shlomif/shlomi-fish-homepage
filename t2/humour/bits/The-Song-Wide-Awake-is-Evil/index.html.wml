<h2 id="context">Context for the Bit</h2>

<p>
I was chatting in an online chatroom the other day, when someone I talked
with told us: "I am only half-awake.". So I said:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
That’s not good. You should be wide-awake instead - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0BWlvnBmIE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0BWlvnBmIE</a> .
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(The link is to the music video of the song “Wide Awake” by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry">Katy Perry</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Shortly after that, I was quieted from the channel temporarily (for 24 hours)
with the explanation that I should not link to web resources containing
“naked or half-naked women”.
</p>

<p>
This got me thinking: while there is a short sequence at the beginning
where Ms. Perry is
shown naked in the video, without showing any sensitive parts, and without
the video being marked as pornographic/non-safe-for-work, is it really
that inappropriate? Like one of my friends later commented about it: “it’s
the kind of video that 8 year olds watch twice a day.”. Furthermore, other
participants of the chatroom shared similar possibly-iffy videos in the past,
I didn’t remember at the time that it depicted that, and that it was given
only as (quite lame I admit) joke in the context of the conversation.
</p>

<p>
This eventually led to me writing this bit. Note that it is written
tongue-in-cheek, and I'm actually quite fond of the song.
</p>

<h2 id="text">The Feature Itself</h2>


<p>
The song “Wide Awake” by Katy Perry is Evil!!!
</p>

<p>
It is immoral, unethical, antithetical, impractical, illegal in many
countries, incomprehensible, undesirable, encourages bad behaviour in children
and adolescents, and completely illogical and unlikable.
</p>

<p>
It contains nudity, half-nudity, ¾ of nudity, and any α-nudity where
0≤α≤1.3!
</p>

<p>
Linking to it, while in a chat-room, as a lame joke to someone who said
they are only “half-awake” will get you banned!
</p>

<p>
Seriously, this song will eat your dog! It will also eat your cat, your
dog’s kittens and your cat’s puppies!! (Or maybe vice-versa…) It will kill
your children, rape your wife, insult your grandparents, as well as cause
global warming!
</p>

<p>
It will redo everything that Chuck Norris has undone for humanity! (Or
maybe vice-versa…)

<p>
Are you ready for that much <b>EVIL</b>? You're probably not, but since the song
has corrupted me, I’ll give you a link:

<p>
You have been warned.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
This bit was published on 1 April 2016 as an alternative April Fool’s Day
joke. I originally wrote it some time before it and decided to publish it
because my other ideas didn't seem as good.
