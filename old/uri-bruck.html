Hi,
Just from a cursory looks a few sentences that jumped to my eye as "too
English":

"לינוקס הינה חתרנית"   - הינה looks like a redundant raising of register,
and I'd add מערכת הפעלה.

"מספר אלפים של מפתחים המפוזרים "   - מספר אלפי מפתחים

"עד לזמן שלינוקס נכנסה למסך הראדאר שלי " - 'עד לזמן' sounds very English.
Simply 'עד שלינוקס...' would be much better. That radar screen metaphore
doesn't work in Hebrew nearly as well as it does in English.
Now that I look at the English it seems that 'עד ש..' is not what the
original says.
"By the time .., I had already been involved.." means that when he learned
of linux, he had already been involved with unix and open source.
I'd suggest rewriting the sentence like this (this is perfectly acceptable
in translation):
"בתחילת 1993, כשלינוקס חדרה למודעות שלי, היה לי כבר ניסון של 10 שנים של
מעורבות בפיתוח של תוכנות יוניקס וקוד-פתוח."

"העבודה דרשה את זה!"  - 'it' should rarely be translated as 'זה'
here I'd write "העבודה דרשה זאת"

how many words is the entire text?
