    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
        When <ulink url="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky 
            ("Joel on Software")</ulink> wrote his notorious blog post
        <ulink url="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01.html">"Language
            Wars"</ulink>, many people asked whether he has "jumped the
        shark" and that his blog will go downhill from there. I too have read
        the post, and agreed, that while it had a few good points, it was
        too based on "feeling rather than knowing". Joel later on posted
        many good articles and shorter entries on his blog, but many people
        still recallled it as a very low-point in the blog.
    </para>

    <para>
        Like Joel, I have a home-site and several blogs, where I post articles
        and essays about my thoughts, and this time I've decided to risk
        something similar to what Joel has done on an equally flamatory topic:
        <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_licence">licences
            of open-source software</ulink>. I'm going to introduce the various
        options, explain a little about their history and motivation and then
        give some advice according to my own personal opinion.
    </para>

    <para>
        I should note that I am not a lawyer, and only write this according
        to my best knowledge, understanding and experience.
        <footnote id="ianal" title="IANAL">
            <para>
                Some people believe that discussing legal matters should be
                reserved to people who are Law experts. However, this is
                a <ulink url="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=39148&amp;cid=62149">sub-case 
                    of the "only specialists should deal with a
                specialised field" fallacy</ulink>.
            </para>
            <para>
                Like it or not, the Law affects us all and the Government
                expects common citizens to be aware of it and not violate
                it, even if they are not lawyers. As software developers, we
                do not limit discussions on software and computing to people
                with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (much less a
                Ph.D. or whatever) and often not-too-qualified people can be
                very knowledgable and/or productive.
            </para>
            <para>
                Similarly, I expect discussions on the governmental law to
                have a lower barrier for entry than people who are qualified 
                lawyers, or Law Professors.
            </para>
        </footnote>
        I think what I'm writing here is correct, but would still appreciate
        any correction for future versions. If you're unsure about my advice,
        then my advice to you is to consult a legal expert (if you
        can afford one) or your local or global Free and Open Source Software
        organisation. I cannot guarantee my advice is valid.
    </para>
    <section id="spoiler">
        <title>Spoiler</title>

        <para>
            In this spoiler I'll explain what I'm using right away, which is
            also what I recommend other people to use. When I started
            releasing my code as open-source software, I used <ulink 
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">the 
                Public Domain</ulink>. So, for example,
            <ulink url="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</ulink>
            which is one of my earliest projects and still one
            of the most successful, still carries <ulink url="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/fc-solve/trunk/fc-solve/source/COPYING?rev=705&amp;view=log">a 
                <filename>COPYING</filename> file</ulink> with the 
                following contents:
        </para>
        <blockquote>
            <para>
                Relax, this is not GPL software, but rather it is distributed
                under the public domain. It means it can be linked against
                anything, converted to any different license, freely used and
                distributed, and anything else without any restrictions 
                whatsoever. No Strings Attached!â„¢
            </para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>
            (This was also a joke of sorts.)
        </para>

        <para>
            Later on, to avoid the problematic status of public domain code
            in many countries, and to avoid other potential legal problems,
            I started distributing my original code under <ulink 
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_license">the 
                MIT X11 Licence</ulink>, a BSD-style licence which is the 
            closest one to the Public Domain. If the project I'm
            contributing to has a different licence, then I disclaim any
            explicit or implicit ownership on the code I wrote, and allow
            the existing copyright holders to do with my code as they see
            fit.
        </para>

        <para>
            Note that I'm using different terms for other types of
            digital artworks. Most of my essays (including this one) are
            under the <ulink url="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative 
                Commons Attribution Licence</ulink>, my original (i.e: 
            non-derived-work or fan-art) fictitious stories are under 
            <ulink url="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">the 
                Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike Licence</ulink>
            (which is more GPL-like), and most of the
            photos I took and published were placed under the Public Domain.

        <title>What is a Free Software Licence?</title>

        <para>
            According to the <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software Definition </ulink> free software must fulfill 4 freedoms:
        </para>

        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>

                <para>
                    The freedom to run the program, for any purpose
                </para>

            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs.
                    Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
                </para>

            </listitem>
            <listitem>

                <para>
                    The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour
                </para>

            </listitem>
            <listitem>

                <para>
                    The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the
                    public, so that the whole community benefits . Access to the source code is
                    a precondition for this. 
                </para>

        </listitem></orderedlist>

        <para>
            The <ulink url="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.php">Open Source definition</ulink> is similar, but some licences can qualify as 
            open-source and not as free
            software. This is usually not an issue, because the majority of open source
            software out there is free as well. (And few people would like
            to create an open-source licence that's not endorsed by the
            Free Software foundation.)
        </para>

        <para>
            A software licence qualifies as a free software/open-source 
            licence, if it allows those four freedoms. There's still a lot of 
            room to manuever and to impose various restrictions, but otherwise
            these freedoms make them usable enough for the users and
            co-developers.
