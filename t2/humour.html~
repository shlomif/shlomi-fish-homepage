<H3><I>A Jewish Deduction</I></H3>
The Bible dictates that "Thou shalt not seethe [=cook] a kid [= young goat] 
in his mother's milk." To avoid any possibility of breaking that regulation, 
the Jewish tradition ruled that it also applies to female goats, 
to mature goats, and to the meat and milk of two completely unrelated 
goats. It is also forbidden to eat the meat with fresh milk, and it 
applies to beef and mutten as well (including mixing the milk and meat 
of two different beasts). Finally, chicken, which are incapable of 
milk production, may not be eaten along with any mammal's milk either. 
<BR><BR>
We are fortunate that most mathematicians were not Jewish. Otherwise, 
it would have been forbidden to divide by all numbers between -1 and 1.

Microsoft's slogan used to be "Microsoft - making it all make sense." <BR>
Today it should be: "Microsoft - making everything make sense. <B>Ours</B>."<BR>
<BR>
And another twist:<BR>
"Microsoft - friendliness is our outstanding quality. No matter how much we
mess up your computer work, we will always consider you our friend."

The prefix "God Said" has the extraordinary logical property of converting
any statement that follows it into a true one.

<h3>Deltas to "Shit Happens" according to Religions:</h3>

<p>
Judaism: God knows you will do shit, does nothing to prevent it, but makes you take
the blame for it anyways.
</p>
<p>
Or alternatively:
</p>
<p>
God is all the shit, all the non-shit and all the intermediate demi-shits in 
between.

A more experienced programmer does not make less bugs. He just realizes

does it also imply that:<br>

I know I'm blond, but I have to colour my hair brown, so people would
not think I'm stupid. Because, like the title of the book says: "You've only
got Three Seconds".

Actaully, since Dad has two books like that, you've only got six seconds.

<h3>Re-inventing the Wheel</h3>

<p>
He who re-invents the wheel, will have a much better understanding how a 
wheel works.

<p>
He who re-invents the wheel, may actually invent a much better wheel.

<p>
He who re-invents the wheel will likely design a square wheel and spend
a year trying to figure out why it doesn't work properly.
