<h2>The Article Itself</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
A new tool aims to revolutionise the way people communicate with
the famous free software evangelist Richard M. Stallman, (also
known by his initials - “RMS”). Its project leader Shlomi Fish has
more to say of it:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>RMS-Lint</b> is called RMS-Lint because like most lints it warns
on many things that are obviously not errors, because there’s a chance
that they are. RMS-Lint is an interactive speller that runs over the
document word by word with a sophisticated look-ahead and look-behind
and warns the user over any word or combination of words that may
irritate Stallman, or otherwise will be frowned upon by him.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>RMS-Lint’s Rules</h3>

<p>
In accordance to the Free Software Foundation‘s
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html">list of
    words to avoid</a> and other documents available on the
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/">FSF Site</a>, the following rules are
recognized by RMS-Lint:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <p>
    Warns on every use of the term “Linux” not preceded by
    “GNU/”. This is due to the fact that Stallman advocates using
    “GNU/Linux” instead of just “Linux” to refer to the entire operating
    system. It especially warns on “the Linux kernel” (because the
    kernel part is redundant as Linux is just the kernel).
    </p>
    <p>
    Legitimate use of the term “Linux” to refer to just the kernel
    are also warned about, but can be overridden.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    Warns on every use of the term “open source” and even the word
    “open”. Replacements are “free software”, “free”, “revealed”,
    “viewable”, and the boatload of synonyms from the
    <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/thesaurus?book=Thesaurus&amp;va=open">the
        Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary</a>. Also warns on the
    terms “closed-source” or “closed”.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    Warns on every use of the term “free” for fear it may be used
    to imply costlessness. As for legitimate uses of the term (“free
    as in free speech”), it should be noted that being a lint,
    RMS-Lint attempts to cover every possible error, not just
    the ones that actually are such. Replacements are “liberal”,
    “libre”, “costless”, “gratis”, and you also have an option to
    ignore it.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    Warns on every use of the term “pirate” or “piracy”. It is our
    belief that when talking to Dr. Stallman, people won’t usually
    wish to talk about the sea-faring robbers, but instead on
    illegitimate copying of one form of media or another. Thus,
    RMS-Lint warns on every such use and suggests the
    alternatives of “illegal copier/copying”, or “buccaneer”.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    Warns on every use of “Intellectual Property” or “IP” (a common
    short form of it). The developers of RMS-Lint realize that IP
    can also mean the “Internet Protocol” (as in “IP address”, “my
    IP is ‘192.168.1.1’”), but we believe that when corresponding to
    RMS, such use will be relatively uncommon, and does not justify
    risking mentioning “intellectual property” to him.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    And much, much more…
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Response to RMS-Lint</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">Eric S. Raymond</a>, a long time
friend of Stallman, and the chief leader of the open source movement,
expressed a great deal of content from the availability of this tool.
“I’ve been waiting for such a thing all my life. Communicating with
Richard has become more and more difficult, and RMS-Lint can easily
make it much better.”
</p>
<p>
Raymond’s long time collaborator <a href="http://perens.com/">Bruce
    Perens</a> also expressed
happiness that RMS-Lint has become available. “Modern-day open source
enthusiasts find it more and more difficult to communicate with Richard
Stallman due to his terminological whims. RMS-Lint is just the tool
that can help them validate their E-mails for RMS’ correctness.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Richard Stallman himself expressed dismay from this
project: “RMS-Lint is an unsatisfying symptomatic cure for
a big problem. People can use this stupid tool to try and communicate
with me effectively, instead of correcting their speech and their
thought patterns, which is the best thing in the long run. I am
appalled by the fact that people even think a machine can correct
what a person should work on himself to do. This makes me so angry!”
