<p>
Here are the recent updates for Shlomi Fish’s Homepage. I know I have not
posted an update to this blog in a while, and in part it’s due to the fact
that I have not done as much work on the site as I have before the previous
update. But there is still some new things to look forward to.
</p>

<p>
There are <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#intersting-vs-successful">some new items on the original aphorisms page</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Sophie:</b> I’m hungry today.<br />
<b>Jack:</b> well, wait until tomorrow - maybe this feeling will pass.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I’m now mirroring the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/English-is-a-Crazy-Language.html">“English
    is a Crazy Language”</a> bit I found somewhere.
</p>

<p>
The fifth installment in the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Newbies/"><i>Perl
        for Perl Newbies</i></a> series of presentations is now available 
online. This part covers good programming practices such as using a version
control system, writing automated tests, and using accessors for objects. As
with the previous parts, this talk is licensed under the Public Domain/CC-Zero.
</p>

<p>
There are new 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/">factoids</a> in the
factoids collection:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    Larry Wall can make shit up, and the computer will understand what he means.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are also many new 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">UNIX-like fortune cookies</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>

        <li><b>mauke:</b> just as keikaku.</li>

        <li><b>rindolf:</b> mauke: OK, now your work for today is done.</li>

        <li><b>pkrumins:</b> NO</li>
    </ul>

<p>
I have added 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/books-recommends/#tdd_by_example">a 
    review of Kent Beck’s <i>Test Driven Development: By Example</i></a>
to the recommended books page.
</p>

<p>
The ABC Path game's generator module is now being mentioned
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/japanese-puzzle-games/abc-path/">in the Games ABC Path page</a>, and the solver
and generator were also ported to JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
More prominent editors and IDEs were added to the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/editors-and-IDEs/">editors 
    and IDEs page</a>.
</p>

<p>
And as usual, there are many additional links on various pages of the site.
