The Equestria north pole: Santa Claus, a large male unicorn pony,
is standing along with the reindeer Rudolph and Randolph by his side,
debrieffing the other reindeer.

]

Santa: OK, everypony, we are going to have a lot of work this year delivering
Christmas presents and Chanukkah coins. If you have any questions, you can ask
my right-hoof reindeer helpers, Rudolph Hitlower and Randolph Hitlower.

+++: Together, we can hopefully make the Selinaverse have a merry Christmas and
a happy Chanukkah again.

Rindolf’s voice: [in a French accent] not so fast!

[

He materialises. The reindeer are startled.

]

Santa: hi, who might you be?

Rindolf: bonjour my frenemies! I am Rindolf “Aim Very High” Hitlower,
Rudolph and Randolph’s evil twin brother. We were separated at birth.
