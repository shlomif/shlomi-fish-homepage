<p>
It is possible to make a functions of your module automatically available
in any other namespace or script that uses it. To do so one needs to
type the following code fragment near the beginning of the module:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/modules/loading/exporting_code.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
What this fragment does is make the module inherit the <code>Exporter</code>
module which is a special Perl module that can export symbols. Then
it declares the special variable <code>@EXPORT</code> which should be filled
with all the functions that one wishes to export.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example which has a module called "Calc" and a script that uses it:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/modules/loading/Calc.pm" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/modules/loading/test_export.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
As you can see, the script invokes the "gcd" function of the "Calc" module
without having to invoke it with <code>Calc::gcd()</code>. Exporting functions
like that should be used with care, as the function names may conflict with
those of the importing namespace.
