«

As an example, we can imagine a young girl to write a funny screenplay
using GitHub or Google Docs which pits
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Emma-Watson/">Emma Watson</a> vs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a>
on who gets to ride <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Princess_Celestia">Princess Celestia</a> next,
with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader">Darth Vader</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haman">Haman</a>
as two "evil", but mutually hating one another, arbiters. Might seem ridiculus,
but if I didn't want entertainment in my life, then I'd go watch grass grow.
It will be a legal and "ethical" minefield, but I'd bet it'd be easier to
follow and more
entertaining than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings"</a>
was even shortly after LotR was written.

Well, I'm a 44 years old man, but I accepted my own challenge…

Discord: Does everypony want to hear a scary story?

The rest: "yes", "sure"

Discord: Alright! So Emma Watson and Kim Kardashian were sitting on
a bench at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin_Square">Rabin Square</a>
in Tel Aviv, going over their social media backlog.

Emma: Hey Kim, check this out: “Basically, there were two sides to the world. There was the entire computer games software industry engaged in a tremendous effort to stamp out piracy, and there was Wobbler. Currently, Wobbler was in front.” [ <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=only-you-can-save-mankind--two-sides">Reference: Terry Pratchett</a> ]
