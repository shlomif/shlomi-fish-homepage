<a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.248655.0">On
this discussion</a> Michael H. Pryor notes that I’m violating the
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/linking.html">Joel on Software
quoting policy</a>. However, I believe that:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Both Joel and the Law Professor he is quoting are wrong on ethical grounds.
See my essay <a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/case-for-file-swapping/">“The Case
for File Swapping”</a> for some things that are wrong with the current
copyright law, and links to more.
</li>

<li>
This article in part may be considered a critique of Joel’s article. As such,
one can say that “fair use” law allows me to quote substantial parts of it.
</li>

<li>
I’d rather build on an existing effort, than write my own incoherent article
from scratch. Joel should take it as a compliment because “Copying is the
sincerest form of flattery”.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I realise that “A man’s will is his honour.”. However, sometimes people wish
for very irrational things. Many of the clauses in the EULAs of software
products are either not enforceable or even not ethical, and I don’t feel that
I need to respect them, even if they exist.

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
This essay gives my thoughts about Joel on Software’s
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BuildingCommunitieswithSo.html">
Building
Communities with Software</a>. The full original article was sent to the Joel
on Software subscribers by E-mail, while the public web version had less
content. I will respond only to the public web version.

<h2 id="text">The Essay Itself</h2>

<p>
Joel Spolsky wrote
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BuildingCommunitieswithSo.html">an
essay titled “Building Communities with Software”</a> back in March, 2003.
He explained there the motivation behind his web forum and why it is so good.
</p>

<p>
In this text, I’d like to comment on some of the claims that Spolsky made
in the essay. First you’ll have to make sure that you’ve read it.
</p>

<h3 id="existing_online_forums">Comments on the Review of the Existing Online Forums</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
On IRC, you can’t own your nickname and you can’t own a channel -- once the
last person leaves a room, anyone can take it over. That’s the way the software
works. The social result was that it was often impossible to find your friends
when you came back the next day, because someone else might have locked you out
of your chat room and your friends might have been forced to choose different
nicknames.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is true for some IRC networks (especially EF-Net) but is not true for many
others. In some IRC networks (such as
<a href="http://www.freenode.net/">Freenode</a>) one can register one’s
nickname using a service named NickServ, and one’s channels using a
service named ChanServ. This eliminates most of the bot wars that plague other
IRC networks.
</p>

<p>
I’ve been chatting on Freenode for many months now, and the presence of these
services, and its general atmosphere, make talking there an absolute joy. I
have had very few problems there.
</p>

<h3 id="email">E-mail</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
Could you make a feature where I check a box that says
“email me if somebody replies to my post?”
</p>
<p>
A. This one feature, so easy to implement and thus so tempting to programmers,
is the best way to kill dead any young forum. Implement this feature and you
may never get to critical mass. Philip Greenspun’s LUSENET has this feature and
you can watch it sapping the life out of young discussion groups
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Despite what Joel said being able to monitor the replies to one’s thread by
E-mail is a very useful feature that should be enabled by default. Otherwise,
people may forget to check what they posted. Also, his argument is weak,
because once someone visits the page to see the reply, he can also do other
things.
</p>

<p>
For forums that aim to give help with a technology, such a feature is a must,
because a person should be notified when something happen, instead of having
to visit the forum times and again. (As someone on
<a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/?joel">the Joel on Software forum</a>
noted.) But even for community software it is a good idea. I know of several
flourishing forums that have this feature.
</p>

<p>
The problem with Joel’s argument is that people cannot monitor O(N)
communities, i.e in proportion to as many as they like. Instead, it is much
more scalable to monitor a constant amount of resources - normally your
E-mail inbox and RSS feeds. Recently I started to rule out various forums
because they don’t provide RSS feeds or have an email feature, and I believe
most people do too.
</p>

<h3 id="branching">Branching</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
Q. OK, but can’t you at least have branching? If someone gets off on a tangent, that should be its own branch which you can follow or go back to the main branch.
</p>
<p>
A. Branching is very logical to a programmer’s mind but it doesn’t correspond to the way conversations take place in the real world. Branched discussions are disjointed to follow and distracting.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Some forums I frequent have a lot of branching and they are very nice. That
way, replies to posts are answered as branched posts, instead of as replies
to the topic that come after many other replies.
</p>

<h3 id="most_recent_reply_first">Promote
Topics with the Most Recent Replies</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
Q. Your list of topics is sorted wrong. It should put the topic with the most
recent reply first, rather than listing them based on the time of the original
post.
</p>

<p>
A. It could do that; that’s what many web-based forums do. But when you do that
certain topics tend to float near the top forever, because people will be
willing to argue about H1B visas, or what’s wrong with Computer Science in
college, until the end of the universe. Every day 100 new people arrive in the
forum for the first time, and they start at the top of the list, and they dive
into that topic with gusto.
</p>

<p>
The way I do it has two advantages. One, topics rapidly go away, so
conversation remains relatively interesting. Eventually people have to just
stop arguing about a given point.
</p>

<p>
Two, the order of topics on the home page is stable, so it’s easier to find a
topic again that you were interested in because it stays in the same place
relative to its neighbours.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I wholeheartedly agree. Forums that promote topics with the most recent reply
to the top, are incredibly annoying, and I usually stop frequenting them after
a short while. Usually, my conversations there disappear to oblivion.
</p>

<h3 id="confirmation">About Posts Confirmation</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
Q. Why don’t you show people their posts to confirm them before you post them?
Then people wouldn’t make mistakes and typos.
</p>

<p>
A. Empirically, that is not true. Not only is it not true, it’s the opposite of
true.
</p>

<p>
Part one: when you have a confirmation step, most people just click past it.
Very few people reread their post carefully. If they wanted to reread their
post carefully, they could have done it while they were editing it, but they
are bored by their post already, it’s yesterday’s newspaper, they are ready to
move on.
</p>

<p>
Part two: the lack of the confirmation step actually makes people more
cautious. It’s like those studies they did that showed that it’s safer, on
twisty mountain roads, to remove the crash barrier, because it makes people
scared and so they drive more carefully, and any way, that little flimsy
aluminium crash barrier ain’t gonna stop a 2 ton SUV moving at 50 mph from
flying off the cliff. You’re better off, statistically, just scaring the
bejesus out of drivers so they creep along at 2 miles per hour around the
hairpins.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I disagree here, especially when the forum is using markup. (see below).
Previewing the post allows one to check if the URLs are OK, and not too long
or that they have dangling characters, and to review the post. A good posting
mechanism should have an optional preview feature.
</p>

<h3 id="other_comments">Other Comments</h3>

<h4 id="markup">Markup</h4>

<p>
The Joel on Software forum has absolutely no markup except for URLs being
highlighted. I think that nevertheless, some forums should allow some markup.
In their case, what they should have is plain and simple HTML, without any
of the following idiosyncrasies:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Link the following words to a URL. (at least not without giving any option of
the “&lt;a” tag).
</li>
<li>
Line breaks (<code>\n</code> characters) cause a new line to start at the post.
(very annoying!)
</li>
<li>
A very limited HTML syntax. Support as broad as syntax as possible optionally
converting tags to more sane tags, but don’t force the user not to input them.
</li>
<li>
Weird tags like square brackets instead of angles.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
HTML is very easy to learn and one can get the hang of it pretty quickly. Many
times, people post markup from web pages they created with HTML, and they’ll be
annoyed if they can’t post it as is.
</p>

<h4 id="operation">Forum Operation</h4>

<p>
Make sure the forum works, that each topic has a permanent page, and that
the preview and all functions work. There are many off-the-wall forums that
tend to not function correctly in various browsers, and have many
idiosyncrasies. It is a good idea to use a stock forum like PHP-BB, YaBB, etc.
that are well tested and extensively used.
</p>

<h4 id="horizontal_scrollbar">Avoid a Horizontal Scroll Bar</h4>

<p>
Avoid horizontal scroll bars. Trim long URLs in your posts, and make sure that
people don’t overflow with large codes in “<code>&lt;pre&gt;…&lt;/pre&gt;</code>”
sections.
</p>

<h4 id="spam_measurements">Spam Measurements</h4>

<p>
Make sure your forum has measurements against spam. Bayesian filtering or a
different spam filter is a good idea. A must is the
<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html"><code>rel="nofollow"</code>
attribute</a> which will render comment spam useless.
</p>

<h4 id="cryptic">Don’t be Cryptic</h4>

<p>
Once a comment I posted to a Movable Type-powered weblog was rejected,
without giving me any idea what was wrong with it. I had to use my intuition
to understand that the reason was the shortened URL I placed there instead of
my long URL which I was afraid would cause a horizontal scroll bar. This was
indeed the case, and after I replaced the shortened URL with the full one
, my comment was accepted.
</p>

<p>
But why wasn’t the reason for the rejection of the post given? That’s a bug!
So don’t be cryptic - if something is wrong let the user know exactly what
that is.
</p>

<h4 id="permanent_urls">Permanent URLs</h4>

<p>
One thing I dislike about the <i>Joel on Software</i> forum is that the URLs
don’t
remain the same. Instead it seems tha the number of posts is appended to them.
That way, one often finds that threads he has already read are marked as
unread again. This is annoying.
</p>

<p>
A better solution would be to display the number of comments added since the
discussion was last visited by that specific reader.
</p>

<h4 id="acceptance">Acceptance of Posts</h4>

<p>
Accepting good posts is a must for a forum. Furthermore, giving the poster
a proper feedback for why his post was rejected, or what he can do to remedy
it is also necessary. I almost gave up on publicising my posts in
<a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> because they routinely rejected
many posts to my essays that I consider to be very good, while accepting
some incredibly weird, rehearsed or low-quality news items.
</p>

<p>
Now, in Slashdot, the post notice just say “rejected”, without any reason
why. So I don’t know how to better improve. An editor I contacted about it
commented that they don’t want to do it because people then will ask questions
about it which will start a dialogue. However, this causes the most avid
contributors to give up on Slashdot, and move to greener pastures.
</p>

<p>
And the dialogue is extremely important. You can always block or ban people
who keep bothering you with extremely low-quality articles, but you shouldn’t
let the ambitious contributor be left with a simple “rejected”. They want to
improve and they want to know why you didn’t like their post. So this is not
a feature - it’s a bug. Several communities - notably
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/">Advogato</a> and the Joel-on-Software
forum, accept almost all posts by default. This can be often very nice.
</p>

<p>
A different thing happened to me with
<a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/">kuro5hin</a>. For once the moderators
there reject posts that are just links to existing articles on the site. This
makes it necessary to format the existing essay in the subset of HTML accepted
by kuro5hin, to forget about getting traffic to your site - a lot of hassle.
</p>

<p>
However, even after I did all that, my article was rejected by the moderation
of the users because they felt that:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
The paragraph in which I described myself
was too long (while being intended for the regular article, and still being a
small amount of the article) - a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_over_substance_fallacy">Style
over substance fallacy</a>.
</li>
<li>
That I was not eligible to post such an article because I had not been very
active in the site before - an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad-hominem">Ad-hominem fallacy</a>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
As a result most of them decided that they wanted to reject my post on the
grounds that it was low-quality. I completely gave up on kuro5hin from then
on.
</p>

<h4 id="the_people">The People</h4>

<p>
Which brings us to another important part: the people who are present and
make up the community.
</p>

<h3 id="finale">Finale</h3>

<p>
During my time, I had and still have to deal with a lot of idiosyncratic
forums. I hope what Spolsky wrote and what I wrote here will help people
build nicer, better and less dysfunctional online forums.
