[Note: This is an E-mail I wrote to someone who opposed the theme of my
"The Case for File Swapping" essay, after I posted it to a writers
mailing list I'm a member of. Later on you can find his response
along with my comments on why it is wrong. I should note that he apparently
did not read the essay.]

How do you know? She could have tried to sell the CDs, and they may have sold
very well. Like I mentioned there, the U.S. band Wilco placed the contents of
a CD online, and later sold it and it became a best-selling CD.

Furthermore, she could have then went on to have a series of live concerts
based on the CD, which also many people would have wanted to see based on the
CD's popularity.

Like I said, artists can still charge for commercial copies of their songs
(CDs sold in Music stores, mp3s downloaded from online stores, etc.) In fact
they can leverage the Internet to cut the middle man.

Yes, but assuming the work is in the public, you cannot prevent its
non-commercial distribution.

You can make as many copies as you wish for your own use - as backups, as
mp3's to put on your computer, as mp3's for your recordings, etc. You can
also non-commercially distribute them to your friends.

You are not obliged to do it by Ethics.

I don't understand. I don't care if people re-distribute and duplicate my
public artworks. They can do it as much as they wish. So, why shouldn't I do
the same for other people's artworks.

Right. Selling Pirated CDs in music stores is illegal and unethical, because
these persons may have prevented non-commercial use. But copying a CD to your
friend, or sharing it over the Internet is perfectly fine.

It's not theft. Indeed, there was a strong opposition to stealing since
antiquity (Hamorabbi's Laws, etc.). However it was for physical, tangible
property: land, houses, precious metals, livestock, tools, food, etc. All
things that have a physical existence and require time and effort to produce
each unit of.

On the other hand, with artworks, you can easily duplicate an infinite copies
at virtually no cost. Furthermore, the original is not harmed in any way. So
copying such an artwork non-commercially is not "theft".

The ancient laws referred to the acts of taking tangible property without
permission while leaving the rightful owner with one less copy of it. In
ancient times, the texts that were made available to the public were freely
distributable, and although sometimes people charged for making one copy
(which was a long process that required hard work), that copy was then also
freely distributable. Copyrights emerged only at post-Renaissance when making
copies of works became extremely cheap, and there was a need to protect the
commercial interests of the authors.

I never justified stealing from the rich or extremely rich.

Like I said before and in the article, I never justified theft and that
non-commercial distribution of copies of artworks is not theft.

If the person creating the work is contributing it to the "Creative
Commons," as you imply you are doing, then fine. If not, then you
shouldn't re-distribute other peoples works, at least in a form that can
permit the work being copied. Broadcasting in the form of internet radio
is okay, since that is the same as inviting your friends over to listen
to music at your house, but if you are collecting advertising revenue or
donations for operating the internet radio you should pay the annual
broadcast licencing fee to the appropriate performing rights association
in you jurisdiction. .

My response: but I've distributed all my public work under such
licenses, and don't care if people make non-commercial copies of them.
So the "Don't do unto others, what you don't want others to do to you"
is false. As far as I'm concerned, people can make as many
non-commercial copies as they like.

Land, houses, livestock, etc. are " tangible property." Works of the
artistic and creative imagination are "intellectual property." That is
why the bureau for recording and registering copyrights in Canada is
entitles The Bureau of Intellectual Property.

My response:

As I noted in my essay in http://xrl.us/h8sq the term "Intellectual
Property" is misleading, harmful and not really equivalent to tangible
property. (I link to an even more comprehensive resource about it). It
has become quite common recently, but only because the holders of
copyright, patents, trademarks, etc. are using it to rationalize
irrational actions based on it.

Have you actually read the essay before you commented?
