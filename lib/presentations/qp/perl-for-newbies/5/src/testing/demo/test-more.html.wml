<p>
Perl ships with a module called Test::More (which is part of the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Simple/">Test-Simple CPAN
distribution</a>, which may be more up-to-date there), that allows one
to write and run tests using convenient functions. Here's an example
for a test script:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/testing/demo/Test-More-1.t" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
<tt>is()</tt> is a Test-More built-in that compares a received result ("have")
to an expected result ("want") for exact equivalence. There are also
<tt>ok()</tt>, which just tests for truthhood, <tt>is_deeply()</tt> which
performs a deep comparison of nested data structures, and others.
</p>

<p>
You may also notice the <tt># TEST</tt> comments - these are 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Count/">Test::Count</a> annotations
that allow us to keep track of the number of tests we've ran and update
it. (So we'll know exactly how many tests we want.)
</p>

<p>
Now, the output of this would be:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
1..7
ok 1 - 0+0 == 0
ok 2 - 2+2 == 4
ok 3 - 4+20 == 24
ok 4 - 20+4 == 24
ok 5 - (-2)+8 == 6
ok 6 - 4+3.5 == 7.5
ok 7 - 3.5+3.5 == 7
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
This is in an output format called <a href="http://testanything.org/">TAP - The
Test Anything Protocol</a>. There are several TAP parsers that analyse the
tests and present the result. For example, we can run the test script using 
the <tt>prove</tt> command-line utility that ships with perl 5:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
$ prove Test-More-1.t
Test-More-1.t .. ok
All tests successful.
Files=1, Tests=7,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.06 usr  0.01 sys +  0.06 cusr  0.01 csys =  0.14 CPU)
Result: PASS
</quadpres_code_block>
