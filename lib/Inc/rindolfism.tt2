Rindolfism is my own personal philosophy and idea system, based on many
influences - both more “serious” ones such as:
</p>

</p>

</ol>

<p>
As well as idea systems / franchises that don’t take themselves as seriously
as those such as:

<p>
These are just some of the major influences on
Rindolfism, but there are many, many more.

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "dynamic_rindolfism" title = "The Dynamic Nature of Rindolfism" %]

<p>
Moreover, Rindolfism is not static - it is <b>dynamic</b> and is constantly
evolving. Since an early age, I have committed myself to be an idealist.
However, my <b>idealism</b> has constantly <b>changed</b>, and my idealism
today is very different from what it was even a year ago, which in turn is
different from what it was two years ago, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, as great as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">philosophy</a> is (including my
own original, or mostly original, amateur philosophy), it just provides general
<b>guidelines</b> for behaviour ( <a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/guidelines_as_dogma.xhtml">Reference</a> ). A man or a woman eventually should use
<b>reason and judgement</b> in leading their life. Making a bad decision and
performing a wrong action, is often <b>better</b> than <b>not doing</b>
anything at all.
</p>

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "rindolfism__howtohelp" title = "How to help?" %]

<p>
Finally, Rindolfism does not need fans and followers as much as it needs
people who will either:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Criticise it.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Build upon it - including mix and match it with other things.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Suggest improvements.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Try to compete with it. Don't try to be No. 2… try to be No. 1!
But <a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#make-your-own-kind-of-music">"make your own kind of music"</a>

it, I will merge it. If I don't, I'll tell you why, and <a

<p>
I am also not planning to write a complete summary of Rindolfism any time soon,
because like I said, it is constantly evolving, and because I don't see
the point. If interested, you can read <a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/">my
essays</a> (some of which are somewhat outdated),
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/">my works of humour and fiction</a> (which are
arguably both more serious, and not as funny as my essays),
the posts on my <a href="[% base_path %]me/blogs/">blogs</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/shlomif">my <b>Twitter</b> feed</a>, and other
Internet
<a href="#shlomif_on_the_web">social media outlets</a> where I have posted
stuff.
</p>

<p>
For some attempts at codifying Rindolfism, see:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
<a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/the-eternal-jew/">“The Eternal Jew”</a> - an old
essay, but still mostly pertinent.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/">“Putting
all the Cards on the Table (2013)”</a> - a newer essay - relevant for 2013,
about which I received mixed opinions, may not be for everyone, and that may
require a lot of revamping.

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "neo_semitism" title = "Neo-Semitism" %]

<p>
A central tenant of Rindolfism is Neo-Semitism, which has been an attempt to
create the same fusion of ideas, cultures, influences, and even blood, that
took place in the Near East by the predominantly
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_people">Semitic peoples</a>
, only this time world wide, with electronic and computer communication
as a facilitator, and with faster land, sea, and air travel.
</p>

<p>
I originally documented the term in
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/Selina-Mandrake/ongoing-text.html#from-dispeller-to-selina">a scene from my screenplay Selina Mandrake</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<b>Mosheh:</b> The so-called <b>New Age</b> is finally arriving, and we are
about to
establish the worldwide <b>Neo-Semitic</b> culture, based on diversity,
cross-pollination, acceptance, tolerance, rationality and life.
</p>

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "rindolfism_canon" title = "The Rindolfism’s Canon" %]

<p>
I noted in a tweet once that:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There’s too much different Anime. There’s only one My Little Pony canon.</a>
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
And indeed there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic">the show</a> that
My Little Pony fans watched from its start up to an arbitrary number of seasons, and a lot of
spin off official and fan/"bootleg" art and merchandise, which are less universally agreed upon
by fans.
</p>

<p>
Other notable canons are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>
for Judaism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppet_Show">The Muppet Show</a>
(as opposed to the more chaotic and repetitive <i>Sesame Street</i>),
and <a href="https://xkcd.com/">the xkcd.com's numbered strips</a>.
</p>

<p>
So without further ado, Rindolfism's canon consists of these resources:
</p>

<li>
<p>

</p>
