        <para>
            Since <link
                xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/">“Putting
                All the Cards on the Table (2014)”</link> was written and
            finalised, I kept linking to individual sections of it, and
            it proved to be popular and many people liked
            individual sections of it, or the essay itself as a whole.
        </para>

        <para>
            One thing I now regret about it
            is the word "All" because I now realise that
            <emphasis role="bold">honesty is
                a process</emphasis>, and so is <emphasis role="bold">enlightenment</emphasis> and if
            you stop searching for a bigger and better “truth”, you
            stop being honest.
        </para>

        <para>
            Nevertheless, after sometime over a year, I feel that a sequel to it
            is in order, collecting and organising a <emphasis role="bold">(hopefully
                large) subset</emphasis> of the various insights I collected
            in many posts and comments on various social media outlets,
            as well as in some stories, screenplays, aphorisms, etc. So here goes.

        <para>
            Many people I know are being far too much misers: they
            care too much about people not spending a small amount
            of money, which in turn will buy them some time, bring
            them joy, or enlighten and/or inspire them. However,
            the time of productive humans, as well as their
            self-esteem and spiritual and tangible possessions, are
            far more important than a small gain of money.
