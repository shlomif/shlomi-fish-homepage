1.1 Rules of the Game
</h1>
<h3 class="notbold">
<ul>
<li>
There are 8 stacks of cards, 4 freecells, and 4 foundations.
The game is played with one deck.
</li>
<li>
At the beginning of play, the cards are dealt to the stacks
(4*7+4*6). The faces of all the cards are visible at the beginning
of play.
</li>
<li>
A freecell can hold one <u>single</u> card.
</li>
<li>
The foundations are built from ace to king and the object of the
game is to move all the cards to the foundations.
</li>
<li>
A card can be placed on top of a card that is of the opposite
colour, and is higher in rank by 1, assuming the latter is at
the top of a stack.
</li>
<li>
An empty stack may be filled with any card.
</li>

An atomic move consists of:
<ul>
   <li>
   Moving a card from a stack to a vacant freecell.
   </li>
   <li>
   Moving a card from a freecell to a parent card on a stack.
