<li>
KDE supports more than one workspace in which one can put windows.
</li>

<li>
You can switch to a different workspace by pressing its number in
the workspaces display at the bottom panel.<br />
<img src="workspaces_pager.png" alt="The KDE Workspaces Display" />
</li>

<li>
When you switch to a different workspace, and return to the original,
you will find all the windows that were opened in the original.
