<p>
The skeleton of the distribution generated by Module-Starter contains some
boilerplate, which is pre-included text and code, used as placeholders. That
should be replaced by more meaningful one by the programmer who is writing
the distribution.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, it also generates a script on <code>t/boilerplate.t</code> that checks
for that boilerplate and reports it. However, the tests there are marked as
TODO tests, whose failure status is ignored by default. To turn off their
TODO status, open <code>t/boilerplate.t</code> in your text editor and remove
or comment-out the following line
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
  local $TODO = "Need to replace the boilerplate text";
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
After we do that, we get some test failures when running <code>./Build test</code>:
