<p>
This is the DocBook/XML for <b>“Rindolf”</b>, a dialect of the Perl
programming language, based on Perl 5, which was originally intended
as an anti-thesis to the direction Perl 6 is going. Since then, I’ve
neglected working on materialising Rindolf, and also discovered that
many features I thought of were already present in Perl 5.

<p>
This SPEC, however, is kept here for posterity.
