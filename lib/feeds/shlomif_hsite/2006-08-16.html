<!-- TITLE=&quot;Define &#39;Zionism&#39;!&quot; + New Revision of &quot;FOSS &amp; Other Beasts&quot;-->
<p>
I added a new Essay <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/politics/define-zionism/">Define 
    "Zionism"!</a> about some ambigious terms relating to the Jewish nature
of Israel. 
</p>

<p>
A second revision of 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/foss-other-beasts/">"Open Source,
    Free Software and Other Beasts" is available</a>.
</p>

<p>
As usual, there are also the regular slew of fixes, and additions (including
new links). I'd like to thank "acid burn" for pointing out a few typos, which
have been fixed.
