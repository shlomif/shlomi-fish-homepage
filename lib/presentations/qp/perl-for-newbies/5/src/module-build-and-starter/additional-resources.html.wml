Here are some additional resources regarding managing a CPAN-like distribution.

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://metacpan.org/release/ExtUtils-MakeMaker/"><b>ExtUtils-MakeMaker</b></a>
is Perl's older and now largely unloved distribution manager, which relies on
generating
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29">makefiles</a>. It was
<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2008/09/msg140206.html">described
by chromatic</a> as <q>a jumble of Perl which
writes cross platform shell scripts to install Perl code, and you customize
that by writing a superclass from which platform-specific modules inherit
pseudo-methods which use regular expressions to search and replace
cross-platform cross-shell code, with all of the cross-platform and
cross-shell quoting issues that entails</q> .

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://metacpan.org/release/Module-Install/"><b>Module-Install</b></a> is
a more modern and succinct wrapper around ExtUtils-MakeMaker that has gained
some popularity. It ships its code (and the code of its extensions) under an
<code>./inc</code> directory in the distribution, which has known to cause some
bootstrapping issues for co-developers who would like to collaborate on the
code from its version control repository. Nevertheless, it may be worth taking a
look.

<p>
<a href="http://www.apress.com/open-source/programming/9781590590188"><b><i>Writing
Perl Modules for CPAN</i></b></a> is a book by Sam Tregar, which has a free
PDF download. It is somewhat out-of-date (only covering ExtUtils-MakeMaker),
but may still be enlightening.

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://dzil.org/"><b>Dist::Zilla</b></a> is a high-level distribution
generator, with many available plugins, that abstracts away a lot of the
duplication within a module and across modules. It generates fully-functional
distributions that can be shipped to CPAN and used normally. As with
Module-Install, it may pose a problem to your contributors, especially if they
have out-of-date versions of its CPAN modules installed, but it is a useful
tool.

A Perlmonks.org post titled
<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=879515"><b>“RFC: How to Release
Modules on CPAN in 2011”</b></a> goes to more coverage about the issues covered
in this section.

<p>
Jeffrey Thalhammer has prepared a talk titled
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/thaljef/cpan-for-private-code">“CPAN for Private Code”</a> which gives the motivation for packaging Perl code in CPAN-like
distributions, even if it is not intended for CPAN.
