A crowded pub in the role-played world. The Blue Rabbits enter.

</p>
<p><strong>Clover:</strong> OK, now that our horses are in the stable, we can get some rest. <span>[Hands
some coins to the pub-man]</span> Meals and drinks for the six of us.

</p>
<p><strong>Guy sitting on a stool at the bar (Guy #1):</strong> hey, I think I recognise you. You’re The
Blue Rabbit Adventuring company, right?
</p>
<p><strong>Clover:</strong> yes, we are. <span>[does a rudimentary bow]</span> Clover, at your service!

</p>
<p><strong>Guy #1:</strong> hell, I ain’t need your service!
</p>
<p><strong>Guy #2:</strong> yeah, we don’t need no adventurers’ service here.

</p>
<p><strong>Guy #1:</strong> yeah, problem with adventurers - they are trouble makers. They create
troubles where none exist before so they can solve them later.
</p>
<p><strong>Guy #2:</strong> yeah! <span>[and he shakes mugs with Guy #1]</span>

I added the text of
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/elephant-in-the-circus/" rel="nofollow">the parable of the Elephant in the Circus</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I once walked to a circus and saw a huge elephant tied to a small poll with a
rope, just standing there. So I wondered why is the elephant so obedient and
doesn’t break away from the stick with all of its enormous strength and mass.
So they told me this story: once when the elephant was very young, it was tied
to the pole the same way. Naturally, it didn’t like that and tried to escape,
but try as it might, the rope and the pole were too strong for it. So the
elephant eventually gave up.

Finally, the section navigation menus of the various sections are now
formatted in a nice, expandable, GUI-like tree (assuming JavaScript is
enabled). If JavaScript is not enabled, there’s a standard HTML fallback. This
