<li>
To have a directory with its own separate <code>configure</code> script, first
put it in the <code>SUBDIRS</code> variable of Makefile.am
</li>

<li>
Then use the <code>AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS</code> macro in <code>configure.in</code> to
configure them as separate sub-directories.
</li>

<li>
If a sub-directory inherits from the same subdirectory, then they will
also be linked against all the shared libraries, which may not be
desirable.
