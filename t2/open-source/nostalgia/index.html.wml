<p>
I found a zip file lying around on the hard disk, containing some source
code files I wrote
back in my DOS days for Turbo C++. It can be downloaded from
<a href="progs/">this directory</a>. The licence for all this code is
MIT X11 licence, but I don’t think it’s worth much, because it’s 16-bit and
may only run on DOS, and there are probably much superior alternatives
<a href="http://freecode.com/">available somewhere</a>.
</p>

<p>
But if you wish to be impressed (or unimpressed) by my programming skills
back at high school, then feel free to check these files out. Here are short
descriptions of some of them:

<define-tag file whitespace="delete">
<preserve name />
<set-var %attributes />
<a href="progs/<get-var name />"><b><get-var name /></b></a>
<restore name />

<ul>
<li id="csee">
<p>
<file name="csee.h" />, <file name="csee.cpp" /> -
C-See - a library of various graphical routines.
</p>
</li>
<li id="ccalc">
<p>
<file name="ccalc.cpp" /> - C-Calc - a library of mathematical and
number theory routines.
</p>
</li>
<li id="gregorian_to_jewish">
<p>
<file name="gtoj.c" />, <file name="gtoj2.cpp" />, <file name="gtoj.h" /> -
some routines to convert dates of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">the
Gregorian Calendar</a> to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar">Hebrew Calendar</a>.
I wrote it for a friend’s school project, in which he wrote a
schedule-management program for schools.
</p>
<p>
I implemented it entirely based on what I read about it in the Hebrew
Encyclopedia. I first used some C++ paradigms, but then converted it entirely
to ANSI C.
</p>
</li>
<li id="bezier">
<p>
<file name="bezier.cpp" /> - a program to generate Bezier Curves.
</p>
</li>
<li id="mandelbroot">
<p>
<file name="mandelbr.cpp" /> - a program to generate the Manelbrot set. (Who
didn’t write something like that?)
</p>
</li>
<li id="cdd">
<p>
<file name="cdd.cpp" /> - a program to change a drive and a directory at
once. Like <tt>cdd d:\progs\tcc</tt>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
