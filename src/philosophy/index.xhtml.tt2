<p>
This section concentrates my articles and
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html">essays</a>, which despite
common belief, are not limited to discussing literature. Note that the
<code>/philosophy/</code> URL component, is a historical relic and many of
these do not fall under what is now considered as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">philosophy</a>. I may
only be considered an
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html">amateur</a> philosopher.
