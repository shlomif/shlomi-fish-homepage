<!-- TITLE=New Look, New Humour Items, Updated Software Pages and More-->
<p>
The biggest news this time is that <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/" rel="nofollow">the
    site</a> has an opossum new look based on an
adapted version of <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/smoked" rel="nofollow">the
    smoked WordPress Theme</a> by iconstantin. There may be some more quirks
lurking in the design, so please report them to me if you find them. I’d also
like to thank <a href="http://www.zoffix.com/" rel="nofollow">Zoffix Znet</a> and other IRC 
people for some insights on how to fix problems I had with adapting the CSS.

<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#what_does_IDK_stand_for" rel="nofollow">There’s
