<p>
When I was in high school, my close family hosted a distant relative,
called Benjy from the U.S.A. who visited Israel. At the time, he seemed
like a friendly, intelligent, and fun young-looking man.

I mentioned him to some of my classmates, and eventually one-of-them asked
me: <q>This Benjy relative of yours - does he keep Kashruth?</q>
