<p>
Conditionals enable us to execute a group of statements if a
certain condition is met. For example the following program, reports to the
user whether or not his name starts with the letter "A":
</p>

<quadpres_code_file filename="src/conditionals/letter_a.pl" />

<p>
The code <code>substr($name,0,1) eq "A"</code> is a condition expression which uses
the perl <code>eq</code> operator, which returns true if and only if the strings
are the same. There are more such operators and they will be explained shortly.
</p>

<p>
Inside the curly brackets following the <code>if</code> there is the code to
be executed by the conditional. That code can be as long as you like. The else
part is executed assuming the conditional was found to be false, and is
optional.
