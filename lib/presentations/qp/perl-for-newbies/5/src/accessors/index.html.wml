<p>
Object accessors are a way to abstract access to an object's member variables 
(also known as "properties", "attributes", "fields", etc.) behind methods
calls. For example we can use <tt>$person-&gt;age()</tt> to get the age
of <tt>$person</tt> and <tt>$person-&gt;age(21)</tt> or 
<tt>$person-&gt;set_age(21)</tt> to set their age to 21.

Accessors provide several important advantages over accessing the
properties of objects directly and this section will serve as an introduction
to them.
