The <tt>sprintf</tt> can be used to format a format string with some 
conversions embedded inside, and some paramters. Each conversion is specified
by the starting character of the percent sign (<tt>%</tt>), and can 
have a type and several parameters that will dictate how it will be formatted
in the output string. The output string is returned by <tt>sprintf</tt>.

Here's an example that illustrates its use:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/sprintf/sprintf1.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
The output is:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
Hello "Nathan"! Your lucky number is 65.
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
As you can see, the first conversion is taken from the first argument, and the
second one from the second argument. That's how sprintf works: processing
the conversions from the arguments in order.
