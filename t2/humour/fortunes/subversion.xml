selfless work others have done on subversion for my own personal
advantage. The problem is, as soon as I read HACKING and learn how to
submit a patch and begin by contributing something as tiny as a FAQ fix,
I'll be hooked, and I'll start to become a contributing member of
society. Next, I'm afraid I'll want to tackle a bite-sized task and help
fix bugs and develop the product. (You guys are so sneaky!!)  :-)

patch...")

a friend of mine runs a small restaurant and wants to professionalize his 
IT. Our idea was to store everything in subversion (we use Debian with svn 
1.3). We had absolutely no problems with the 2D objects, converting recipes 
to ASCII and storing them was peanuts. However the 3D objects are giving us 
a headache - the forks and knifes are stuck in the keyboard, we even 
destroyed a floppy drive trying to read an apple. 
 
Any ideas how we can still use SVN to store everything?

          <text><![CDATA[Linus isn't saying that CVS and Subversion have fixable bugs or missing
features. It's not about the code.

He is saying that they solve the wrong problem. The Subversion team wants to
solve Problem A, and Linus wants to solve Problem B. No amount of code will
turn the solution to Problem A into a solution for Problem B. Bothering the
Subversion team with code addressing Problem B will only irritate them, since
they're working on Problem A.

The right way to handle differing goals is to start a different project. That's
what he did.

Don't be confused by the labels. Source Code Management means different things
to different people, and there isn't always much overlap in how each person
defines it. Ships and airplanes are both 'vehicles', but that doesn't mean that
a few changes will turn one to the other.

His argument is that it may destroy binary files.

This is bogus since keyword-substitution is *off* by default.
It will occur only for files that were explicitly marked for
substitution. For example in subversion:

       svn propset svn:keywords "Id Author Revision" *.h *.c

As a substitute (pun intended) for the lack in this feature he gives
a hand crafted, build system dependent, manual (i.e: error prone) method.

What a lame excuse.
