<h2>Tabs and Whitespace</h2>

<points>
<li>
There is a special character called "Tab" whose ASCII value is 9. It is
usually displayed as several adjacent whitespace characters.
</li>
<li>
In some file-types (most notably Makefiles) tabs have a special meaning and 
cannot be substituted with their equivalent whitespaces. 
</li>
<li>
They would even reject a whitespace before the tab. (which often looks
identical to a tab).
</li>
<li>
Thus it is important to make sure your editor is configured so it inputs
tabs at such files.

<h2>Carriage Returns</h2>

<points>
<li>
On Linux and other UNIX systems, the lines of text files are terminate with 
a single character called 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_feed">"Newline" or 
"Linefeed"</a>.
</li>
<li>
In DOS, and Windows, the Linefeed character is preceded by another character
called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return">Carriage 
Return</a>.
</li>
<li>
The problem is that some Linux tools will not tolerate CRs at the end
of lines, so they have to be removed somehow.
</li>
<li>
You can use the following command: <tt>perl -pi -e 's/\r$//' [files]</tt>
to convert files from DOS-style to Windows-style.
</li>
