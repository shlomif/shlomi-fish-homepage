<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Emma-Watson-Visit-to-Israel-and-Gaza/">“Emma
Watson’s Visit to Israel and Gaza”</a> is a work-in-progress
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_person_fiction">Real Person
fiction</a> screenplay which aims to bring
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalom">Shalom</a> to the turbulent
Gaza Strip/Israel border:

<p><strong class="sayer">Waitress:</strong> I hope you’re having a good time, ah…
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">EmWatson:</strong> Emma… Emma Watson!
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Waitress:</strong> Oh! I heard about you, naturally. Are you gonna threaten me with
a wand? Heh!
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">EmWatson:</strong> A wand… yes, the bane of my existence. I’m thinking of collecting
money for a public campaign to convert the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#evolution_of_girls_w_weapons">weapon
most associated with me</a> to something more menacing.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Waitress:</strong> Don’t you have enough money for that?
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">EmWatson:</strong> No, not enough! Heh. And money isn’t everything.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Waitress:</strong> So you’re not playing in films for money?
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">EmWatson:</strong> Playing in films for money? Of course not! What a preposterous idea.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Waitress:</strong> Ah, nice.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">EmWatson:</strong> I’m playing in films for <strong class="bold">a shitload</strong> of money!

<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/So-Who-The-Hell-Is-Qoheleth/">“So,
who the Hell is Qoheleth?”</a> - is a new illustrated screenplay that tells
what I imagine to have happened to the author of
the Biblical book of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes / Qoheleth</a>
shortly after he has written it. The timing is appropriate because Ecclesiastes
is being read during the upcoming
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkot">Sukkot</a> Jewish holiday.
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Anyway, can you share some details about your trip? I never ventured
a long way past Damascus.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Sure! It was very interesting. Most interesting.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> We travelled with our own people and some Greek merchants, all the way
to Athens, and there we hitchhiked a ride with some
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_people">Assyrian</a> merchants,
hoping it will get us closer to Alexandria. There were some guards escorting
us, and at one point they disarmed us and threatened us at sword’s point to
have sex with them or else they'll kill us and take all our possessions.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Wow! Rape. So what did you do?
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Well, we consulted between ourselves and after a long while of being
really scared, we calmed down a little, and decided that if we are forced to
have sex, we might as well cooperate and try to enjoy it. So we told them
that we’ll do it willingly and they agreed.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> How clever of you! And then what happened.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Well, the three of us and her lover each found their own part of the
woods, and we had sex. Then, after one or two times, the three men all
lost stamina, while we were not completely satisfied and cried for more!
</p>
<p>
[
Josephus laughs.
]
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Alexis:</strong> Yes! Then we heard each other’s cries and we gathered at one place
together still naked with our clothes as cover, and we bitched about the whole
situation - in Greek - and the men stood there ashamed.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Yes! Anyway, we continued as couples throughout the trip and the men
got better in love making as time went by, and they also taught us a little
Aramaic. Then we arrived at the junction
- they wanted to go to Assyria, and we wanted to head more south, and then
all the 6 of us were completely emotional and offered each other to escort them
on the way, so we won’t part, but we eventually cared enough about the
others to let them go on their own way.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Wow! That sounds like love.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Love! Yes! That’s the word.

“Talk Like a Pirate Day” is the only day of the year when Chuck Norris only
talks like a pirate, and does not actually act like one.

<p>
On Yom Kippur (= the Jewish Day of Atonement), Chuck Norris forgives God for
his sins.
</p>

<p>
Chuck Norris once refactored a 10 million lines C++ program and was done by
lunch time. It then took Summer Glau 5 minutes to write the equivalent Perl
10-liner.

The screenplay
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Buffy/A-Few-Good-Slayers/">Buffy: A Few Good Slayers</a> has some new scenes:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[
Faith is teaching Becky and the rest of the class how to throw knives.
]
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Becky, it’s nice that you hit the mark three times in succession,
but you’re not always holding the knife correctly.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> OK, Ms. Harris. Can you show me how to do that again? <span class="inlinedesc">[She prepares
her phone.]</span></p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> OK, here goes.
</p>
<p>
[
Cut to the bullseye - three knives hit it quickly.
]
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> How´s that?
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> That’s very nice, but as my mobile‘s video demonstrates, you didn’t
hold the knife “correctly” (in quotes) once.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Let me see. <span class="inlinedesc">[She watches the video.]</span> Oh crap.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Becky, Becky… you have a lot of potential. You’re more than a pretty
face.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Heh, I knew that I have potential, but do you really think I have
a pretty face?
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> If my opinion as a straight, married, woman, matters, I think you do.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Thanks, Ms. Harris.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> OK, class dismissed. Please try to practise at your free time, we’re
going to have a test soon.
</p>

The students rise up and leave.
