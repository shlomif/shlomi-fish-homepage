After I finished writing my <a href="$(ROOT)/humour/human-hacking/">"The Human 
Hacking Field Guide" Story</a> I was looking for a page layout to make it more
interesting. A search on <a href="http://www.oswd.org/">Open Source Web
Design</a> yielded the 
<a href="http://www.oswd.org/viewdesign.phtml?id=1959&amp;referer=%2Fsearch.php%3Fsearchstring%3Dtwin%2Btriangles%26tab%3Ddescription">Twin
Triangles</a> theme which I liked. However, it included other elements to 
the page that I did not need, and I wanted to have a simple rounded 
rectangular frame, without all the other decorations above and below.
</p>

<p>
After trying to create the missing elements on my own using 
<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The GIMP</a>, I decided to create my own 
equivalent from scratch.
</p>

<p>
What I did was the following:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Create a 800*600 image in the GIMP.
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a suitable gradient using the GIMP's gradient editor</p>
<img src="gradient.png" 
alt="The Gradient as edited by the GIMP Gradient Editor"
style="margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p>
The gradient was created based on colours picked from the original image using
the GIMP colour picker. Here is <a href="Twin-Triangles.ggr">the final 
gradient file for download</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Select a large rectangular frame in the middle.
</li>
<li>
Invoke the GIMP round corners script. 
("&lt;Image&gt; &rarr; Select &rarr; Round")
</li>
<li>
Fill the rounded frame with the colour black.
</li>
<li>
Apply the "Gaussian Blur" effect with a large radius (identical in X and in Y) 
to the Image. This gives a nice rounded-rectangle black-to-white gradient.
</li>
<li>
Invoke the GIMP Gradient Map 
("&lt;Image&gt; &rarr; Filters &rarr; Colors &rarr; Map &rarr; Gradient Map").
This gives <a href="final-image.png">the final image</a>.
</li>
<li>
Afterwards, all that is left to do is to slice and dice the image 
appropriately. A horizontal strip from the middle which was a few pixels high
was ideal as a background for most of the page. Then, I took the upper and 
lower parts (until the width of the inner frame stabilizes), and created 
separate images out of them.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The final result is not identical to the original, but it looks very crisp
and I'm quite happy with it. I thought that a blur may make it better, but
it only seemed to have made it worse, so I abandoned the idea.
