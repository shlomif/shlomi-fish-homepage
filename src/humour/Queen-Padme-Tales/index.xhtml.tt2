<ul>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ox_Tales">Ox Tales</a> - inspired
the name and the rough format.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_I_The_Phantom_Menace">Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace</a> (as well as Star Wars IV-VI)-
inspired the characters of Queen Padmé, Obi-Wan Kenobi, <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Qui-Gon_Jinn/Legends">Qui-Gon Jinn</a>, Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker, etc.
</p>

<p>
Do note that Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker are two different characters
here.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Con_Man_(web_series)"><i>Con Man</i></a> -
inspired the web series format. Do note that I feel, but did not prove yet,
that it would have been better as [% RPF %] about the real stars of
<i>Firefly</i>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic"><i>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</i></a> - we reuse characters and concepts
from it, e.g: as Padmé's "spirit friends".
</p>

<p>
The characters were forked roughly from those at the end of MLP's
<a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Season_7">7th season</a>,
after which I stopped watching the show's canon.
</p>

<p>
Note that <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Discord">Discord</a>
in <i>Queen Padmé Tales</i> is distinct from
the Selinaverse's Q, even though they are both based on the Star Trek
Q character.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/recommendations/films/#spaceballs">Spaceballs</a>
- is featured in the 2nd episode as an allegory to the real Earth.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse">Selinaverse</a>:
my crossover world (loosely based on an imaginary reality I believed was
true during a Mania episode in the late 1990s).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=smg-about-giving-back-money-and-time">Quote of Sarah Michelle Gellar ( SMG ) about giving back money and time</a> - "what you get in return is sevenfold". Inspired Padmé's frustration with her bank balance getting larger.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexlee/porque-no-los-dos">The "Porque no los dos" / "Can't we have both?" meme</a>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne%27s_World_(film)">Wayne’s World</a> - Wayne and Garth appear as the "plot programmers".
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Missiles_vs_Melee_Motif/">Missiles vs Melee Motif</a> - inspired the first stanza.
</p>
</li>

<p>
They are a reference to <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexlee/porque-no-los-dos">the "Porque no los dos" / "Can't we have both?" meme</a>
which originated in a commercial for Tacos. <a href="https://github.com/xtaran">A friend</a>
told me about the meme, and it proved to be a catalyst for the first scene, and an
inspiration for the general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universalism">Universalist</a>
and <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=larry-wall-all-truth-is-gods-truh">pluralist</a>
tangent to the series.
</p>

<p>
I found the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/7927684@N03/6306095903">tacos photo (by jeffreyw)</a>
in a Flickr search and it was both high-quality, depicted tacos
with many toppings,
and was under an acceptable Creative Commons licence.
As a result, I decided to use it as a logo.
