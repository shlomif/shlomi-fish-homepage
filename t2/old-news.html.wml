<h3 class="newsitem">30-Oct-2004</h3>

<p class="newsitem">
Added the <a href="$(PATH_TO_ROOT)open-source/bits.html">Open-Source Bits and
Bobs page</a>. Added the
<a href="$(PATH_TO_ROOT)work/academic/Thermo/Material-Summary/">material summary
for the Thermodynamics course I took in the Technion</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="newsitem">12-Oct-2004</h3>

<p class="newsitem">
The site has a new URL, which should cause less name-service resolution
problems. The new domain is
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">http://www.shlomifish.org/</a>. The
old domain will redirect to the new one.
</p>

<p class="newsitem">
The site has seen a major revamp in the last couple of days. Here is a list
of the most important changes and news:
</p>

<ol class="newsitem">
<li>
I added the <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/">“Stop Software Patents!”</a> nag
image to all my pages and a top frame to the front page.
</li>
<li>
There’s a new code for the navigation menu. The old code was an unholy mess,
and the new code is a pure Perl one, which makes the nav-menu much easier
to maintain.
</li>
<li>
Thanks to the new navigation menu code, there are now Mozilla/Firefox
navigation links, that allow traversing the site page by page. For those who
are unfortunate enough not to use these browsers, some rudimentary arrows were
added above the navigation menu.
</li>
<li>
I now have an Uber-kitchy leading path of the page sections and sub-sections at
the top.
</li>
<li>
I’m now <a href="work/private-lessons/">giving private lessons</a> in
high-school subjects and computer-related topics.
</li>
</ol>

My <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/shlomif/">Advogato Diary</a>
is back online, with several new entries posted since Advogato was restored.
I also conducted <a href="open-source/interviews/sussman.html">an
interview with Ben Collins-Sussman</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="newsitem">17-Feb-2004</h3>

<p class="newsitem">
The URL of my homepage has changed. The new URL is <a href="http://shlomi.il.eu.org/">http://shlomif.il.eu.org/</a>. The old URLs will work for the near
future, but not permanently. <a href="shlomif.il.eu.org-questions.html">Read
more about it</a>.
