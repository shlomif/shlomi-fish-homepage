Goals:
    An ANSI C Library (and some stand alone command line programs) for
    Solving Freecell and several similar Solitaire games.

    Aims for:
    * Modularity
    * Speed
    * Reduced Memory Consumption
    * Smart Algorithms

History:

    * Project was started in March 2000, as a way to see if an idea I
    had for solving Freecell would work. Shortly after, version 0.2.0
    was released.

    * It evolved through several major versions since then, and is now
    at stable version 2.8.6 and development version of 2.9.9.

    * It was so far integrated into three Freecell implementations:
    KDE's kpat, Freecell Pro, and Freecell 3d.

Architecure:
    * A collection of the encountered states. (= layouts of the board)

    * On one such collection several DFS and Best-First Search scans operate.

    * Support for Meta-moves and Atomic Moves through Test Functions.

To Do's:
    * Incorporating Patsolve's Logic.

    * Thread Enabling.

    * Writing an Automatic Testing Framework

    * Safety from Failed Memory Allocations
