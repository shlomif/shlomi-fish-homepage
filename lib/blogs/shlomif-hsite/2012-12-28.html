<h2>What’s New on Shlomi Fish’s Homepage</h2>

<!-- TODO : Add tags.
-->

<p>
Here are the recent updates for Shlomi Fish’s Homepage. Most of the work this
time was done on the look, feel, and infrastructure of the site, such as the
navigation menus, but there is still some new (and hopefully interesting)
content. So without further ado, here is what is new:
</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
The main navigation menu to the right now comprises of most of the pages that
were navigable and previously were present only in the section navigation menus.
Since its HTML markup was quite excessive, I decided to load most of the
content using an <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">AJAX </a> (=
“Asyncrhonous JavaScript And XML” or “XMLHTTPRequest”) fetch of a JSON
document, while keeping a smaller subset still usable as plain HTML for
browsers with JavaScript disabled and for search engines and other web user
agents.
</p>

<p>
I made sure that the expansion state of the navigation menu is preserved
between the pages. Moreover, the much maligned section navigation menus are now
hidden by default, but can be enabled using the button and should remember
their state between pages.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
There is a new <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/HTML-Tutorial/">HTML Tutorial in Hebrew</a>
under work. Currently, there is only one section, and some aspects of it are lacking.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
There is a new
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/text-processing-tools/">list
of text processing tools</a> and
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/networking-clients/">a list of networking clients</a> in the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/">software
resources section</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I added new quotes to the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">fortune cookies collection</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<li><b>Yaakov: </b>I LOVE YOU ALL WITH A GREAT HUGE LOVE</li>
<li><b>rindolf: </b>Yaakov: HOW MUCH DOES YOUR GREAT HUGE LOVE COST?</li>
<li><b>Yaakov: </b>It&#39;s on offer half price today.</li>
<li><b>rindolf: </b>Yaakov: I WILL OFFER YOU 200,000 VIRTUAL DOLLARS FOR YOUR GREAT HUGE  LOVE.</li>
<li><b>Yaakov: </b>The regular price is free of charge.</li>
<li><b>rindolf: </b>Yaakov: oh nice.</li>
<li><i>* rindolf buys Yaakov&#39;s GREAT HUGE LOVE.</i></li>
<li><b>rindolf: </b>I LOVE YOU ALL WITH YAAKOV&#39;S GREAT HUGE LOVE.</li>

<p>
The third version of my essay
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/foss-other-beasts/">“Open source,
Free software, and Other Beasts”</a> is now live. It was converted from
DocBook 4 to DocBook 5 and greatly enhanced.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Also new is the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/countdown/">countdown
program</a> which is similar to the UNIX sleep command, only displays the
amount of time remaining.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There’s a new and open source
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/japanese-puzzle-games/binary-puzzle/">solver for the so-called “Binary Puzzles”</a>. It is still
incomplete.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
There is a new geek song parody (under work) titled
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Can-I-SCO-Now/">“Can I SCO Now?”</a> sang to
the music of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx4YdVmhwoM">Jennifer Love Hewitt’s “Can I Go Now?”</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Can I SCO now?<br />
Sue who you wanna sue,<br />
it doesn't matter anyhoo,<br />
it's time to litigate.<br />
Can I SCO Now?<br />
Say what you wanna say,<br />
we don't care anyway,<br />
we're going to inflate.
</p>

<p>
Can I, can I, SCO now….
</p>

I now mirror the Fountainhead parody
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/the-fountainhead-starring-skull-force/">“The Fountainhead

<p>
Support for the <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax
JavaScript library</a> was added to the pages in the

enabling most modern JavaScript-enabled browsers to pretty view the mathematical
formulae there.
