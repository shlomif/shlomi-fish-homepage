<!-- TITLE=Fortune Cookies Revamp and &quot;High-Quality Software&quot;-r2-->
<p>
The <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">fortune cookies 
    collection</a> was completely revamped: the fortunes
were converted to a richer XML grammar, and I added a lot of formatting and 
meta-information to them. They can now be individually linked to. 
Right now, there is no converter from the XML grammar back to plaintext 
(only to XHTML), so the plaintext versions are less up-to-date.
</p>

<p>
There's now 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/high-quality-software/rev2/">a second revision of the essay "What Makes Software High-Quality?"</a>
with many corrections and additions:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        Why is high quality in software important? Low-quality software
        applications will require the users or end-developers to work
        around their bugs and limitations, write a lot of extra functionality
        themselves, and as a result, duplicate a lot of effort and
        cause a lot of frustration and unhappiness. This is assuming
        they don't give up on it soon or right away, and end up looking
        for something else.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
New text has been added to the work-in-progress screenplay
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">Star
    Trek: "We, the Living Dead"</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Worf:</strong> so Mr. Abramovich... I mean, Prof. Abramovich... I mean - Your
Majesty!
</p>

<p><strong>Shlomo:</strong> Mister, Doctor, Professor, General, Admiral, Duke, Baron, Count,
Earl...
</p>
<p><strong>Mosheh:</strong> Fellow of the Royal Society!
</p>
<p><strong>Shlomo:</strong> indeed. Nasi, Rabbi, Rav, Emir... you name it - I had it. Just call
me Shlomo.

</p>
<p><strong>Worf:</strong> I see. Mr. Shlomo.
</p>
<p><strong>Dvorah:</strong> men, I tell you - overachievers, and always need to travel. I stayed
most of the time here.

Added <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a> and 
<a href="http://reddit.org/">Reddit</a> buttons to the top of all the
pages, to facilitate submitting and ranking using them.

<p>
The individual HTMLs generated from DocBook/XML are now styled better
and link to the main site. Furthermore, the DocBook/XML <tt>.xml</tt>
sources now have a CSS stylesheet attached to them to enhance
viewing them directly. (Thanks to the <a href="http://www.badgers-in-foil.co.uk/projects/docbook-css/">docbook-css project</a>.)

<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/#xhtml_11">A question to
    the FAQ about why I'm using XHTML 1.1</a> has been added.

Some links have been added to the
