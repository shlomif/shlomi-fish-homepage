<latemp_subject "Welcome to Linux - Basic Use" />

<p>
This is a <a href="http://welcome.linux.org.il/">"Welcome to Linux"</a>
Presentation for teaching the basic use of Linux. It was later superceded by 
the <a href="$(ROOT)/lecture/W2L/Blitz/">Blitz presentation</a> (written 
in the Hebrew language), but this presentation may still be of interest.
