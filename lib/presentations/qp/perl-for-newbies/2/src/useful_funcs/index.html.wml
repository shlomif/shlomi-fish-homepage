#include 'template.wml'



<p>
Perl has many functions that allow batch operations on entire arrays. Those
functions are not only convenient, but are also faster than unrolling them
into <tt>for</tt> and <tt>foreach</tt> loops.
</p>

<p>
This behaviour is sometimes referred to as the <b>perl pipeline</b> because
it resembles the pipeline used by the UNIX shells.
