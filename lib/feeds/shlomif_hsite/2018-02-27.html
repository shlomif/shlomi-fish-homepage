<!-- TITLE=New Guides, fortune-mod maintenance, Project Euler, and Humour-->
<p>
Here are the recent updates for <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi
Fish’s Homepage</a>.

<ol>

<li>
<p>
On 1 April 2017, I published a feature:
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Atom-Text-Editor-edits-2_000_001-bytes/">“The Atom Text Editor has been Able To Edit a 2,000,001 Bytes-Long File”</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I recently resumed maintenance of
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/fortune-mod/">fortune-mod</a>, an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)">the Unix fortune program</a> for Linux and other systems. Versions 2.0.0
and 2.2.1 were released with many improvements, and we welcome further contributions.
</p>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/how-to-share-code-for-getting-help/">“How to share code online for getting help with it”</a> is
a new guide I am maintaining under the CC-by licence.
</p>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/web/validate-your-html/">“Validate Your HTML”</a> aims to educate the world about the importance of
having valid web markup. It is also under CC-by.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I now have a page about
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/problem-sets-and-cp/project-euler/">my Project Euler solutions and progress</a>. Project Euler is
a site for mathematical problems which are allowed to be solved by programming.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
There are new
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/">factoids</a>,
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#prog_lang_mult">aphorisms</a>
and <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">quotes in fortune
format</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Take your schedule estimates and multiply them by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi">Pi</a>. Take your expected profits and divide them by Pi.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
(My father’s mentor’s advice.)

<p>
Hope you enjoy all that!
