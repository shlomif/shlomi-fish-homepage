<li>
GIMP 1.4, which will be developed in the 1.3.x branch, will have the GUI 
separated from the core, will be ported to Gtk+ 2.0 and will have several 
other relatively minor enhancements.
</li>

<li>
GIMP 2.0 will have CMYK support, 16-bits per color value support, and many
other features. It will use the newly developed 
<a href="http://www.gegl.org/">GEGL</a> 
library as the basis
for its core.
