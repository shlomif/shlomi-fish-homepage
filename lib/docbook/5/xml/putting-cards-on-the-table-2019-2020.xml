<info><title>Introduction</title></info>

<para>
This essay aims to present a summary of a snapshot as of 2019 of my personal
philosophy and ideology, titled
<link xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/#rindolfism">Rindolfism</link>,
which is dynamic and subject to change.
</para>

<para>
It largely builds upon a previous essay titled <link xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/">“Putting all the Cards on the Table (2013)”</link>
</para>

<para>
I am really tired of having truly intellectual people like me "speak in
riddles" and be somewhat dishonest, so I'd like to put as many of the cards I
have now on the table. There will likely be more into the future, and moreover,
honesty is a process and a person should strive to become more honest as time
goes by.

<title>"Live and let live; do and let do"</title>
</info>

<para>
While it had earlier occurrences, I derive this piece of wisdom from <link
xlink:href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/">Saladin</link>,
a Muslim king and conqueror of Kurdish descent who is legendary for being one
of the most effective warriors, and one ofthe most noble and merciful people in
history.
</para>

<para>
During Saladin's time <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)">Palestine</link>
which is also known as "The Land of Israel" or "The Holy Land" was ruled and
terrorised by the <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar">Knights
Templar</link>. These were Christian conquerors originating from Europe, who
were psychotic, psychopathological, vicious, sadistic, and vandalist, who would
have put <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany">the
Nazis</link> much less today's <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</link> or <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant">ISIL</link>
to shame, and harmed the civilians in Palestine and were feared by them.
</para>

<para>
Saladin acquired a large army of loyal warriors, who all joined him by choice,
had superior swords to those of the Knights Templar, and lighter armour, and he
set out to release Palestine from the Knights fortress by fortress.  But the
most amazing thing is that he told the knights something like that:
</para>

<blockquote>

<para>

You can fight me or you can surrender. The choice is yours. Do what you want,
you don't have to do what you think you must. If you choose to surrender, I
will spare your life, disarm you and let you walk to Christian-controlled
territory. If you choose to fight, I will try my best not to kill or harm you,
and then swear you not to fight me any more, and let you walk to
Christian-controlled territory.

</para>

<para>

I trust you will make the right decision and entrust you with power.
Whatever your choice will be, I'll accept it.

</para>

</blockquote>

<para>
While some knights were probably killed, many of them survived and became
happy, sane, and while ostensibly Christian, unwilling to fight Saladin.  Even
if their religious leaders told them to return, Saladin told them he is OK with
the oath breaking and said he'll fight them again. This caused his Knights
Templar opponents to fight extremely poorly, and be quickly disarmed.
Following that, they learned their lesson, and would not fight Saladin again.
</para>

<para>
By letting people do what they want, they will likely do the best thing
they can do. This is management by not managing and parenting by not
parenting, which is and always was the best way.
</para>

        <section xml:id="big-minded-vs-small-minded">
        <info>
        <title>Big minded ("Rosh gadol") vs. Small minded ("Rosh qatan")</title>
        </info>
        <para>
        The Israeli military was small and as there was a lot of work to do
        to properly secure the Israeli civilians it coined the terms
        <link xlink:href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/12/06/news-45/">Rosh
        gadol ("big minded") and Rosh qatan ("small minded")</link>
        to encourage the soldiers to take initiative and try to perform their
        jobs as well as possible, regardless of the fact they were paid little.
        </para>
        <para>
        This extends to non-military work, government work, and voluntary work
        or hobbies and endeavours: if you care about something, do it as well
        as possible and give it enough time as needed. It will get easier and
        faster in time.
        </para>

        <para>
        For instance, a vendor on a candy store or an icecream parlour, should
        try to greet the customers, be friendly to them, offer recommendations
        to them if they ask, accept business cards with their personal web
        sites or social media presence and visit them, and generally treat
        every customer like royalty.
        </para>

        <para>
        If you do this, you'll likely get more returning customers, bigger tips,
        bigger bonuses and raises, and you may be able to land a better job
        based on a warm recommendation from your superiors and coworkers.
        </para>

        <para>
        The opposite is just following orders blindly, "I just work here"
        attitude, which is no different from the Nazis'
        <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders">Superior
        orders - "I was only following orders"</link> which leads to laziness,
        stagnation, vandalism and sadism, just like the German Nazis in World
        War II, or the Knights Templar in Saladin's time.

        </para>

        <para>
        If you care enough about a task, invest the time to do it well.
        It should get quicker and easier and the results will be better and
        more "professional" in due time.
        </para>

<para>
In the book <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers">The
Three Musketeers</link>, Dumas tells the story of how d’Artagnan who is a young
swordsman without much of an official training, from a remote region of France,
eventually becomes the best fighter in France. This is despite the fact that
his peers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, have much more experience and training.
</para>

<para>
It may seem farfetched, but before the industrialisation of the Far East,
and the way the West interpreted martial arts, with the coloured belts and
all, there were regional masters of these arts, who practised them as much as
they could and honed their skills. However, despite all that, they never ruled
out that they would one day fight against someone who never faught before,
and lose.
</para>

<para>
It took me more than a year to write <link
xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/">The Enemy and How I
Helped to Fight it</link> which was my first real story, but it took me about
two weeks to write <link
xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/"><emphasis>Summerschool
at the NSA</emphasis></link>. This is whereas the screenplay for the film
Spaceballs took <link

</para>

<para>
Similarly, it took Bob Dylan less than 20 minutes to write <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowin%27_in_the_Wind">"Blowin' in
the Wind"</link> which is considered a masterpiece, but he likely wrote many
lesser songs before that.

        <para>
        As you may have read, <link
        xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#david_and_goliath">David
        who fought Goliath was a hacker</link> and it was modernised in <link
        xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anEuw8F8cpE">the famous
        scene from Indiana Jones</link> where Indy shoots a master swordsman
        using a gun instead of struggling with him. Hacking or heroism involves
        breaking or bending as many invisible rules as possible and not
        accepting your "fate" (which is usually death) and this applies both to
        fiction and to real life.
        </para>

        <para>
        The opposite of hacking is conformism where you accept all the
        normative rules of society, fear your own shadow, and stagnate and die,
        possibly by <link

        many innocent people's lives with you</link>.

        <para>
        As a result, eccentricity and "craziness" are the road to a happy life,
        not conformism as widely believed.

        A great hacker is an action hero that is aware enough of the essence of
        hacking to become a greater and greater hacker, despite whatever
        limitations he or she may have, and despite whatever setbacks they
        may run into.
        </para>

        <para>
        Note that some great hackers were clearly fictional (e.g:

        <para>
        Despite common belief what happens when you put a great hacker (whether
        male or female) in a secluded place with many minor hackers or
        conformists, is not one crushed great hacker, but rather many great
        hackers, who spend time effort and conscious thought on satisfying
        their customers, peers and superiors. That is the "fox in a chickens'
        coop" motif as exemplified in <link
        xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_(Genesis)">the story
        of Joseph in prison in the Bible</link>, and that of <link

        <para>
        I, Shlomi Fish, have done the same in real life in a top security
        Israeli psychiatric ward where I was hospitalised for being non
        normative, and for doing some foolish stuff. It worked surprisingly
        well, and I've used the collected wisdom of Moses→Saladin→Ayn Rand→the
        Beatles→Sesame Street→web 2.0 blogs and sites→My Little Pony / Taylor
        Swift and my own intuition and trial and error.
        </para>


<para>
It took me about 6-to-8 weeks, and I suffered from the conditions of the
hospital, but otherwise was able to hone my skills in benevolent psychological
warfare, and also started writing some essays with my limited computing
resources there.

        <para>
        Traditionally in history some great hackers have become so powerful
        that they took over the direction of the world and became a singular
        source of greatness. This is even though some of them were clearly
        or presumably fictional.

        In <link xlink:href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Nagus">the article about the Grand Nagus in Star Trek DS9</link>

        business mind in the entire Ferengi Alliance, always thinking ten,
        sometimes twenty steps ahead of everyone else.» and this is similar for a hacker
        monarch who is often ahead of the curve.

simultaneous hacker monarchs, and that people can try to become ones while not

<para>
Note that even a hacker monarch may be fallible. Socrates almost got himself
killed several times until he willingly drank the poison. Plato and Aristotle
said equally blasphemous things, but learned from Socrates' fate and worked on
a better delivery so both died as highly reverred and respected. The same story
repeated itself with Galileo and Isaac Newton.

    Now here is something interesting: there is a strong correlation between

    Some people may still think that sexual attractiveness is indicative of
    incompetence and bad form, but it is the opposite. Back when
    I referred a deaf friend of mine to the video <link xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21uXcvD5lPs">Daily
    Gradvice</link> (tongue-in-cheek sex/love/etc. advice by <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Helbig">Grace Helbig</link>)
    he complained that the quality of the subtitles there was like "her butt
    before she cleans it up". I took offence for that because I knew
    she was a wonderful lady and that was because she was so sexy and
    sexualised, not despite that.
    </para>

<footnote>
    <para>
    The end of the story is that I told my friend that I will try to prepare
    better subtitles for use by him and others. While his original
    insulting delayed that, I eventually yielded <link

    <para>
    We were <link

    Apple's <link
    xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift
    language</link> the other day on the <link

    when I told someone there that he should charge 300 USD/hour for Swift
    projects because he disliked them so much. I also said the high fee may
    yield <link
    xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=joel-camels-rubber-duckies-11">a
    higher demand</link>.  Then I had a browser window open with the top
    Twitter accounts and <link
    xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift">Taylor Swift</link>
    was there and I noted she likely charges more than 300 USD/hour for her
    live shows. He told me that she shared her name with that language, and I
    noted that she should sue Apple for trademark violations of the supposed
    "Swift" trademark - and win.  I joked that if "Apple sued Taylor Swift for
    violation of their Apple Swift language's trademark they will spend all
    their money in the bank on litigation and still lose.". Ha ha only serious.
    </para>
    <para>
    I then realised that Ms. Swift has become a <link

    think her face is good eye candy, she is not that beautiful in my opinion
    (but I think she looks <link

    black hair</link> than with her trademark blonde hair). Nevertheless, there
    are many things we can learn from her.
        </para>

        <para>
        First of all is that she exemplifies the <link
        xlink:href="#amateurs">amateur model</link>, because she does stuff for
        fun, rather than for money.
        </para>

        <para>
        Her videos despite often being popular probably do not offset their
        production value in ads, but they are good publicity, provide fodder
        for remixes, parodies and covers, and are fun enough to produce so she
        can afford to offset the cost. She doesn't work for money or even for a
        shitload of money. She works for fun.
        </para>
        <para>
        Moreover, Taylor is an unapologetic <link
        xlink:href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attention_whore">"attention
        whore"</link> who often spends large amounts of money or even also time
        in activities that will make her look like a better person	or more
        well known.
        </para>
    <para>
    Otherwise, Taylor Swift is a great philanthropist who likely <link

    My <link
    xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#chuck_norris">previous
    analysis of Chuck Norris and the Chuck Norris factoids</link> turned out to
    not be the last word on the subject. It is well known than Norris took the
    facts to his advantage, and as a result became the most prominent actor in
    Hollywood (which I call "the Alpha Male"). However, shortly afterward, the
    factoids seem to have fallen out of favour, and shortly after that, Norris
    announced that he retired from acting.
    </para>

    <para>
    Now, I still added factoids about <link
    xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/">other things to
    my collection</link>. Then one day in 2019, I was chatting on the #gnu chat
    room on <link xlink:href="https://freenode.net/">freenode</link> and after
    giving someone some advice came by with a new factoid which I uttered
    there: <quote>If Chuck Norris gives you some advice, and you do not follow
    it, he'll survive. However, you likely won't.</quote>, and to my surprise
    my fellow to the conversation, told me it was funny.  Some days later I
    spent some time with my sister's husband, who is an artist and a film
    maker, and showed him some of the software applications and web services as
    well my own software or text works, which I was familiar with as a <link
    xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux (or rather
    "GNU/Linux")</link> user and developer. Just when he and my sister were
    going away, I told him I had some factoids on my site about Chuck
    Norris/etc., and he told me he was a big fan of those.
    </para>

    <para>
    So what has happened?
    </para>

    <para>
    What I think happened is that Norris started playing (and fighting) in
    roles he liked, even if he didn't get paid or got paid relatively little,
    or was paid after the fact.  He became a happy <link
    xlink:href="#amateurs">amateur</link> rather than an increasingly unhappy
    professional. I won't be surprised if he has agreed to appear at local
    schools' plays, and/or playing roles that were seemingly unlike his
    traditional Hollywood roles just because he liked them.
    </para>

    <para>
    As a result of that, I believe Chuck Norris, both himself and
    the fictionalised Chuck Norris Facts image, has become a
    new Hacker Monarch. Well Done!

It is also a good idea to compliment your friends and acquaintances, of

that in several years. (Which made me sad.)

One important thing to note is that we all have our limitations and we
are not good at everything. As a result, it is important that we sometimes
ask other people for help, despite whatever <link

on “independence” there
may be. For example, I prefer not to cook complex meals myself, because cooking

        <para>
        "Be excellent to each other" and being honest has implications with
        respect to how a man or a woman should approach a member of the
        appropriate sex (or <link
        xlink:href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/M/MOTAS.html">MOTAS</link>).
        If you are interested in testing the waters for a long-term
        relationship, then a good strategy will be to simply say: <quote>Hi, I
        like you and think you are
        beautiful/handsome/cute/hot/sexy/gorgeous/etc. What do you say we go on
        a date?</quote> Either he or she will agree, or you have wasted much

    <para>
    <link xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</link> is a video
    sharing site which you've probably heard of. While there are many
    official videos by signed artists or by the film owners' copyrights,
    there is also a huge ecosystem of original "direct-to-YouTube" art
    created by the so called "YouTubers". They upload anything from bootleg
    videos of songs, to technical tutorials, to low cost covers (often just
        a man or a woman singing and playing a guitar, a piano or even an electric
        organ or A cappella), to parodies, to lyric videos, to live recordings
    of any musicians or comedians.
    </para>
    <para>
    Now, some people still look down on YouTubers thinking that covers can never
    be better than the original, but having been introduced to the world of
    YouTube covers, I can often prove them wrong:

    <para>
    One problem with YouTube is that many videos have been removed, or
    censored, or
    disappeared, or blocked in certain regions (often by automated
        filters). Some people like me try to use
    <link xlink:href="https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</link>
    or similar downloaders to download every video that we like from
    YouTube, and while some die hard copyright puritans have looked
    down on that, I still support that as a way to battle censorship.
    <footnote>
    <para>
    Someone told me in a chat, that he believed that Google (who owns
        YouTube) will do a DMCA takedown for GitHub to censor youtube-dl,
    but even if they were stupid enough to do that (which I doubt), it
    would not stop youtube-dl, whose open source public domain source
    code has thousands of git clones and forks.

    While I do not condone the <link

    brought it upon themselves by the aggressive and irrational content
    filtering and removal, that many YouTube creators and users have been
    witnessing.
    </para>

<para>
I believe that signed artists and creators (or the somewhat more professional
ones) should <emphasis role="bold">emulate YouTubers</emphasis> and start indie
channels where they post regular collaborations with other YouTubers: from the
better known to the obscure.

    Capitalism has been getting a bad reputation since Karl Marx published
    his book <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital">Das Kapital</link>
    or as Neo-Tech put it:
    </para>

    <blockquote>

<para>
The dictionary definition of capitalism is: An economic system characterized by
private ownership of capital goods and by investments that are determined by
private decision rather than by state control. Prices, production and
distribution of goods are determined by a free market.
</para>
…
<para>
But most writers and commentators put dishonest altruistic-platonistic
connotations on the meaning of capitalism: A system of exploitation of the weak
by the strong -- devoid of love and good will. A system in which unwanted goods
and services are pushed onto consumers through clever, deceptive advertising
for the sole purpose of profits and greed. Capitalism dominates most Western
governments. Capitalism, big business, and fascism are synonymous.
</para>

I am no longer a libertarian purist, but I still think Capitalism and
liberalism are the best economic system and political system respectively.
