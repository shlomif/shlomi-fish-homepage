There's a model for computer programs called Lambda Calculus which
proves that declaring closures and executing them is enough to perform
all the operations provided by a full-fledged programming language. Perl
supports Lambda-Calculus in a very straight-forward way, due to its
support of lexical scoping.

Teaching Lambda-Calculus is out of the scope of this lecture, as well as
pretty much off-topic. The interested reader is referred to the following
