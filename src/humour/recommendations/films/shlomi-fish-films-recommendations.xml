<p>
This is my favourite movie, and the favourite of a lot of others from
my generation. It has an excellent dialogue, with many power sentences. The
acting is excellent, and the film is very enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
The Princess Bride has the format of a classic fairy tale, but with a few
interesting and non-ordinary twists. It is funny, engaging and highly
recommended.

<p>
    Spaceballs is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Essentially a
    parody of Star Wars and other Science-Fiction films, this films features
    Druish Princesses, mercenaries who “don’t do it for money”, but rather
    for “a shitload of money”, and an old small alien guru who claims that you
    should “never underestimate the power of the Schwartz”.
</p>

<p>
    I’ve seen this movie several times, and have either enjoyed it, or found
    it disappointing alternately. But the first time is a blast.

<p>
A wonderful French bittersweet comedy that takes place in early-2000
France. Amélie is a young woman who was raised in solitude, and is
starting to familiarise herself with the outside world. She tries to do
good deeds to her loved ones, and avenge a man she hates.
</p>

<p>
Funny, exciting, and engaging - Amélie is a wonderful movie.

<p>
I saw this movie several times on television, and liked what I saw. An
Irishman decides to popularise his Bed and Breakfast hotel by pretending
it is a ghost castle and inviting several American guests to stay there.
But much to everyone’s surprise, real actual ghosts appear and start
haunting the living.
</p>

<p>
My favourite quote from the movie is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Oh my God, What have I done? Oh my God! What have I done? Oh my God! What
a woman!
</p>

                            The Naked Guns are among the funniest movies
                            I’ve ever seen. I’ve watched them many times
                            on T.V. (and watched the third one originally
                            in the cinema), and enjoy them almost every time
                            I watch them.

                            of his friends. The movies have a lot of jokes,

                            to absurd situations.

                        <p>
                            It tells the story of a lovable, but multi-phobic

                            already accumulated a lot of psychiatric
                            pseudo-knowledge. He follows his recent successful
                            psychiatrist on his vacation, and slowly drives
                            him mad. This setting enables many jokes, gags,
                            and positively great humour.

                            This is a sports comedy about an award-winning
                            San-Diego-based cheerleading squad that discovers
                            that its departing Captain stole their moves from
                            a different squad from a run-down part of Los
                            Angeles. As the Toros struggle to get their
                            act together, there’s a lot of fun to be seen.

                            It’s hard for me to know what I exactly like
                            about this movie, but there are probably many
                            things to like. Kirsten Dunst acts great as
                            usual and I always adore her facial expressions.
                            Eliza Dushku and Gabrielle Union are also good.
                            It’s a fun movie, which I enjoyed watching several
                            times, and it’s still fun.

                        <p>
                            This series of movies takes on the decades-old
                            fascination of science-fiction writers with
                            time travel, and combines it with a lot of zany
                            humour, high-paced action, a great plot, wonderful
                            acting, and a superb setting.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly, a hip kid
                            who is friends with Dr. Emmett Brown (the excellent
                            Christopher Lloyd), a Mad Scientist who invents
                            a time machine that causes a mess-up in Marty’s
                            past, future, and present, and a wacky
                            attempt to restore it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The two first parts of the trilogy are really
                            fun, with the second being more wacky and
                            high-paced. The third part is not as good,
                            but still worth the watch, if only for closure.

                            his imprisonment during the third crusade, and

                            from the ruthless rule of the evil King John,

                            between Robin Hood, and Little John, for crossing
                            a small stream, a Robin Hood, that unlike some
                            Robin Hoods can speak in an English accent,
                            and an attempt to romance Lady Marianne of Bagel.

This is a relatively obscure, but positively beautiful and touching science
fiction film. A human pilot ends up stranded on a strange planet, beside a
reptilian humanoid-like alien, who belongs to a race, which the humans are at
war with. While initially being enemies, they learn to cooperate with each
other, speak each other’s language, and eventually even love and care for
each other.

<p>
There are some twists to the plot after that, and the movie kept me captivated.
Unfortunately, the movie budget’s had gone out of proportion, in part due
to a change of director, and it was not successful commercially. But watching
it on the Television proved to be an engaging experience for me when I was
younger.

<p>
An adaptation to film of the first part of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neverending_Story">the
Novel <i>The Neverending Story</i> by Michael Ende</a> (which I’ve read later
and can also recommend). The film is aesthetically pleasing, with wonderful
special effects, exotic fantastical creatures, great acting, and wonderful
and atmospheric music.
</p>

<p>
This is one of the finest fantasy movies I’ve ever seen, and I highly
recommend it.

                            A fantasy film based on a story by George
                            Lucas. An evil queen-sorceress is told that
                            a newborn baby-girl will end up killing her, and
                            orders her to be killed. The girl’s mother
                            puts her cradle on the river, where it ends
                            up being found by Willow, a member of a
                            village of a Hobbit-like race of men.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to save the village, Willow must travel
                            along with the baby, and find the destiny of
                            the baby, himself, and Madmartigen

                            This is my favourite of the new crop of Disney
                            animated films. Inspired by African legends,
                            the Lion King tells the story of a lion cub,
                            who learns about the place of his kind in Nature.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A few people told me that they heard people
                            claim this movie was <a
                                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism">pro-Fascist</a>,
                            but there are some obvious anti-Fascist elements
                            in it, and I didn’t find it so.
                        </p>

                            This film has great visual side, very nice
                            songs and music, great dialogues, a lot of
                            funny bits, and an engaging plot. Highly
                            recommended.

                            picture. An emperor of a pseudo-South American
