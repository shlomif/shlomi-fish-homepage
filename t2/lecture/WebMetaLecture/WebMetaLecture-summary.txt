Introduction:
    WebMetaLanguage - a tool for generating static HTML files out of templates.

    Orignally written by Ralf S. Engelschall and now maintained by
    Denis Barbier

The WML Methodology:
    - WML processes the input files through 9 passes:
    1. Include Preprocessor (similar to the C preprocessor)
    2. Macro Preprocessor for HTML documents (custom tags, simple
        conditionals, etc.)
    3. Embedded Perl 5 Language
    4. A GNU m4 pass.
    5. Diversion - places text in different places.
    6. Area Substitution - substitutes patterns within areas with something
    else (a la Perl 5 s/// and tr///)
    7. HTML Fixing.
    8. Stripping Redundant HTML code.
    9. Slicing - Outputs different code with different options.

Example 1: A Common Look and Feel <common_look>
----------------------------------

1. Prepare a template file: template.wml

<<< Insert code >>>

2. Prepare three pages : index.html.wml, download.html.wml, and links.html.wml

3. Prepare a Makefile:

<<< Insert code >>>

Render!

Voila! A fully functional site.

    Explanation:
    ------------

    #include 'myfile.wml' - includes a files from the current directory.

    {#NAME#} - puts the text defined by NAME in its place.

    $(ROOT) is a preprocessor variable that is defined in the makefile
    and is expanded whenever it appears. (Note: it will stick to the current
    directory regardless of the directory of the filename, by virtue of
    being defined with ~ instead of =)

    {#NAME#:TEXT:##} assigns TEXT to the diversion NAME

    <define-tag> defines a custom tag. %0 is its first parameter. (%1 is the
    second, etc.)


Example 2: Bolding the existing page
-------------------------------------

Let's cancel the link and bold their text when we are present in the page
linked to:

<<< Show the modified template >>>

    Explanation:
    ------------

    <ifneq ...> compares its first two arguments - if they are not equal,
    it expands to its third argumnent, else it expands to its fourth. There's
    also <ifeq ... >

Example 3: Creating a Meta-Tag
------------------------------

The previous example contained a lot of duplicate functionality. Let's
abstract it in a meta-tag.

    Explanation:

    <if ... /> is a conditional

    %0 and %1 are the arguments to the tag.

Example 4: Frames-Enabled and Non-Frames Version of the Same Site:
------------------------------------------------------------------

[SLICE: Put text here :] denotes a slice, that takes effect only if the
slice SLICE was defined. In this example we use it to generate a frames
and non-frames enabled version of the same site.

<<< Show code >>>

Example 5: A FAQ List with a Table of Contents
----------------------------------------------

We have learned enough about creating a site layout. Now let's do something
different for a change: create a list of frequently asked questions, with
a separate page that contains a brief table of contents.

To do so we'll create a meta-tag:

<question "Anchor" "My Title">

Body of answer

</question>

This tag will expand to the title with the body if a global variable is set
to a non-empty string, and to the hyperlinked title if it is empty.

We'll also create two meta tags <promote /> and <demote /> which will enable
creating sections and sub-sections.

For the sake of keeping our sanity - we will program some of the tags
in Perl.
