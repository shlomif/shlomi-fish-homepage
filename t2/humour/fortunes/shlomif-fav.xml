                    <p> Personally, I'd have a far better time writing scripts
                        if I had some more creative shells to script in…</p>

                    <p> ASMsh: The Assembly shell. Commands include MOV, SHL,
                        SHR, JNE, etc.  </p>

                    <p> shellTM: Turing machine shell. Only four commands.
                        Read, write, move left, move right. Capable of
                        producing any programming language imaginable, given
                        enough time and nerves of steel.  </p>

                    <p> GeneSH: Four commands. G, A, T, C. Need I say more?
                    </p>

                    <p> Qsh: Only uses one environment variable, which contains
                        all possible values simultaneously. Method of
                        scripting: isolate the universe in which the desired
                        result is already accomplished, and intersect with it.
                    </p>

                    <p> Of course, I never said they'd be easy to use. But
                        then, if these shells existed, and I knew a sysadmin
                        who used any of them, you can believe Sysadmin Day
                        would be a far more celebrated holiday.  </p>

                        In fact, I think Linus's [= Linus Torvalds'] cleverest and most consequential
                        hack was not the construction of the Linux kernel itself, but rather his
                        invention of the Linux development model.  When I expressed this
                        opinion in his presence once, he smiled and quietly repeated something
                        he has often said: "I'm basically a very lazy person who likes to get
                        credit for things other people actually do."  Lazy like a fox.  Or,
                        as Robert Heinlein famously wrote of one of his characters, too lazy
                        to fail.

                        The dictionary definition of capitalism is: An economic system characterized
                        by private ownership of capital goods and by investments that are determined
                        by private decision rather than by state control. Prices, production and
                        distribution of goods are determined by a free market.
                    </p>

                        …
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But most writers and commentators put dishonest altruistic-platonistic
                        connotations on the meaning of capitalism: A system of exploitation of the
                        weak by the strong -- devoid of love and good will. A system in which
                        unwanted goods and services are pushed onto consumers through clever,
                        deceptive advertising for the sole purpose of profits and greed. Capitalism
                        dominates most Western governments. Capitalism, big business, and fascism
                        are synonymous.

                        Yet, acting on fully integrated honesty (Neo-Tech), not reason itself, is
                        the basic moral act. When Genghis Khan, for example, chose to use reasoning
                        for a specific military move, then in an out-of-context sense, he chose to
                        act morally by protecting himself and his troops (thus filling human
                        biological needs). But in the larger sense of fully integrated honesty,
                        Khan's total actions were grossly immoral in choosing to use aggressive
                        force in becoming a mass murderer (thus negating human biological needs).
                        The highly destructive, irrational immorality of Genghis Khan's overall
                        dictatorial military actions far outweighed any narrow, out-of-context
                        "moral" actions. …Genghis Khan was enormously evil as were Stalin, Hitler,
                        Mao, Castro, Pol Pot.

                    <p>
                        Why are there so many unmaintainable applications written in PHP and Perl?
                        Because PHP and Perl let undisciplined, inexperienced programmers write
                        useful code. So does Ruby -- but give it the popularity and longevity of PHP
                        and Perl (at least in English-speaking circles) and I bet you'll see plenty
                        of bad code written in Ruby too.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This seems like a variant of the Hackers and Painters fallacy. (Paul Graham
                        is rich. Paul Graham writes Lisp. Therefore everyone who writes Lisp will
                        get rich.) "All of the good, smart programmers I know are using Ruby. They
                        write good code. Therefore you can't write bad code in Ruby!"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It feels like there's another fallacy in there somewhere. I want to call it
                        the Pre-Post-Java Blindspot, where Java was the beginning of Serious
                        Programming Languages and only its successor will unseat it. (Like any good
                        fallacy, you have to ignore history, such as the fact that Ruby's between 10
                        and 12 years old.)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        (I mean, if you really just can't read regular expressions, why not admit
                        it? You could start a twelve-step program or something.)

                        Much of the relative simplicity of Java is - like for most new languages -
                        partly an illusion and partly a function of its incompleteness. As time
                        passes, Java will grow significantly in size and complexity. It will double
                        or triple in size and grow implementation-dependent extensions or libraries.
                        That is the way every commercially successful language has developed. Just
                        look at any language you consider successful on a large scale. I know of no
                        exceptions, and there are good reasons for this phenomenon. [I wrote this

                        In yesterday's post (Bitten by the Enterprise Bug), we learned how vital
                        enterprise application are for proactive organizations leveraging collective
                        synergy to think outside the box and formulate their key objectives into a
                        win-win game plan with a quality-driven approach that focuses on empowering key
                        players to drive-up their core competencies and increase expectations with an
                        all-around initiative to drive up the bottom-line.

                    <p>
                        At least it does allow you to shoot yourself in the foot.

                    <p>
                        It doesn't say "shooting feet isn't supported"

                    <p>
                        Or you can shoot yourself in the foot by writing a management console plugin
                        that will pass the data to Word using VBA and then call Excel via com to split
                        it into columns and then write an activeX control to get the columns back as

                        You should learn several new words everyday--eventually you will forget how to
                        speak so others can understand you.

                        For thousands of years, we have been plagued by mathematicians insisting that
                        two plus two equals four. Who elected them? I, Stevie-O, am promoting an
                        entirely new system, where two plus two equals FIVE. Eventually, it will be
                        extended to provide other stuff these power-hungry madmen kept hidden away for
                        themselves, such as division by zero, cold fusion, the ability to solve the
                        halting problem, and the secret to attracting hot chicks.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Absolutely not.  Perl supports defunct operating systems, buggy
                        operating systems, commercial operating systems, and poorly marketed
                        operating systems.  It would be inappropropriate to drop SCO just
                        because it happens to be all of the above.

                        Recently, Richard Stallman gave a speech in which he illustrated an academic
                        point about programming history by quoting a guy who described vi as 'an editor
                        spread at sword-point and which is really hard to use'.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I think I speak for all moderate vi(m) users when I say -- DEATH and DAMNATION
                        (in that order) to this Cardinal of the CTRL key! Needless to say my own local
                        vim user group has dispatched assassins to kill Mr. Stallman, but this is
                        hardly the end of the story. The fact is that a man has referred to another man
                        who in turn expressed some often-voiced reservations about OUR EDITOR! On
                        behalf of all editors of text everywhere, I implore EMACS users to return to
                        the true path, lest you be burned at the stake and then go to hell, the Buffer
                        From Which There Is No Unloading. We'll see how productive you are then, with
                        your ctrl-meta-alt and your ELISP and your 'ring buffer', whatever THAT is.

                        The thing is, I don't actually enjoy debugging my own machines. I _much_
                        prefer having other people debug _their_ machines, and fixing my machine
                        in the process. So I didn't want just something that worked on the Mac
                        Mini, I wanted something that works _universally_, so that hopefully
                        people who are even crazier than me will waste _their_ time trying to get
                        these machines working.

                    <p>
                        First, they came for the newspapers, and I did nothing because the Farsi Side
                        comic was just re-prints now.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next, they came for the books, and I looked the other way because the Death to
                        America Book of the Month Club was only recommending books to burn anyway.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then, they came for the Satellite Dishes, and I said nothing because I still
                        had a year left on my Infidelphia Cable contract.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, they came for my Internet Service, and no one was left
                        to hear my ululation!

                    <p>
                        I'm at the ABs, and I still can't get a grip on the plot. Characters enter, are
                        introduced in exhausting detail -- and then disappear again! Very frustrating.
                        The only time an old character shows up again is in another's history! A lot
                        like _A Dance to the Music of Time_, I suppose.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Perhaps things will become clearer when we meet Oxford, English or Dictionary
                        -- clearly three key figures. Some kind of menage a trois?

                        Although the contents of her book, The Virtue of Selfishness, are precisely
                        accurate and widely integrated, Ayn Rand committed an error by distorting the
                        word "selfishness" in fashioning a dramatic statement. The word "selfishness"
                        does have valuable, precise denotations of "an irrational, harmful disregard
                        for others". Rand could have strengthened her work by selecting accurate
                        wording such as rational self-growth. Instead, she unnecessarily bent and
                        undermined the precise, valuable meaning of selfishness. …As with
                        selflessness, selfishness is a form of immature, destructive, irrational
                        behavior -- a form of stupid behavior.

                    <p>
                        Did you watch Uri Geller's show last night? He said that if anything
                        extraordinary happened at home during the show, people should phone in, or
                        report it at his website. During the entire show I was installing Hebrew
                        Windows XP for my mother-in-law, and something extraordinary did happen. The
                        operating system got installed, came up, ran without a glitch. Should I report
                        this to Uri?
                    </p>

                    <p>khatul's comment:</p>

                    <p>
                        Without a glitch, huh? Apparently you (and Uri) managed to install Linux from a
                        Windows XP installation CD. This is much more than telekinesis. It smells like
                        pure alien intervention. Report immediately!

                        It's one of those rare "perfect" kernels. So if it doesn't
                        happen to compile with your config (or it does compile, but then does
                        unspeakable acts of perversion with your pet dachshund), you can rest easy
                        knowing that it's all your own d*mn fault, and you should just fix your
                        evil ways.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You could send me and the kernel mailing list a note about it anyway, of
                        course. (And perhaps pictures, if your dachshund is involved. Not that
                        we'd be interested, of course. No. Just so that we'd know to avoid it next
                        time).

                        version 2.6.20.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Before downloading the actual new kernel, most avid kernel hackers have
                        been involved in a 2-hour pre-kernel-compilation count-down, with some
                        even spending the preceding week doing typing exercises and reciting PI
                        to a thousand decimal places.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The half-time entertainment is provided by randomly inserted trivial
                        syntax errors that nerds are expected to fix at home before completing
                        the compile, but most people actually seem to mostly enjoy watching the
                        compile warnings, sponsored by Anheuser-Busch, scroll past.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As ICD head analyst Walter Dickweed put it: "Releasing a new kernel on
                        Superbowl Sunday means that the important 'pasty white nerd'
                        constituency finally has something to do while the rest of the country
                        sits comatose in front of their 65" plasma screens".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Walter was immediately attacked for his racist and insensitive remarks
                        by Geeks without Borders representative Marilyn vos Savant, who pointed
                        out that not all of their members are either pasty nor white.  "Some of
                        them even shower!" she added, claiming that the constant stereotyping
                        hurts nerds' standing in society.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Geeks outside the US were just confused about the whole issue, and were
                        heard wondering what the big hoopla was all about. Some of the more
                        culturally aware of them were heard snickering about balls that weren't
                        even round.
                    </p>

                        A nice flame war. I'm just going to sit back, crack a beer and enjoy it.
                        It is almost memorial day weekend, you know. Hopefully it get hot enough
                        in here to roast a hot dog.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Oh goody! I'll help get things going:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            * MySQL users will have to wait until you are done with the fire before they
                            can roast their hot dogs, since MySQL is not a real database and does not
                            support concurrent roasting;
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            * I've read the PostgreSQL manual eight times and still can't figure out
                            something as bloody simple as roasting a hot dog, though I did figure out I
                            have to call VACUUM before I can apply ketchup;
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            * Serious enterprises who care about their hot dogs use Oracle, since you can
                            roast over 10,000 dogs at once and optionally impart the taste of filet mignon;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            * If you try to roast a footlong hotdog using MySQL it will silently truncate
                            it to regular size, causing your child to cry;
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            * Oracle will sue you if you complain about the difficulty of
                            starting your fire or the blackened taste of the dogs;
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            * With SQLite your hot dogs are pre-roasted;
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            * Last year on Memorial Day, mysqld leapt out of my MacBook Pro and pushed my
                            cousin into the fire, resulting in third degree burns. And also it causes
                            cancer. And terrorism. Blindness. Violent puppy death. BOO! MYSQL IS SCARY
                            DON'T USE MYSQL!!

                    <p>
                        Poetical sing-song or hypnotically rhythmic meter are often found in the
                        rhetoric of dictators, evangelists, sibyls, politicians, theologians,
                        mountebanks, social "intellectuals", media men, medicine men, hallucinating
                        psychotics, chanting shiites, and screaming terrorists. Consider how millions
                        of normally rational Germans thrilled and responded to the poetical cadence and
                        charisma of the consummate altruist neocheater, Adolph Hitler. The results: a
                        reign of destruction with tens of millions of human beings slaughtered so one
                        impotent man could indulge his mysticism to feel unearned power. All that
                        slaughter was for nothing more than to let one neocheater feel a pseudo
                        self-esteem. …Twenty million dead so one pip-squeak could feel big and
                        important.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "So what!" cry the mystics as the lifetime efforts of a thousand productive,
                        innocent individuals are blown to bits every day without a backward glance. So
                        what if the troops roll across the country with military cadence and guns
                        ablaze. So what if they level town after town, reducing to rubble and corpses
                        all the values, beauty, and life that took generations of productive effort to
                        build.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And that is all the chanting religious automatons or splendid Panzer divisions
                        know how to do -- to destroy in a moment, without a thought, all the values
                        that producers labored for lifetimes to build. Chanting mobs or marching troops
                        never glance back, never think for a moment of the death and destruction they
                        leave behind. So what! the mystics and neocheaters cry. So what if genocide
                        happens in Russia, Nazi Germany, Cuba, Cambodia, Red China, or in our land. "I
                        don't want to hear it! To hell with the lifetime efforts of productive
                        individuals! …Save the snail darter!"
                    </p>

Somebody who is presenting to shareholders knows how to change the

                        <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/What-would-Jesus-do/2005/05/25/1116950760739.html">http://xrl.us/7j6w</a>

                        "They felt Jesus would not have approved of copyright breaches."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Jesus, you da man! Stick it to those kids!
                    </p>

                    <p> You might be interested to note that the students had
                        studied "Exodus 20:15 - you shall not steal" which
                        comes a little way before Jesus anyway. Wasn't the
                        whole point of Jesus coming to make the "new
                        commandment" that people "love one another as I have
                        loved you" and to annul the previous commandments that
                        were given to Moses? I was raised Christian and was
                        Christian for a long time but now am not, but I can't
                        quite remember the specifics of this point.  </p>

                    <p> Anyway, the point is that Jesus probably would have
                        told them to stick Exodus to the man and just get on
                        with the lovin'. Or something.  </p>

                            the complexity and bad design in C++, and throw away
                            the speed and efficiency by compiling it to .NET
                            interpreted pseudocode instead. Microsoft has such

                        <p> What’s there not to like with C++/CLI? You
                            can have macros expanding to templates from which
                            generics are generated, and then have classes
                            generated from the generics. And these classes can
                            have a close function and two destructors, and hold
                            references to unmanaged pointers to managed
                            pointers!  With C++, you only have duplicate
                            features, but with C++/CLI, you can finally have
                            triplicate ones! You see, this is a language for an
                            expert. Experts love having 3 different ways to do
                            things, each broken in its own way.  </p>

                    <p>I think you'll find that the [Windows] Desktop Search is
                        completely inseparable from the desktop and that the
                        latter would be rendered completely useless if it is
                        uninstalled. Just like IE is.</p>

                    <p> Apart from the fact that I congratulate you for writing
                        bugless software without peer review, I also
                        congratulate you for being able to write a fully RFC
                        compliant MLM that won't blow up when you receive input
                        you didn't account for.  </p>

                    <p> Quite frankly, even a crappy sysadmin can get a
                        reasonable mailman setup working (including nice
                        archiving), quicker than the best coder can rewrite a
                        full MLM from scratch.  And you still have time left
                        over to modify/fix/improve mailman to do the few things
                        it didn't do quite right for you.  </p>

                    <p> But if your attitude to coding is "I'd rather rewrite
                        all this than soiling my eyes and hands looking at
                        someone else's code", that's not a very good way to get
                        hired anywhere as a coder, and even if you are super
                        brilliant, you end up being a DJB that people snicker
                        at with "that guy thinks he's so bright that he had to
                        write his own libc" (instead of fixing/wrapping the few
                        problematic pieces of them, and in the case of
                        reasonable maintainers, contributing the code back).

                    <p> Among the generalists, the conventional wisdom is that
                        the worse-is-better approach is more adaptive.
                        Personally, I get a little tired of the argument: My
                        worse-is-better is better than your worse-is-better
                        because I'm better at being worser! Is it really true
                        that the worse-is-better approach always wins? With
                        Perl 6 we're trying to sneak one better-is-better cycle
                        in there and hope to come out ahead before reverting to
                        the tried and true worse-is-better approach.  Whether
                        that works, only time will tell.  </p>

                        The regression list keeps shrinking, so we're still on track for a full
                        2.6.24 release in early January. Assuming we don't all overeat during the
                        holidays and nobody gets any work done. But we all know that the holidays
                        are really the time when we get away from the boring "real work", and can
                        spend 24/7 on kernel hacking instead, right?

                        I have discovered that there are two types of command interfaces in the world
                        of computing: good interfaces and user interfaces.

                    <p>
                        Xeno's paradox is easily disproved in three steps:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Get crossbow and bolt.</li>
                        <li>Aim crossbow at Xeno.</li>
                        <li>Fire.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        If the bolt moves to Xeno, then it is proved that movement is possible. Also,
                        Xeno will be dead. Win win situation.

                        I thought I had done some rather horrible things with gcc built-ins and

                        As my daughter would say: that patch fell out of the ugly tree, and hit
                        every branch on the way down. Very impressive.

                        Are you saying that this linux can run on a computer without windows underneath
                        it, at all ? As in, without a boot disk, without any drivers, and without any
                        services ?
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        That sounds preposterous to me.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If it were true (and I doubt it), then companies would be selling computers
                        without a windows. This clearly is not happening, so there must be some error
                        in your calculations. I hope you realise that windows is more than just Office
                        ? Its a whole system that runs the computer from start to finish, and that is a
                        very difficult thing to acheive. A lot of people dont realise this.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Microsoft just spent $9 billion and many years to create Vista, so it does not
                        sound reasonable that some new alternative could just snap into existence
                        overnight like that. It would take billions of dollars and a massive effort to
                        achieve. IBM tried, and spent a huge amount of money developing OS/2 but could
                        never keep up with Windows. Apple tried to create their own system for years,
                        but finally gave up recently and moved to Intel and Microsoft.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Its just not possible that a freeware like the Linux could be extended to the
                        point where it runs the entire computer fron start to finish, without using
                        some of the more critical parts of windows. Not possible.
                    </p>

                        I think you need to re-examine your assumptions.

                        Linux Genuine Advantage™ is an exciting and mandatory new way for you to place
                        your computer under the remote control of an untrusted third party!
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        According to an independent study conducted by some scientists, many users of
                        Linux are running non-Genuine versions of their operating system. This puts
                        them at the disadvantage of having their computers work normally, without
                        periodically phoning home unannounced to see if it's OK for their computer to
                        continue functioning. These users are also missing out on the Advantage of
                        paying ongoing licensing fees to ensure their computer keeps operating
                        properly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To remedy this, we have created a new program available as a required free
                        download: Linux Genuine Advantage™!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally! Linux users can experience a feature that until now remained the
                        exclusive domain of proprietary software.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once you've installed Linux Genuine Advantage™, you'll want to register and
                        send in your licensing fees to receive these important benefits:
                    </p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>
                            Your computer, which worked just fine before, will continue functioning
                            normally!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Our software which you just installed will not disable logins on your
                            computer (as long as our license server keeps working properly)!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It's totally awesome!  We might not raise the yearly licensing fees in the
                            future!
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Plus, if you act now, we promise not to launch unfounded lawsuits against you,
                        slander you or our competitors in the press and the courts (possibly by using
                        other smaller companies as pawns), or require you to pay us for software you
                        won't use on every new computer you buy!

                        08/25/2007 - The Windows Genuine Advantage servers went down worldwide, marking
                        any Windows machines as pirated during Microsoft's server outage. Meanwhile,
                        the Linux Genuine Advantage™ activation server was up the whole time. Truly
                        another victory for Open Source software! Microsoft, contact us if you'd like
                        to license Linux Genuine Advantage™, we'd love to enter into a lucrative
                        licensing agreement. With the money you save, you could put the WGA programmers
                        onto other tasks, like improving Vista!

                        If you were a Unix programmer you either programmed in C or shell. And there
                        really wasn't much in between. There were these little languages that we used
                        on top of shell, but that was the big divide. The big revelation that hatched
                        Perl, as it were, was that this opened up into a two-dimensional space. And C
                        was good at something I like to call manipulexity, that is the manipulation of
                        complex things. While shell was good at something else which I call
                        whipuptitude, the aptitude for whipping things up.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So Perl was hatched. As a small egg. That was Perl 1. And it was designed from
                        the very beginning to evolve. The fact that we put sigils in front of the
                        variables meant that the namespaces were protected from new keywords. And that
                        was intentional, so we could evolve the language fairly rapidly without
                        impacting.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And it evolved… And it evolved… And finally we got to Perl 5. And… So…
                        Perhaps the Perl 6 slogan should be "All Your Paradigms Are Belong To Us".
                        We'll get to that.

                    <p>
                        So I'd like to start off with my own irrationalities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I don't think syntax should dangle in the wind. I'm with Aristotle. I think
                        things should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Which means I like K&amp;R
                        bracketing. I do not like the way that Python hangs stuff out there, with no
                        end.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I think that ordinary people dislike abstraction. That's because I dislike
                        abstraction and I think I'm ordinary. (laughter) I might be wrong about that,
                        but I don't know.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I simultaneously believe that languages are wonderful and awful. You have to
                        hold both of those. Ugly things can be beautiful. And beautiful can get ugly
                        very fast. You know, take Lisp. You know, it's the most beautiful language in
                        the world. At least up until Haskell came along. (laughter) But, you know,
                        every program in Lisp is just ugly. I don't figure how that works.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I think visual metaphors are very important. How it looks. Different things
                        should look different. Similar things should look similar. A language designer
                        simultaneously has to care what other people think, and has to not care what
                        other people think. Otherwise you go crazy. Well, crazier. (laughter)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And finally, I think God has free will. And therefore he created programmers
                        with free will and that they ought to be given choices.
                    </p>

                        Now, I'm not the only language designer with irrationalities. You can think of
                        some languages to go with some of these things.

                    <ul>
                        <li>"We've got to start over from scratch" - Well, that's almost any academic
                            language you find.</li>
                        <li>"English phrases" - Well that's Cobol. You know, cargo cult English.  (laughter)</li>

                        <li>"I thought of a way to do it so it must be right" - That's obviously PHP.  (laughter and applause)</li>
                        <li>"You can build anything with NAND gates" - Any language designed by an electrical engineer. (laughter)</li>
                        <li>"This is a very high level language, who cares about bits?" - The entire scope of fourth generation languages fell into this… problem.</li>
                        <li>"Users care about elegance" - A lot of languages from Europe tend to fall into this. You know, Eiffel.</li>
                        <li>"The specification is good enough" - Ada.</li>
                        <li>"Abstraction equals usability" - Scheme. Things like that.</li>
                        <li>"The common kernel should be as small as possible" - Forth.</li>
                        <li>"Let's make this easy for the computer" - Lisp. (laughter)</li>
                        <li>"Most programs are designed top-down" - Pascal. (laughter)</li>
                        <li>"Everything is a vector" - APL.</li>
                        <li>"Everything is an object" - Smalltalk and its children. (whispered:) Ruby. (laughter)</li>
                        <li>"Everything is a hypothesis" - Prolog. (laughter)</li>
                        <li>"Everything is a function" - Haskell. (laughter)</li>
                        <li>"Programmers should never have been given free will" - Obviously, Python.  (laughter)</li>

                    <p>
                        So my psychological conjecture is that normal people, if they perceive that a
                        computer language is forcing them to learn theory, they won't like it. In other
                        words, hide the fancy stuff. It can be there, just hide it.

                        Back to dimensionality. When you are saying something linguistically, it's like
                        taking a trip. You know, when you take a trip from California to Netanya, you
                        don't go straight south and then straight west and then straight north. It's
                        not orthogonal. There are little bits at the beginning. Then you take bigger
                        hops on the planes and then you take littler hops at the end. Language works
                        the same way, it's fractal. There is little orthogonality. At least apparently;
                        you can have orthogonal views of it, there are orthogonal subsets. But there
                        are multiple orthogonal subsets. At first glance it just looks like a network,
                        and you have to navigate the geography.

                    <p>Now in terms of the anthropology we try to welcome people into the tribe. We
                        allow people to have their own little fiefdoms, where they are the ruler and
                        can beat up on their followers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We try to let people share with each other. We try to capture knowledge. Both
                        of those things are why we have the CPAN, Comprehensive Perl Archive Network,
                        which is arguably one of the greatest repositories of reusable crappy software
                        in the world. (laughter).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And we have a culture of cooperating with other cultures too. We try to make
                        Parrot so that other languages can ran on top of that. We've always tried to
                        hook up Perl with everything. In kind of a humble sort of way. And finally it's
                        culture of fun. At least we try to make it that way. And that's why I give
                        weird talks.

                        So, everybody has a different idea. Everybody also has different hardware. The
                        desktop is also where all the hardware really exists. Servers have 1% of the
                        hardware that the desktop has in terms of different drivers and things like
                        that. You don’t find webcams on servers generally. You don’t find oddball IDE
                        drives on servers.

                    <p>When the first caveman programmer chiseled the first program on the walls of
                        the first cave computer, it was a program to paint the string `Hello, world' in
                        Antelope pictures. Roman programming textbooks began with the `Salut, Mundi'
                        program. I don't know what happens to people who break with this tradition, but
                        I think it's safer not to find out. We'll start with a series of hello world
                        programs that demonstrate the different aspects of the basics of writing a

                    <p>
                        The difference between a program and a script isn't as subtle as most people
                        think. A script is interpreted, and a program is compiled.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Of course, there's no reason you can't write a compiler that immediately
                        executes the compiled form of a program without writing compilation artifacts
                        to disk, but that's an implementation detail, and precision in technical
                        matters is important.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Though Perl 5, for example, doesn't write out the artifacts of compilation to
                        disk and Java and .Net do, Perl 5 is clearly an interpreter even though it
                        evaluates the compiled form of code in the same way that the JVM and the CLR
                        do. Why? Because it's a scripting language.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Okay, that's a facetious explanation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The difference between a program and a script is if there's native compilation
                        available in at least one widely-used implementation. Thus Java before the
                        prevalence of even the HotSpot JVM and its JIT was a scripting language and now
                        it's a programming language, except that you can write a C interpreter that
                        doesn't have a JIT and C programs become scripts.

                    <p>Of course, if someone were to write an extra optimizer step for Perl 5 to
                        evaluate certain parts of the optree and generate native code in memory on
                        certain platforms without writing it out to disk (uh oh…) and then execute
                        that code under certain conditions, all Perl 5 scripts would automatically turn
                        into programs.  You know, like .pmc files, or Python's .pyc files. Uh.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As well, if more people use Punie (Perl 1 on Parrot) this year than native Perl
                        1 -- a possibility -- then Perl 1 scripts automatically become Perl 1 programs
                        because Punie can use Parrot's JIT. I don't know if this powerful upgrade from
                        script to program is retroactive, but I see no reason why not.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Perl 5 scripts were briefly programs while Ponie was viable, but the removal of
                        the code from the Parrot tree has now downgraded them back to scripts. We
                        apologize for the inconvenience.

                    <p>To summarize, if you have a separate compilation step visible to developers,
                        you have programs. If not, you have scripts. An exception is that if you have a
                        separate, partial compilation step at runtime and not visible to users, then
                        you may have programs. The presence of one implementation that performs
                        additional compilationy thingies at runtime instantly upgrades all scripts to
                        programs, while the presence of an interpreter for a language in which people
                        normally write programs, not scripts, does not downgrade programs to scripts.
                        Program-ness is sticky.</p>

                    <p>
                        I hope this is now clear.

                        Ironically some JavaScript implementations have JITs, so the colloquial name of
                        the language should change from JavaScript to JavaProgram.

                        I have to say I cringed a little when I read it, because it helps
                        reinforce the idea that there's a sort of Perl Hierarchy, or that
                        there are Perl Gods, or that "you must be this tall to ride".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Randal and I are just normal ol' Perl hackers.  We just spend a lot of
                        time on Perl, and writing about it, and talking about it.  The only
                        reason we are Perl luminaries is that we are Perl luminaries.  I'm not
                        necessarily a better programmer, or have better ideas, or I'm a better
                        debugger than anyone else.  I just do it and make noise about it.
                    </p>

                        Even though Joey's response was out of line, I admire his spirit of
                        "I'm just going to go do it."  TMTOWTDI is one of the cardinal rules
                        of Perl.  Similarly, over on the module-authors list, the perennial
                        argument of "Maybe CPAN should have minimum requirements for posting
                        modules" has raised its ugly head.  Instead, I said what I always say
                        during these arguments: "CPAN thrives BECAUSE of the unfettered
                        uploading of shit, not in spite of it."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So to it will be with Joey's website.  Maybe it will be a dismal
                        failure.  Maybe it will become the Next Great Perl resource.  However,
                        I know that there is zero chance of Next Great Perl resource if he
                        doesn't try.  The only way you get home runs is by stepping up to the
                        plate, and if you strike out, you're doing pretty good.  Batting 3/10
                        is a great batting average, but in real life we find those odds
                        terrifying.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Personally, as much as I like the community around Perlmonks, I think
                        it's a terrible site for new people, and is practically unsearchable.
                        I'd love to see something leapfrog Perlmonks and become the Next Great
                        Thing.  That's why I stopped writing to use.perl.org, because I think
                        it's a terrible news source.  Instead, I started perlbuzz.com, and
                        went with that.  Yes, it's different, but that's OK.
                    </p>

                        Suppose you went back to Ada Lovelace and asked her the
                        difference between a script and a program. She'd probably
                        look at you funny, then say something like: Well, a script is
                        what you give the actors, but a program is what you give the
                        audience. That Ada was one sharp lady…

                    <p> Now, however it was initially intended, I think BASIC turned
                        out to be one of the first major scripting languages,
                        especially the extended version that DEC put onto its
                        minicomputers called BASIC/PLUS, which happily included
                        recursive functions with arguments. I started out as a BASIC
                        programmer. Some people would say that I'm permanently
                        damaged. Some people are undoubtedly right.  </p>

                    <p> But I'm not going to apologize for that. All language
                        designers have their occasional idiosyncrasies. I'm just
                        better at it than most. :-) </p>

                    <p> Anyway, when I was a RSTS programmer on a PDP-11, I certainly
                        treated BASIC as a scripting language, at least in terms of
                        rapid prototyping and process control. I'm sure it warped my
                        brain forever. Perl's statement modifiers are straight out of
                        BASIC/PLUS. It even had some cute sigils on the ends of its
                        variables to distinguish string and integer from floating
                        point.  </p>

                    <p> But you could do extreme programming. In fact, I had a
                        college buddy I did pair programming with. We took a compiler
                        writing class together and studied all that fancy stuff from
                        the dragon book. Then of course the professor announced we
                        would be implementing our own language, called PL/0. After
                        thinking about it a while, we announced that we were going to
                        do our project in BASIC. The professor looked at us like were
                        insane. Nobody else in the class was using BASIC. And you
                        know what? Nobody else in the class finished their compiler
                        either. We not only finished but added I/O extensions, and
                        called it PL 0.5. That's rapid prototyping.  </p>

                    <p> My first scripting language was written in BASIC. For my job
                        in the computer center I wrote a language that I called JAM,
                        short for Jury-rigged All-purpose Meta-language. Story of my
                        life…  </p>

                    <p> JAM was an inside-out text-processing language much like PHP,
                        except that HTML hadn't been invented yet. We mostly used it
                        as a fancy macro processor for BASIC. Unlike PHP, it did not
                        have 3,000 functions in one namespace. We wouldn't have had
                        the memory, for one thing.  </p>

                    <p> For good or ill, when I went off to grad school, I studied
                        linguistics, so the only computer language I used there was
                        LISP. It was my own personal McCarthy era.  </p>

                    <p> Is LISP a candidate for a scripting language? While you can
                        certainly write things rapidly in it, I cannot in good
                        conscience call LISP a scripting language. By policy, LISP
                        has never really catered to mere mortals.  </p>

                    <p> And, of course, mere mortals have never really forgiven LISP
                        for not catering to them.  </p>

                    <p>
                        That's not helpful.  When a project doesn't release a new version, some people
                        say "Oh, don't use it!  They don't release new versions!"  When a project
                        does release a new version, some people say "Oh, don't use it!  It's not
                        perfect yet!"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, the so-called reliable state of the art is a jumble of Perl which
                        writes cross platform shell scripts to install Perl code, and you customize
                        that by writing a superclass from which platform-specific modules inherit
                        pseudo-methods which use regular expressions to search and replace
                        cross-platform cross-shell code, with all of the cross-platform and
                        cross-shell quoting issues that entails.  I wish I were making any of this
                        up.  (I wrote tests for part of it.)
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        This is why we can't have nice things.

                    <p> I did all I could to stop it, but it just wasn't
                        possible.  pgTAP 0.20  has somehow made its way from my
                        Subversion server and infiltrated the  PostgreSQL
                        community. Can nothing be done to stop this menace? Its
                        use  leads to cleaner, more stable, and more-safely
                        refctored code. This  insanity must be stopped! Please
                        review the following list of its  added vileness since
                        0.19 to determine how you can stop the terrible,
                        terrible influence on your PostgreSQL unit-testing
                        practices that is  pgTAP: … </p>

                    <p> Don't make the same mistake I did, where I wrote a lot
                        of pgTAP tests  for a client, and now testing database
                        upgrades from 8.2 to 8.3 is  just too reliable! And by
                        all means, DO NOT read the documentation or  download
                        and install this monstrosity, since it could easily
                        lead to  cleaner, more stable code, and therefore
                        losing your job!  </p>

                    <p> I must dispute your view in the strongest terms
                        possible.  Internet Explorer is perfectly safe for
                        everyday use.  However, as there is no such thing as
                        perfect security, you must take additional precautions
                        to keep evil hackers away from your data. Apply these
                        rules according to the sensitivity of your data, from
                        least important to most: </p>

                    <ul>

                        <li> Disconnect your computer from your local network.
                            Download files on another computer, scan them for
                            viruses, print them out, scan them into your
                            Windows PC using ORC software, and then view the
                            pages in IE.  </li>

                        <li> Do the above, but have a priest onsite to bless
                            each page individually before scanning it. This is
                            an excellent deterrent against viruses with the
                            word "demon" in the name.  </li>

                        <li> Do the above, but encase your PC in acrylic and
                            immerse it in a 10,000 gallon tank of holy water.
                            Interact with it while wearing scuba gear.  </li>

                        <li> Do the above, but put a lid on the tank and
                            immerse it in the ocean. Interact with your PC via
                            a submersible robot in the tank from from outside
                            while wearing scuba gear.  </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If you fail to follow these simple security guidelines,
                        you can't blame Microsoft for the results.

                            in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony

                            structure, and marked a shift from a form of
                            Althusserian theory that takes structural
                            totalities as theoretical objects to one in which

                    <p> Jonathan Schwartz&#8217;s resignation via Twitter
                        reminded me of a strange facet of Sun company culture:
                        I&#8217;ve never known so many married couples working
                        for the same company. Some of them even worked on the
                        same project together.  For the same boss.  From
                        home.</p>

                    <p>Now, the exact percentage of married couples in a
                        company can&#8217;t be used to compare companies
                        directly &#8211; after all, it depends heavily on
                        things like industry, age, and local marriage laws
                        &#8211; but it seems linked to another facet of Sun
                        company culture: Complete, almost embarrassing
                        disconnect from public opinion.</p> <p>The post-Google
                        standard company perks &#8211; free food, on-site
                        exercise classes, company shuttles &#8211; make it
                        trivial to speak only to fellow employees in daily
                        life.  If you spend all day with your co-workers,
                        socialize only with your co-workers, and then come home
                        and eat dinner with &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; your
                        co-worker, you might go several years without hearing
                        the words, &#8220;<strong>Run Solaris on my desktop?
                            Are you f&#8212;ing kidding me?</strong>&#8220;</p>

                    <p>Schwartz&#8217;s &#8220;the financial crisis did
                        it&#8221; explanation for Sun&#8217;s demise is a
                        symptom of an inbred company culture in which employees
                        at all levels voluntarily isolated themselves from the
                        larger Silicon Valley culture.  Tech journalists write
                        incessantly about the exchange of expertise and best
                        practice between companies as a major driver of the Bay
                        area&#8217;s success.  But you have to actually talk to
                        your competition to do that &#8211; over a beer, or
                        maybe a pillow.</p>

                    <p> Or think about shell programming, and reductionism. How
                        many times have we heard the mantra that a program
                        should do one thing and do it well?  </p>

                    <p> Well…Perl does one thing, and does it well. What it
                        does well is to integrate all its features into one
                        language. More importantly, it does this without making
                        them all look like each other. Ducts shouldn't look
                        like girders, and girders shouldn't look like ducts.
                        Neither of those should look like water pipes, and it's
                        really important that water pipes not look like sewer
                        pipes. Or smell like sewer pipes. Modernism says that
                        we should make all these things look the same (and
                        preferably invisible). Postmodernism says it's okay for
                        them to stick out, and to look different, because a
                        duct ought to look like a duct, and a sewer pipe ought
                        to look like a sewer pipe, and hammer ought to look
                        like a hammer, and a telephone ought to look like
                        either a telephone, or a Star Trek communicator. Things
                        that are different should look different.  </p>

                    <p> Which is why I didn't belabor it, or introduce it out
                        of context. I was pointing out that Firefox's scheme is
                        only as secure as the master password you choose. The
                        particular bad password I chose for the Spaceballs
                        reference on the hope that it might get a chuckle or
                        trigger a brief moment of pleasant nostalgia,
                        forgetting that on /., every joke must be beaten to
                        death and explained, rehashed, insulted, re-explained
                        by someone who thinks the insult came due to
                        unfamiliarity, etc., until all traces of humor vanish.
                        Oh well… </p>

                    <p> Hmm… This is an old story, so this probably won't
                        receive any mods, but I have no idea what I'd mod it if
                        I were moderating.
                        Flamebait/Insightful/Funny/Interesting/Off-topic maybe?
                        Mods, if you can coordinate to apply each of those
                        once, it would be awesome (and I'd end up with overall
                        neutral Karma!). :-) </p>

                    <p> I keep hearing and reading this nice proverb <b>if it
                            ain't broke, don't fix it</b>. The latest apperance
                        was in response to <a
                            href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/37969.html">Shlomi
                            Fish</a> suggesting that some Ancient Perl code
                        should be replaced by Modern Perl code.  </p>

                    <p> I am not saying that every pices of code should be
                        rewritten every 6 months, but in my understanding that
                        sentence actually translates to <b>let's wait till it
                            breaks and then panic</b>.  </p>

                    <p> I think people who say that sentence are afraid that
                        the new version will break something. Sure, there is
                        always a chance that a change introduces an error, but,
                        if we are afraid to touch the code, what will happen
                        when later on we encounter a case where it does not
                        work? For example, if we need to use it in a new
                        environment. Will we have the courage to change the
                        code then? How much will it cost in money, time, and
                        lost sleep?  </p>

                    <p> I think we have been trying to teach ourselves that we
                        should have really good test coverage of our code and
                        then we can easily refactor it and get rid of technical
                        debt. So why do we keep hearing that sentence?  </p>

                    <p> Often, when I ask the people I train if they know Perl,
                        they tell me “I don't know Perl. I can only read it”.
                        I wonder whether it indicates that Perl is not a
                        write-only language as some people like to claim.  </p>

                    <p> Hopefully someone will patent reality TV shows. I am
                        rather sick of those.  </p>

                    <p> Wait no, this wont work. You need to have a story to be
                        able to patent it. Soon all that will be on the air is
                        reality TV.  Noooo!  </p>

                    <p>
                        In this doggy-dog world, does grammer; spelling; “or
                        correct” quotation usage really matter anymore? I
                        beleive not. Case and point: mitsakes is literally a
                        diamond dozen, but they TOTALLY don’t make me want to
                        claw my eyes out with a dull spoon. Irregardless, it
                        begs the question: is it a mute point? For all
                        intensive purposes, if bad enlgish would of been the
                        downfall of society, then we’d of seen it bye now. some
                        say teh worst problem is loosing capitalization
                        punctuation is also an issue i think some thoughts need
                        to be seperated or maybe its the run on sentences? Does
                        it try your patients when I’LOL OMG Y U BFF said IDK
                        BRB?!! OIC, the BBQ is W/E GF IKR!!  1 How bad does it
                        get before i.e. its something up with which you will
                        not put?

                    <p> A UDP packet walks into a bar, no one acknowledges him.
                    </p>

                    <p> A TCP packet walks into a bar twice because no one
                        acknowledged him the first time.  </p>

                    <p> An ICMP packet walks into a bar, says “Hello!” to the
                        bartender, who then in turn runs out to tell the ICMP
                        packet’s wife.

                    <p> A BGP peer walks into a bar, exchanges contact details
                        with every one, then leaves and… yeah I’ve probably
                        gone over my quota for terrible jokes today.  </p>

                    <p> You might be on
                        to something here! But the 140 char limit would really
                        stifle my creativity when it comes to comments. I'd
                        rather create facebook pages for every package - that
                        way we could add karma by “liking” a package.  </p>

                    <p> We could even take it a step farther and use this for
                        marketing. Just imagine - “Play farmville with glibc
                        next wednesday and learn about the great new

                        “NetworkManager wants to be your friend”. Oh the
                        possibilities …</p>

                    <p> Then again, the thought of getting an email saying
                        “Anaconda is now following you on Twitter” also amuses
                        me.  </p>

                    <p> Popular pet names Rover, Cheryl and Kate could be a
                        thing of the past. Banks are now advising parents to
                        think carefully before naming their child’s first pet.
                        For security reasons, the chosen name should have at
                        least eight characters, a capital letter and a digit.
                        It should not be the same as the name of any previous
                        pet, and must never be written down, especially on a
                        collar as that is the first place anyone would look.
                        Ideally, children should consider changing the name of
                        their pet every 12 weeks.  </p>

                    <p>

                        Expectant mothers have also been advised to choose
                        carefully where they give birth. Anywhere that has a
                        place name is best avoided. These are listed on maps,
                        which are freely available on the Internet.  </p>

                    <p> It’s a good idea too, security experts have warned, for
                        children not to get friendly with certain teachers. For
                        instance, Miss Smith may be enriching your son’s
                        education but he should try and see if he can’t make a
                        favourite of Father O’Grinnighan-Scythe II, even though
                        it may mean a lot of staying late.  </p>

                    <p> We tried to call Barclays’ security expert R0b Ste!nway
                        for a comment, but he was not available for 24 hours,
                        having answered his phone incorrectly three times in
                        succession.  </p>

                <title>Why Debian May Have an Older Version of a Package</title>
            </meta>
            <quote>
                <body>
                    <p> There are a ton of reasons why Debian may have an
                        older version of an upstream release. For example, and
                        I hasten to point out that the following list is by no
                        means exhaustive, and not all of the possibilities are
                        common: </p>

                    <ul>

                        <li> The Debian package maintainer is dead, but nobody
                            noticed it yet, and nobody has wanted an update
                            badly enough to do an NMU or to adopt the package.
                        </li>

                        <li> The upstream release is actually a fake. It's a
                            trojan, which was put there by the NSA in order to
                            infiltrate the CIA mainframe. The Debian package
                            maintainer noticed this and uploaded that version
                            of the package to non-free instead of main, since
                            the trojan code does not come with proper source.
                        </li>

                        <li> Upstream has moved the RSS feed for new releases
                            without notifying the old feed of the move, so the
                            Debian package maintainer missed that, and doesn't
                            actually know about the new release. Due to a
                            complicated series of happenstance involving
                            rainbows, midget unicorns, and the ongoing rewrite
                            of the Netsurf web browser, the Debian package
                            maintainer is not able to find the new feed because
                            it would require doing a web search and their
                            browser doesn't have working form support now. No
                            other browser is available on the Amiga they're
                            using as their only computer, either.  </li>

                        <li> The new release is requested by insistent Hurd
                            porters, and the Debian package maintainer
                            absolutely loathes the Hurd, and will refuse to
                            upload any packages that work on the Hurd.  </li>

                        <li> The Debian package maintainer suffers from mental
                            problems cause by reading debian-devel too much,
                            and now has a nervous breakdown every time they
                            recognize a name as someone whom they've seen on
                            the list.  </li>

                        <li> The Debian development process is being sabotaged
                            by Microsoft sending people to the developers'
                            houses pretending to be TV license checkers or
                            Jehova's witnesses every time they detect, using
                            the hardware wireless keylogger embedded in every
                            PC, that the developer is trying to run any Debian
                            packaging command.  </li>

                        <li> Apple is also sabotaging Debian by paying me to
                            write snarky e-mails on Debian mailing lists to
                            distract everyone from working on the actual
                            release, so that we can get past the freeze and
                            start uploading things again without having to
                            worry that it breaks things in ways that makes the
                            freeze longer.  </li>
