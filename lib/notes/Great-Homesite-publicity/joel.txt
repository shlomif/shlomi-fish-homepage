I wrote a new essay titled "Create a Great Personal Homesite":

http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/web/create-a-great-personal-homesite/

It includes:

1. Why should you have a personal home-site?

2. What are the elements of a good personal home-site?

3. How to build a personal homesite.

4. Critique of some popular homesites.

You are welcome to read it and comment. I'll also be happy if you'd like to volunteer to translate it to other languages. (But co-ordinate it with me first to encourage co-operative effort).
