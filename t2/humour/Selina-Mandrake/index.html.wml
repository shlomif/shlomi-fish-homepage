A supernatural dramedie, this screenplay has many ties to my other screenplay
<a href="$(ROOT)/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">Star Trek: “We, the
Living Dead”</a>, and was part of the grand Star Trek Deep Space Nine /
Buffy the Vampire Slayer / etc. great conspiracy theory thing that I imagined
in my “great mania” that has inspired me ever since. It’s very
far-fetched, but on the other hand conveys many serious messages and insights.

<p>
Hope you enjoy it!

Well, since this work is a parody of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer"><i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i></a> (written by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon">Joss
Whedon</a>), and contains characters from there,
I am theoretically protected by the Copyright’s
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use#Fair_use_and_parody">“right of
parody”</a> as part of the ”Fair Use” provision. There are other parodies of
Buffy’s works online and possibly offline, and no one was sued yet.
</p>

<p>
This work also uses other characters and concepts, from other copyrighted, and
already Public Domain works.
</p>

<p>
All the text in <i>Selina Mandrake - The Slayer</i> is original, and as far as
I’m concerned can be used under the terms of
<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">the Creative Commons

your option any later version</a>, but like I said, the situation is
more complicated than that.
</p>

<p>
I’m putting it here on this site in hope it will amuse or inspire
people, and also because it may encourage people to watch some episodes of
<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, or of <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> or
<i>Star Trek: Deep Space 9</i>, learn about Jewish culture and some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Near_East">Near East history</a>,
read Dumas’
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers"><i>The Three
Musketeers</i></a>, etc. etc. all of which I can highly recommended. I’m not
charging people any money to download, build, or view the works, but I
have some web commercials which I’m making some small money from, and which
I hope are acceptable to the copyright holders. Please don’t sue me.
