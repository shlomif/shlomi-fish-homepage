<p>
When I was in high school, some of my friends, their family members
and I used to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football">football ("soccer")</a> together. During one game, one member
of the opponent team has advanced enough towards our goal, that several
of my team members thought it was going to be a score for sure and
stopped running.
</p>

<p>
However, I ran quickly towards the goalposts, and was able to divert the ball
by kicking it in mid-air, thus preventing a goal. So the lesson is to not give up too easily.
