          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: I found out that my project compiles really quickly.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: under 5 or 10 minutes on a P4-2.4GHz with 1 GB of RAM.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: maybe KDE is making g++ look bad.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">rindolf: yeah, i'm not a big KDE fan</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: actually I'm using KDE-3.5.8 here.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: I was talking about the compilation speed of KDE apps and KDE itself.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: possibly because each file has half-a-gazillion headers.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">My C++ code is a server one, so we don't have too many deps.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">yeah, isn't there a way to cache header files? ie. in their "compiled" form?</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">or is that something I'm remembering from some other programming language that purported to build on top of C?</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: MSVC has that.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">ahh, nods</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: no, Visual C++ has precompiled headers.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: I remember that I kept deleting them.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">yeah, couldn't remember</saying>

          <saying who="rindolf">Pascal compiles very quickly.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">That's one of the things I enjoyed in Delphi.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">ugh, the app i'm been maintaining in Java was originally a fat client/server desktop app, written in Delphi</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: ah.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">i remember booting up the old app for the first time, and being amazed at how slow it was</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">eventually, i had to duplicate a feature in the Java code and i wasn't sure how it was implemented before</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: you mean the Java app is faster? :S</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">so being as i had no Delphi experience, and the newer Delphi environments made NO sense to me at all, i just opened up the SQL Server query analyzer</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">rindolf: yes, but only b/c the Delphi programmer was an idiot, issuing queries over and over again needlessly</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">rindolf: if you could've seen the MSSQL Performance Analyzer or whatever, it was basically just.. Query1, Query2, Query3, Query1, Query2, Query3, repeat.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">it was probably the worst ive ever seen in my life.. belongs on www.thedailywtf.com </saying>

<saying who="ne2k__">yrlnry: not that it has anything to do with perl, but the &lt;input&gt; tag in HTML has both &quot;name&quot; and &quot;value&quot; attributes. the value is what gets shown in the browser typically.</saying>

<saying who="perlygatekeeper">rindolf was that someone pretending to be me?</saying>
<saying who="perlygatekeeper">I never said those things</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlygatekeeper: it&#39;s a fictitious story.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlygatekeeper: relax.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">perlygatekeeper: or you could be the imposter right now... or maybe just schizophrenic.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: MPDed not schizophrenic.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: schizophrenia is not Multi-Persona-Disordered.</saying>
<saying who="b0at">perlygatekeeper: It&#39;s fan fiction from your fan!</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">rindolf: what&#39;s the difference?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: MPD is when there are several personalities living inside your brain.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: in schizophrenia, you have one I-ness, but hear voices, hallucinate and stuff.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">rindolf: Ah. Why is it considered a disorder? MPD could be quite useful... One would have different perspectives on a subject.</saying>
<saying who="perlygatekeeper">where&#39;s beth, she&#39;ll know it&#39;s me</saying>
<saying who="integral">But how will we know it&#39;s beth?!</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">rindolf: Oh, I have MPD then, not schizophrenia. I don&#39;t hallucinate.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">integral: WE DON&#39;T!</saying>
<saying who="b0at">I don&#39;t hallucinate, but my other personality does.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">How do I know all of you exist? Am I just a figment of my own imagination?</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">b0at: Interesting...</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: Julian Jaynes describes schizophrenia very well in his &quot;The Origins of Consciousness during the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind book&quot;.</saying>

<saying who="dabreegster">Wait, I do have the Voices. Maybe I have MPD _and_ schizophrenia.</saying>
<saying who="b0at">Ah, but the question is: do the Voices have voices?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Consciousness_in_the_Breakdown_of_the_Bicameral_Mind</saying>
<saying who="b0at">And if so, is it your own voice?</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">b0at: And do the voices of the voices have voices?</saying>
<saying who="b0at">That&#39;s just going too far.</saying>
<saying who="dkr">don&#39;t worry, those are angels, invest in tarot cards and you will be able to understand them</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">b0at: and if it&#39;s not, then could it be the voice of........ integral? rindolf? or.... buu!</saying>
<saying who="b0at">buu has other plans for our empty skulls</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">b0at: and if they do, then what do the voices of the voices of the voices of the Voices sound like?</saying>
<saying who="integral">*sob* it&#39;s the cabbages.   The cabbages keep telling me to do things</saying>

<saying who="dabreegster">The lawn gnomes tell me to stay away from Life. They force me to write poetry.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">markl_: there are plenty of other web-devel frameworks.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlbot: web frameworks</saying>
<saying who="perlbot">rindolf: CGI-Application (and Titanium), CGI-Application-Plus, CGI-Builder, CGI-Prototype, Jifty, Catalyst (and Reaction), Mojo, SweetPea, Dancer, Gantry, AxKit, WebGUI</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">markl_: yeah.</saying>
<saying who="markl_">what are the easiest ones for people good with perl but not HTML/CSS/AJAX experts ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">markl_: not that Ruby or PHP have fewer.</saying>
<saying who="markl_">or the most widely adopted one ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">markl_: the most popular appears to be Catalyst.</saying>
<saying who="markl_">catalyst seems to at least have a book :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">markl_: it has several books.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">markl_: I worked a bit with Mojolicious, and it wasn&#39;t too bad, but it reinvents a lot of wheels.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Due to its philosophy.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">markl_: I also did some Catalyst projects.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">mst: I think that&#39;s the case, no need to preach to mutewit about it.</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">mutewit: I did, and figured out the soln. when switching windows.</saying>
<saying who="mst">mutewit: aye. I&#39;m just trying to explain how to get the most learning out of us as well as the most working code.</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">sometimes thinks we spend much more IRC volume discussing netiquette than actually suffering from the bad netiquette.</me_is>
<saying who="mutewit">But by the time I came back to the channel there was a whole page of &quot;preaching&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">I was using a split method with array indexing and it felt too much like a C-approach.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: oh, you split the string into chars?</saying>
<saying who="mst">yeah, by the time you&#39;ve done map, join, split, ...</saying>
<saying who="mst">you&#39;ve basically just reimplemented substr badly :)</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">rindolf: That&#39;s what I was doing, but the map/substr approach is a lot cleaner.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: yeah/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: split into chars sometimes has some uses.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: but this reminds me too much of SICP.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlbot: sicp</saying>
<saying who="perlbot">rindolf: http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/ - &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot; - A Classical Text on Programming</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: see - http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Too-Many-Ways/slides/slide13.html</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: this is how an SICP programmer will implement a simple text processing task.</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">SICP, love the book.</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">and all the OCaml work this year has given rise to a functional bent of mind</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">which is kinda screwing around with my perl code.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: yeah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Too-Many-Ways/slides/slide12.html - this is the fastest Perl solution.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">At least in speed.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">It can be a little shorter with a regex lookahead, but it&#39;s less elegant and slower.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Too-Many-Ways/slides/slide9.html - there you go.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: did you know how to program before reading SICP?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I think it&#39;s not a good introductory book.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">MIT are going to ditch it in favour of some Python/Robotics curriculum.</saying>
<saying who="mst">I think it&#39;s only a good introductory book if you know some math and have the brain to follow it</saying>
<saying who="mst">it teaches a lot of hard concepts very quickly</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">mst: from a &quot;I&#39;m from the humanities department&quot; point of view it&#39;s managable. it&#39;s not easy, but everyone can work with it.</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">eval: $_ = &quot;0123456789abcdefgh&quot;; [ /(?=(.{5}))/g ]</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: ah. Using what?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">tybalt89++ # Up for the challenge.</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">and yes, MIT ditched SICP in favor of a Python-based intro course.</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">rindolf: I was off in other windows :(</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">mutewit: ^^  for 5 char slices</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: don&#39;t use it if you want future generations to understand it.</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">slaps tybalt89 with mst&#39;s slipper for golfing mutewit&#39;s solution and telling him it&#39;s a good idea.</me_is>
<saying who="tybalt89">rindolf: that&#39;s not golfing, just common simple regex :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">tybalt89: sigh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">tybalt89: simple.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">irregular regular expression.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Maybe use Regexp::Common</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">I added in tybalt89&#39;s code but commented it for future reference.</saying>
<saying who="mst">I&#39;d definitely use the substr approach for real code</saying>
<saying who="mst">tybalt89&#39;s code is cleverness to prove it can be done; I don&#39;t believe he was recommending it</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">mst: sigh, yes, I am recommending it.  It&#39;s the clearest solution.</saying>
<saying who="mst">tybalt89: I respectfully disagree.</saying>
<saying who="mst">I find the substr approach far more obvious</saying>
<saying who="Chazz">rindolf, ty. :)</saying>
<saying who="mst">but then, I mostly write applications perl rather than scripts, so I only engage in regexp cleverness when actively useful</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">tybalt89: look-aheads and look-behinds are dark corners of the Perl not-so-reg-regexes</saying>
<saying who="Yaakov">In the context of this particular problem, it&#39;s pretty straightforward, but, knowledge of the development/maintenance team(s) would push my choce one way or another.</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">mst: note it took rindolf three tries, and even then he got it wrong.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">tybalt89: well, I&#39;m not focused now.</saying>
<saying who="mst">tybalt89: map substr($str, $_, 5), 0 .. length($str)-5; ?</saying>
<saying who="mst">maybe -6</saying>
<me_is who="tybalt89">turns the lens, trying to focus rindolf </me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">mst: -5</saying>
<saying who="mst">but it&#39;s hardly difficult; rindolf&#39;s just having a day of silly mistakes</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Unit tests!</saying>
<saying who="mst">I&#39;d expect him to get it right first time when on form too :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Some clear code is hard to get right.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Doesn&#39;t make it less clear.</saying>
<saying who="mst">yeah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Most people will not write a correct binary search at first try.</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">&quot;maybe -6&quot; is proof of unclearness :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">But the correct binary search is easy to digest.</saying>
<saying who="mst">tybalt89: no, it&#39;s proof it&#39;s 8pm on a sunday and I&#39;m not particularly awake either</saying>
<saying who="mst">but your code just made me go &quot;hang on, WHAT?!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="mst">then I had to stop and dissect it</saying>
<saying who="mst">-then- I saw what you were doing</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mst++</saying>
<saying who="mst">also, the substr approach displays the semantics and the reasoning</saying>
<saying who="mst">whereas the regex approach displays, well, line noise, frankly</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mst: why don&#39;t we agree to disagree with tybalt89 ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mst: so how&#39;s the weather? ;-)</saying>

<saying who="designerjean">i know i&#39;m not supposed to be using XML::Simple</saying>
<saying who="designerjean">but it&#39;s only one statement in the program</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">designerjean: is it causing problems?</saying>
<saying who="mst">yes, and it&#39;s the one that makes the $config you can&#39;t work out how to use</saying>
<saying who="designerjean">maybe</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mst: :-)</saying>
<saying who="mst">your exact problem is &quot;unable to use the results of XML::Simple&quot;</saying>
<saying who="mst">because you&#39;re stupid and XML::Simple is shit</saying>
<saying who="mst">please switch to XML::Twig</saying>
<saying who="designerjean">ok thanks</saying>
<saying who="dhoss">people still use xml?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dhoss: it&#39;s a dirty job, but it pays.</saying>
<saying who="dhoss">i guess there&#39;s that</saying>
<saying who="designerjean">another case of stupid youth</saying>
<saying who="dhoss">designerjean: how old are you</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dhoss: well, I&#39;m using XML for some stuff willingly.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dhoss: JSON wouldn&#39;t have been usable.</saying>
<saying who="dhoss">rindolf: i guess that&#39;s a legit reason</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Because I use them for text and stuff like that.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And it&#39;s hard to do something like &lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;b&gt;dhoss&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; in JSON.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">I think its mainly amongst web programmers where JSON is appreciated the most.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: JSON has many valid uses.</saying>
<saying who="DuClare">XML has none</saying>
<saying who="LeoNerd">XML is for putting attribute markup within a stream of text.</saying>
<saying who="dhoss">rindolf: yea i can see that. json is more useful in a cross language barrier bit where markup isn&#39;t needed</saying>
<saying who="LeoNerd">(mostly because it came out of SGML)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">DuClare: not true.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">XML is very widely used. that&#39;s like saying &quot;I dont need to know Java, because the language sucks&quot; ..</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">rindolf: you&#39;re mixing semantics with style here anyways. that would be bad xml.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: I was giving an illustrative example.</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">rindolf: then give a proper one. that was exactly how NOT to XML.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: besides , I think that &lt;b&gt; has some valid, semantic meaning.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And it&#39;s also shorter than &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: ok.</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">rindolf: no. bold doesn&#39;t mean &quot;be bold and courageous here&quot;. it means &quot;print this shit in bold typeface&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">&lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;name&gt;Su-Shee&lt;/name&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">XML is useful for wrapping and annotating text.</saying>
<saying who="Dorward">XML is only useful for wrapping and annotating text if you use a properly designed application of XML and everyone reading the document agrees on what the meaning is.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">XTML vs XDML could derive from XML. (text and data respectively). then of course you should be able to embed XDML in XTML.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">oh wait. Im thinkin aloud.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: I&#39;ve recently played with an XML-specific compression tool.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: it achieved better compression than xz -9 --extreme but OTOH mishandled some «&quot;» not inside attributes - converting them to &amp;quot;</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">rindolf: what requirements are you trying to meet by compressing xml?</saying>
<saying who="PerlJam">smaller XML docs :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: well, to reduce the size.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">well, doh. but why?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: like over the Net, etc.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: it&#39;s like gzip compression/decompression.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">rindolf: I yet fail to see the point. :(</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Only domain-specific.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">why?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And if you have a lot of it it occupies less on the hard disk.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">Ah. you have like SHITLOADS of XML ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">It could happen.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Java...</saying>
<saying who="PerlJam">anyone who deals with XML probably has that much  ;)</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">Well, disk is pretty cheap.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I don&#39;t have too much XML.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, maybe a lot of XHTML.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">I was just curious about rindolf&#39;s use case.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">I was afraid that he was storing some binary data in XML. :)</saying>
<saying who="mst">I think he was just experimenting with technology</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Yes, I probably have more disk wasted on .mp3&#39;s and .flv&#39;s. </saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: I have some interest in compression methods.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: back from high school.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">rindolf: :)</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">if you&#39;re the company who&#39;s transferring 120 years of documents of a car company into something flexible - THEN you have a shitload of XML.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">There have been some recent advancements.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">So just out of curiousity, that&#39;s fine with me. :) Im just nosy sometimes.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: I think the wikipedia XML dump is pretty large.</saying>
<saying who="mst">I find it&#39;s usually safe to assume that whatver rindolf&#39;s doing, there isn&#39;t a good reason for it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: there was some stuff about processing it quickly using Perl, etc.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mst: :-)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mst++ # Nice burn.</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">popcorn anyone? ;)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mst: but it has a huge grain of truth in it I admit.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: microwave popcorn?</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">I don&#39;t have a microwave and I was being sarcastic...</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">I need a smiley for that.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">rindolf-shaped, obviously.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: yes, I was playing along.</saying>
<saying who="petn-randall">why not an XML-conform &lt;/sarcasm&gt; ?</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">prepares some popcorn and shares it with Su-Shee using the Popcorn-over-IRC protocol.</me_is>
<saying who="DrForr">What&#39;s this about burnt popcorn?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Popcorn-over-IRC also preserves the butter taste.</saying>
<saying who="burnedcelery">you&#39;re getting my keyboard all greasy</saying>
<saying who="apeiron">ew, butter</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And it also supports multicasting popcorn.</saying>

<saying who="rp21">hey, why did my nick change?</saying>
<saying who="rp2">yes it may be perfectionism</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rp2: ah, sucks.</saying>
<saying who="rp2">eg i want to get all columns from a database table in Perl</saying>
<saying who="rp2">now my problem is that i want to write code that works wuith a variety of databases and both on windows and linux</saying>
<saying who="rp2">it seems that as soon as i have found a way to overcome a particular restriction, i mentally add another and spend my time trying to overcome that too, sometimes losing track of the reason i started the script</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rp2: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rp2">if i were a better programmer i&#39;d get through the hurdles quicker and end up with solvesworldhunger.pl</saying>

                <p>
                    (This bit was posted anonymously to a pastebot on 23 March,
                    2011. It is placed her for posterity after some editing.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Question: how can I switch off my TV?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What he wants to hear? For example: Locate on/off button
                    your TV remote a press it. The button is usually red and
                    located at the topmost line on the remote.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The #perl expert's answer: First, what do you mean with
                    "switch off"? Define it first. Nopaste your TV, TV remote
                    and the living room too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a nopaste:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your room is ugly. And the TV looks terrible. Use
                    <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Clean">Mr.
                        Clean</a> on the screen and clean your living room
                    first. Use three cleaning mops instead of two. Use HDMI and
                    never use scart (?) connectors, unless you really want to.
                    Your TV remote has unreadable buttons, clean up first.

<saying who="Altreus">LeoNerd: is it core?</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">HOP has a nice implementation.  It works by generating a list of every string matched by the regex, and looking to see if your target string is in the list.</saying>
<saying who="LeoNerd">I can&#39;t help thinking that may not be optimal in terms of CPU or memory usage</saying>
<saying who="talexb">yrlnry, no doubt they have a Cray working on generating the list ..</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">LeoNerd:  Depends; unlike Perl regexes, it has no trouble handling languages higher up the Chomsky hierarchy</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">It is guaranteed to return the right answer for any recursive language, and guaranteed to return correct &#39;matched&#39; answers for any recursively enumerable language.</saying>
<saying who="LeoNerd">Ohsure...</saying>
<saying who="LeoNerd">In terms of CS guarantees it&#39;s very nice</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">So if you are in a big hurry to get the wrong answer...</saying>
<saying who="LeoNerd">But I live in the practical pragmatic world</saying>
<saying who="LeoNerd">E.g. Parser::MGC is horribly slow at backtracking and whatnot, but I write parsers in it because those are still fast for &quot;reasonably&quot; sized inputs, parsers are fast to write, and I like having lots of side-effects and dynamic logic -in- Perl</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">Unfortunately my universe doesn&#39;t have infinite processing speeds and data storage</saying>
<saying who="anno">a universe with infinite processing speed would have processed you by now</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">and</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">would have processed my grandchildren too</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">This algorithm doesn&#39; t need infinite speed or storage.</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">It works slowly, but finitely.</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">what</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">The infinite list is lazily generated and you never have more than one of its elements in memory at any time.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">yrlnry: is it sorted by length?</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">You will learn this sort of technique after you have been programming in Perl for eight months or so.</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">how do you know when it doesn&#39;t match</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">yrlnry: :D</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">rindolf:  it is sorted by length, and lexicographically among strings of the same length.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">yrlnry: ah.</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">Of course, you cannot do the length-sorting thing for arbitrary languages, but for regex languages there is no trouble.</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/pdf/06InfiniteStreams.pdf</saying>
<saying who="LeoNerd">Eh..</saying>
<saying who="LeoNerd">I dunno. I just dislike purely RE-based parsing</saying>
<saying who="LeoNerd">I much prefer code doing it</saying>
<saying who="GordonFreeman">why can&#39;t perl regexp do variable length lookbehind matching?</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">See originally I ignored you because it sounded like you were talking shit</saying>
<saying who="LeoNerd">Limit of the implementation</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">mainly because it is possible to construct a regex with an infinite range that nevertheless won&#39;t match a particular string</saying>
<saying who="anno">GordonFreeman: who knows? looks like it&#39;s hard to implement with the given engine</saying>
<saying who="mauke">GordonFreeman: unclear semantics and no one&#39;s bothered to write the code</saying>
<saying who="GordonFreeman">i see</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">Plus, there&#39;s a fucking lot of unicode to create strings out of</saying>
<saying who="LeoNerd">It&#39;s not &quot;hard&quot; to implement. It&#39;s impossible given the algorithm being used</saying>
<saying who="mauke">LeoNerd: why impossible?</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">LeoNerd:  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.  It could be done using a recursive call to the regex engine now that that is possible.</saying>
<saying who="GordonFreeman">but lookbehind is cool</saying>
<saying who="LeoNerd">Oooh.. yes.. I suppose it could do that now</saying>
<saying who="GordonFreeman">its like a reverse regexp that can be excluded</saying>
<saying who="anno">vim re&#39;s do it</saying>
<saying who="LeoNerd">vim uses a different type of engine</saying>
<saying who="anno">right</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">Altreus:  I was talking shit.  After eight months you get a license to do that.</saying>
<saying who="mauke">really?</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">yrlnry: but there&#39;s a pdf</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">where&#39;s a PDF?</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">17:10 &lt; yrlnry&gt; http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/pdf/06InfiniteStreams.pdf</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">Yes.</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">I didn&#39;t open it or anything</saying>
<saying who="mauke">no one opens pdfs</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">PDFs are for cowards and Slavs.</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">but it lent enough credence to your words that I decided to believe your spurious claims</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">Actually someone did a test the other day</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">Oh, does &quot;talking shit&quot; mean &quot;making up nonsense&quot;?  Then I was not talking shit.</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">He linked someone to articles supporting his viewpoint and they changed their mind</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">It is in section 6.5, &quot;regex string generation&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">but one of the articles was an argument against himself</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">Showing that it is enough to cite your sources to be believed; not many people will actually bother to check them</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">yrlnry: what do you normally think &quot;talking shit&quot; means?</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">are you confusing it with shooting the shit</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">I&#39;m not sure.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">jozefk: you can define a print stylesheet.</saying>
<saying who="jozefk">I want to clean the page from everything. not only to see it like that on screen but to really modify the code</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">jozefk: well, you can read what the bookmarklet is doing and emulate it.</saying>
<saying who="jozefk">I see the javascript code from bookmarklet but I think I can&#39;t modify real files on hard disk with javacript codes</saying>
<saying who="jozefk">and the code is more than 300 lines :)</saying>
<saying who="tm604">sure you can, js runs serverside happily enough, but it&#39;d be just as easy to convert the JS logic to perl.</saying>
<saying who="jozefk">that sounds like programing. I thought there is some tool like that bookmarklet which I can use to modify files on HDD</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">tm604: except the JS runs on a DOM in a browser, with a browser context</saying>
<saying who="tm604">yes, it does sound a bit like programming, doesn&#39;t it? good thing this is a programming channel, so it&#39;s hopefully still on-topic.</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a node module that will load an HTML file and create a browser context in which to then run JS on that HTML&#39;s DOM and output the result</saying>
<saying who="jozefk">:)</saying>
<saying who="jozefk">DOM is not so important here I think. because JS is removing everything from code and just applying another CSS</saying>
<saying who="jozefk">so the page looks different</saying>
<saying who="tm604">huh, thought there was. the script itself should be trivial to convert to perl either way.</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">probably a better idea :)</saying>

<saying who="ncow">rindolf: is not   { my $c=0; sub getNext { $c++ } }   a perfectly good way to do a closure on a variable (that should not be seen by anything other than that sub, sort of like that PHP example with the &quot;static&quot; var &lt;http://www.phpsadness.com/sad/18&gt; and I think similar to static vars in C++ and Java) ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ncow: yes, it is.</saying>
<saying who="uri">ncow: you can use state vars in recent perls too</saying>
<saying who="ncow">but I keep thinking there was a way of doing it with outer and inner subs too, or no</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ncow: thing is in sub outer { my $c = 0 ; .... } the $c is temporary.</saying>
<saying who="ncow">uri: yeah I just saw that in perlfaq7 just before you said that, thanks though :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ncow: which causes weird side-effects with a package-scope inner sub.</saying>
<saying who="ncow">rindolf: but shouldn&#39;t the inner sub have a closure over $c though?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ncow: it will.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ncow: but every time you call outer() you get a different $c.</saying>
<saying who="apeiron">Windows also accepts a sledgehammer to the harddrive.</saying>
<saying who="ncow">rindolf: I&#39;m talking about calling the inner one</saying>
<saying who="ncow">rindolf: could be interesting to call the outter one to re-prime or something (just kind of thinking aloud, I could be completely wrong)</saying>
<saying who="ncow">(please let me know if I am)</saying>
<saying who="cj">Botje: that&#39;s not the point.  Some systems don&#39;t :)</saying>

<saying who="ncow">It says: sub counter { state $count = 1; $counter++ }</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">apeiron: http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=joel-forum-unix-shooting-in-the-foot</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ncow: yes, it should.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ncow: or &quot;$state $counter = 1;&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="ncow">rindolf: oh shit, that is so true. I hate ActiveX like the mf-ing plauge</saying>
<saying who="ncow">rindolf: yes, though counter is the sub&#39;s name, I think the var was meant to be called $count</saying>
<saying who="ncow">as in the count that the counter counts :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ncow++</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ncow: it still exists in my github fork of the perl-doc-cats repo.</saying>

<saying who="Altreus">That&#39;s generous</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Altreus: calling someone a &quot;poo poo head&quot; proves that this person has natural stupidity.</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">rindolf: But the natural stupidity was postulated before the use of the phrase; hence you can&#39;t discount the fact that using the phrase was in response to, rather than proof of, the assertion.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Altreus: yes, but it still proved it after the fact.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Altreus: Q.E.D.</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">rindolf: Except it is possible for an intelligent system to act stupid</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Altreus: OK.</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">You would have to gather further data on the system to determine it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Altreus: in that case, calling someone a &quot;poo poo head&quot; has the property of having natural stupidity.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Hence stupid phrases are not indicative.</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">Quite so</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Only intelligent phrases can be indicative of something.</saying>
<saying who="Altreus">Stupidity is an absence, and you cannot prove an absence without first proving an exhaustive set.</saying>
