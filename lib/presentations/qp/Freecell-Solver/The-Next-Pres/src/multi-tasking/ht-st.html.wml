Freecell Solver distinguishes between two levels of tasks:
</li>
<li>
<b>1. Soft Thread</b> - a soft thread is one dedicated scan running
on the state collection.
</li>
<li>
<b>2. Hard Thread</b> - a task that should be performed by one system thread 
with all the dedicated resources that should prevent collisions with other 
hard threads as much as possible.
</li>
<li>
A hard thread switches between several soft threads.
</li>
<li>
At the moment, hard threads can not be multi-threaded using the system
threads, as no locking mechanisms are in place. But the distinction still 
exists in the code.
