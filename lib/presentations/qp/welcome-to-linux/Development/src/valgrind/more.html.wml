<li>
Valgrind does not require special compilation. You simply execute it like
so: <tt>valgrind --num-callers=15 progname</tt>. It will run the program
<tt>progname</tt> and intercept calls to malloc/free/new/delete and
monitor all memory uses.
</li>
<li>
Another useful flag is <tt>--gdb-attach=yes</tt> that invokes gdb on the
process when errors are detected, and let you debug the place of the
error.
</li>
<li>
Valgrind works only on x86s running a modern Linux version. (<b>Update:</b>
it can now work on other operating systems and architectures as well.)
</li>
<li>
Valgrind will report several types of errors:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Illegal read / illegal write errors.
</li>
<li>
Use of uninitialized values.
</li>
<li>
Illegal frees.
</li>
<li>
Inappropriate deallocation function.
</li>
<li>
Passing system call parameters with inadequate read/write permissions.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Valgrind will tell you, when possible, where in your code the relevant memory
blocks were allocated/freed.
</li>
<li>
Valgrind is most probably not installed on the Linux box you are working on,
however installation is trivial and fairly quick: download, unpack and then
run one after another:<br />
<tt>./configure</tt><br />
<tt>make</tt><br />
<tt>make install</tt><br />
</li>
<li>
Valgrind's manual is available in the directory of its unpacked distribution
under <tt>docs/index.html</tt>.
