<p>
<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The GIMP</a> is a sophisticated image
processing and composition program available for UNIXes and several other
platforms (including
<a href="http://www.gimp.org/windows/">Win32</a> and
<a href="http://www.macgimp.org/">Mac OS X</a>)
. The GIMP includes many features attractive to graphics professionals and
novices alike, and is up-to-par with commercial offerings such as Adobe
Photoshop.
</p>

<p>
While several entire books were written on the GIMP, this talk does not
aim to be a comprehensive introduction or not even an introduction to the
most basic elements. Rather it should give a taste of several things that
can be done with this program, and let the user experience further on his or
her own.
</p>

<p>
This talk has now been updated to GIMP 2.2. The
<a href="1/slides/">older slides, intended for GIMP 1.2.x</a>
are still available, but it is recommended not to use GIMP 1.2 any more.
