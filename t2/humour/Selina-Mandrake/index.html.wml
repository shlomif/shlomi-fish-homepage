<latemp_meta_desc "Selina Mandrake - The Slayer (Buffy Parody) - a geeky Anglo-American high school senior in 2011 California discovers she is none other than the legendary heroine “The Slayer”, who is destined to slay many notable demons." />

<selina_mandrake_common_top_elems />

<p>
This is a parody of the television series
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_%28TV_series%29">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>, while referencing other pieces of popular
culture, and has many ties to my other screenplay,
<a href="$(ROOT)/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">Star Trek: “We, the
Living Dead”</a>. It’s far-fetched, but, on the other hand, conveys some
serious messages and insights.
</p>

<p>
Hope you enjoy it!

<p>
Well, since this work is a parody of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer"><i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i></a> (written by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon">Joss
Whedon</a>), and contains characters from there,
I am theoretically protected by the Copyright’s
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use#Fair_use_and_parody">“right of

Buffy’s works online and possibly offline, and no one was sued yet.

<p>
This work also uses other characters and concepts, from other copyrighted

the situation is more complicated than that.

<p>
I’m putting it here on this site in hope it will amuse or inspire
people, and also because it may encourage people to watch some episodes of
<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, or of <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> or

read Dumas’

charging people any money to download, build, or view the works, but I
have some web commercials which I’m making some small money from, and which
I hope are acceptable to the copyright holders. Please don’t sue me.

<a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppets_%282011%29"><i>The Muppets (2011)</i> film</a>
- I saw this film in the cinema and was impressed by its take on a brutal
honesty criticism of various 2010s culture, as seen by the apparently more old
fashioned (but still funny as ever) muppets. I eventually decided to adopt a
similar approach in writing <i>Selina</i>, both as a criticism of some
of our contemporary culture, and more importantly as a way to honestly convey
my farfetched imaginary world (induced by a long period of
<a href="$(ROOT)/philosophy/psychology/hypomanias/">hypomanias and manias</a>)
into this screenplay.

<p>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter">Harry Potter
franchise</a> - I believe now that I drew some inspiration from Harry Potter
in the fact that Selina starts as a normal teenager, who just happens to
be geeky and knowledgeable enough to be dangerous.
</p>

<p>
However, like Harry Potter and his good friend Hermione Granger,
she secretly wishes that there was more to this world than meets the eye,
only to discover this is the case, to her great apparent dismay. And now
she has to find a way to handle the situation gracefully.
</p>

<p>
While Harry and Hermione find assistance using supernatural magic, Selina only
has her own natural slaying resources of her words and actions, which turn
out to be enough.
