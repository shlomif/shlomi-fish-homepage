<points>


<li>
Gimp contains a database of named procedures.
</li>

<li>
This database is flat, so care must be taken to maintain namespace
integrity
</li>

<li>
Scripting extensions can interact with the GIMP by accessing the
functions through their names in the database.
</li>

<li>
This list can be viewed by accessing:


<menupath>
<code>
&lt;Toolbox&gt; -&gt; Xtns -&gt; "DB Browser..."
</code>
</menupath>
</li>

<li>
It is evident that there are several classes of functions which are
distinguished by their prefix.
