[
Text on the screen: Sunnydale High School Orientation Day ; Sunnydale ; California.
First few chords of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M11SvDtPBhA">Miley
Cyrus’ “Party In The U.S.A”</a>. Rebecca “Becky” Shepherd is shown
walking in the high school lobby listening to the song playing from her
smartphone that is tucked on her belt. She is wearing a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony%3A_Friendship_Is_Magic">My
Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</a> shirt, and has a name tag that reads
"Rebecca Shepherd (Slayer)".

<p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Yo, brony girl - stop!
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Hey, sorry for not paying attention <span class="inlinedesc">[she pauses the music]</span>. What’s
up?
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Chankey here <span class="inlinedesc">[points at Chankey]</span> and I are looking for a slayer to
complete our team. You don't seem exactly like slayer-material, but since
all the other slayers we talked with were taken , I guess we should settle
on you.
</p>
<p>
[
Becky smiles.

</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> sure, I'd love to be team with you. Let's register.
</p>
<p>

She uses her smartphone to register.

</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> OK, done.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[in an English accent]</span> Smashing!
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Chankey, is it? Are you British?
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> Yes, Miss Shepherd.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> “Becky” please.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> Yes, well, I am of Indian descent and carry an Indian name. I have
photographic memory, and did extremely well in my studies. I was supposed to
start studying in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School">Harrow
School</a> (the notorious public school, or what you Americans will call a
“private school”) because I had many friends there, but then became aware
of some demonic activity in Greater London, and was indoctrinated as a
watcher-wannabe here.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> I don't have any friends here.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Grabbing his hand.]</span> I'm sure you’ll make some.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> Yes.

I added the section about
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/#rindolf_aim_very_high_hitlower">Rindolf
“Aim Very High” Hitlower</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Not only is Rindolf an evil Reindeer but he is the notorious insane tyrant and
mass-murderer, Rindolf “Aim Very High” Hitlower. As you may have guessed,
people said that my nickname “Rindolf” reminded them of “Adolf Hitler”, and
even though I was offended by it for a long time, I eventually decided to
take it to my advantage too. Recently (Late June, 2014) I’ve told people that I
decided that in my personal and professional life, I will aim very high in the
hope that I will hit the aim or perhaps a little lower, and so settled on this
nickname.
