The first revision of a new essay,
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/high-quality-software/">“What 
    Makes Software High-Quality?”</a> (with a focus on
open-source software) was added to the essays section:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    <b>The Program is Available for Downloading or Buying</b>
    </p>

    <p>
    That may seem like a silly thing to say, but you’ll be surprised how many
    times people get it wrong. How many times have you seen web-sites of
    software that claim that the new version of the software (or even the
    first) is currently under work, will change the world, but is not available
    yet? How many times have you heard of web-sites that are not live yet, and
    refuse to tell people exactly what they are about?

More text has been added to the screenplay
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">Star
    Trek: “We the Living Dead”</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    <b>Katie:</b> Professor Shlomo Abramovich? You’re King Solomo... Errr... 
    I’m not talking with you again. [Goes to sit on the Swing, frustrated.]
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Shlomo:</b> Mosheh, remember I told you about Katie?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mosheh:</b> oh yeah! She looks cute when she’s angry.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Katie:</b> Moses, right?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mosheh:</b> that’s right.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Katie:</b> well, in case you’ve had any interest in me, I should note 
    that I have a policy against getting involved with people who are 4 times 
    my senior or more.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mosheh:</b> relax! I have married girls who were 15 times my junior or
    more and my own descendants, and retrospectively I can tell that many of
    them were more mature and rational than I was in most respects.
    </p>
