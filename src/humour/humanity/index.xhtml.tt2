The original <a href="http://humanity.shlomifish.org/">Humanity project</a>, back in 2000 was my opening shot of the <a
href="[% base_path %]me/resumes/Shlomi-Fish-Resume-as-Writer-Entertainer.html">the
open content / Web 2.0 revolution</a> aiming to be a "bazaar-style"
collaborative project for writing a screenplay. It fuzzled out due to the
clunky <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System">CVS</a> UI, but nowadays collaboratively written screenplays are
common - only using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wiki_software">wiki
software</a>
or <a href="https://better-scm.shlomifish.org/docs/this-site-is-irrelevant/">git DVCS</a>
or similar.

I originally envisioned the film with the first written scenes as having
been written and filmed by a <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Bajoran">Bajoran</a>
extraterrestrial (but human-like) visitor to Earth, during an extended period
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania">Mania</a> around 1997.
He came to Earth to study its cultures, and <i>Humanity</i> was his way of parodying
and paying tribute to them. I also imagined that the terran film crew filmed it
using 2-D equipment, but it ended up as a 3-D film.
