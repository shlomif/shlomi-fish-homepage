Airport clerk: Next, please. Name and passport?

EmWatson: Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson; actress and model and UN Women
ambassador of good will.

Airport clerk: The passport looks legit. What are you planning to do in Israel?

EmWatson: Touring and political activism. I’m not planning to be employed (and
if I do - I’ll let you know about it) but I am planning to visit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_envelope">the Gaza envelope</a>,
broadcast my exact location on the Internet, and try to bring
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalom">Shalom / Salaam</a> to the
region.

Airport clerk: Seems crazy.

EmWatson: Well, I am sane enough to act crazy sometimes.

Airport clerk: Oh well, I doubt you’ll be in any remote danger anyway, and
since you are a British citizen, we cannot really prevent you from entering.

+++: Try not to get killed.

EmWatson: Thank you! I will.

Showing EmWatson’s Smartphone on Twitter she types there -
“Visit to Israel Begins. GPS coords in RT at emw.tld. Sderot,
here I come!”, and sends it.

She approaches a taxicab driver.

EmWatson: Hello there.

Driver: Hello Ma’am. Do you want a ride?

EmWatson: That I do! Note however that my phone will broadcast my exact
GPS coordinates every minute or so, so if you care about “privacy” (in quotes)
I’ll have to find someone else. On the bright side, I’m going to pay you
10 thousand sheqels regardless of how much the ride should cost, and also -
I’m Emma Watson, the famous actress, so— I can give you a signed photograph,
and a small souvenir, and naturally we’ll talk during the ride.

Driver: Works for me. Where do you wish to go?

EmWatson: Sderot, please! But can we first stop at a gas station, where we can
eat and drink something?

Driver: Sure, Miss Watson! Let me help you with your bags.

[ Cut to them sitting eating. ]

EmWatson: Sorry if I’m too distracted and not too talkative, but I’m trying
to reply to as many of the social media responses I got for my recent
announcement of me going to visit the Gaza envelope. One thing I learned
from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bpVrKm9QCc">Shaike
Ophir’s English Teacher skit</a> is that one should avoid his definition
of monologue as “one person talking to himself”.

Driver: That’s OK, Miss Watson - the customer’s always right.

EmWatson: Yes. I received quite a few variations of “Bitch, are you
insane?” from fans, to which I made a top-level reply of “For all the people
who think I’m insane, be aware that if I complied by the mainstream definition
of sanity, I would not be half as successful as I am today.” (only in
Twitter-speak).
