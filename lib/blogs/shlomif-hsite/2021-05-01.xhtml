<h2>The Commercial Fanfiction Initiative</h2>

<p>
The biggest news is the <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/">commercial fanfiction initiative</a>,
which aims to make the film industry flourish just like
open music on youtube/etc. or FOSS in the software world.
The scope is somewhat larger, covering accepting screenplays
in easier-to-write formats, and being communicative about why
a screenplay was rejected.

<p>
Some people online told me "commercial fanfiction will never happen"
and two fellow writers of (gratis, Internet-hosted) fanfiction said
it will be "unethical" to try to profit off other writers' hard work.
However, I recall people expressing similar sentiments about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">open source software</a>
and <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/case-for-file-swapping/">early
music file swapping / file sharing / "piracy"</a>
and Wikipediaâ€¦ I often grow older and more foolish, and some people
do support the cause.
