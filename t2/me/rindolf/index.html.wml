<h2 id="what">“Rindolf” - Shlomi Fish’s Nickname</h2>

<p>
I, Shlomi Fish, have decided to allow people on and off IRC
(= Internet Relay Chat) to call me
“Rindolf”, due to the fact that some non-Hebrew inclined people have problems
with my private name - <a href="$(ROOT)/meta/FAQ/#your_name">“Shlomi”</a>.
Some common pet names for Rindolf include “Rin”,
“Rinny”, “Rindy”, “Rinfold”, etc.
</p>

<h2 id="rindolf_the_dwarf">Rindolf the Dwarven Warrior</h2>

<p>
Rindolf was a dwarven warrior that I played in an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Advanced_Dungeons_.26_Dragons_2nd_edition">AD&amp;D 2nd edition</a> session. I
came up with this name as appropriate for a dwarf probably out of thinking of
other common Germanic names such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randolph_%28given_name%29">Randolph</a>
(literally Shield+Wolf) or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_%28name%29">Rudolph</a> (literally
famous wolf), and it had a nice ring to it. Rindolf ended up becoming my young
favourite tabletop Role playing games character of all time, but then
ended up dying in a battle with a
<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Doppelganger">Doppleganger</a>, in
what was the Broken Shaft’s Adventuring Company best adventure (but a deadly
one), in part due to a misunderstanding between him and the game master. This
death proved to be a big shock on me (= Shlomi), and part of me felt guilty
about the death of my character which I felt was not real enough to warrant
grieving on. I was wrong.
</p>

<p>
Later on, after first using the nickname “dori” and then switching to “gloin”
(= two of the Dwarves from Tolkien’s
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit"><i>The Hobbit</i></a>)
I settled on “rindolf”, which I felt was the most original nickname, and part
of my individuality.
</p>

<h2 id="rindolf_the_evil_reindeer">Rindolf the Evil Reindeer</h2>

<p>
After I started talking intensively on IRC at around 2003 and 2004 (especially
on the <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode network</a>, which I can
still recommend) a few people teased me for being one of Santa Claus’s
red-nosed
reindeer or his “reingeek” or whatever (probably by reference to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer">Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer</a> and his oft-cited brother “Randolph”). At first,
I found it annoying, but after a while decided to take it to my advantage.
</p>

<p>
As a result, the new Rindolf has become the Evil twin brother of
Rudolph and Randolph, the goody-two-shoes Santa’s reindeer, who are among
his arch-enemies. He is also one of the cornerstones of the Evil Reindeer
Evil World Domination Evil Conspiracy, which is aimed to spread Evil in general
and Reindeer Evil in particular around the world.

<h2 id="rindolfism">Rindolfism</h2>

<p>
Rindolfism is my own personal philosophy and idea system, based on many
influences - both more “serious” ones such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29">Ayn
Rand’s Objectivism</a> (I am not a “Randian” mind you, which I no longer find
usable in this day and age),
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism">Judaism</a> (the philosophy
, culture, and idea system, of the Jewish people, which is much more than
just a religion), and the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a>/
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_content">open content</a> movements
- as well as things that don’t take themselves as seriously
as that such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek">the
Star Trek frenchise</a>, the
film
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29"><i>The Princess Bride</i></a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends">the <i>Friends</i> television
show</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_%28TV_series%29">the Buffy frenchise</a>,
and the Greek mythology. These are just some of the major influenences on
Rindolfism, but there are many, many more.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, Rindolfism is not static - it is <b>dynamic</b> and constantly
evolving. Since an early age, I have commited myself to be an idealist, but
my idealism has constantly changed, and my idealism today is very very
different. Furthermore, as great philosophy is (including my own original
or mostly original philosophy), it just provides general guidelines for
behaviour, and a man or a woman eventually should know to use reason and
judgement in leading his life. Making a bad decision and performing a wrong
action, is often better than not doing anything at all.
</p>

<p>
Finally, Rindolfism does not need fans and followers as much as it needs
people who will either:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Criticise it.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Build upon it - including mix and match it with other things.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Suggest improvements.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Try to compete with it.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
I am also not planning to write a complete summary of Rindolfism any time soon,
because like I said, it is constantly evolving, and because I don't see
the point. If interested, you can read <a href="$(ROOT)/philosophy/">my
essays</a> (some of which are somewhat outdated),
<a href="$(ROOT)/humour/">my works of humour and fiction</a> (which are
arguably both more serious, and not as funny as my essays),
<a href="$(ROOT)/me/blogs/">the posts on my blogs</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/shlomif">my Twitter feed</a>, and other Internet
social media outlets where I have posted stuff.

For some attempts at codifying Rindolfism see:

<ul>

<li>
<p>
<a href="$(ROOT)/philosophy/the-eternal-jew/">“The Eternal Jew”</a> - an old
essay, but still mostly pertinent.
</p>

<li>
<p>
<a href="$(ROOT)/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/">“Putting
all the Cards on the Table (2013)”</a> - a newer essay - relevant for 2013,
about which I received mixed opinions, may not be for everyone and that may
require a lot of revamping.
