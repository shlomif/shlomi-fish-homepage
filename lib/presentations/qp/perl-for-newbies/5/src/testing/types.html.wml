Software design methodologists distinguish between several types of
automated tests. First of all, <b>unit tests</b> (also see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">the Wikipedia article</a>)
test only a single "unit" of the code (say a module or a class), to 
see if it behaves as expected. They generaly make sure that the behaviour
of the module is sane and desirable, while not trying to see if it works
as part of the larger scheme.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, <b>system tests</b> test the entire system. For example,
if we're writing code to generate a web-site, we could test that the various
pages of the resultant site contain some of the qualities that we expect.
System tests tests the system as a whole, to see if there'e a bug somewhere.
</p>

<p>
Between unit tests and system tests there could be several intermediate layers
of tests, normally called <b>integration tests</b> .
</p>

<p>
You can write all these tests using TAP, Test::More and other testing
modules on the CPAN, but it's important to be aware of the distinction.
