<p>
There’s a new humorous bit titled <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Copying-Ubuntu-Bug-No-1/" rel="nofollow">“Copying
    Ubuntu Bug No. 1”</a>. It was also
<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/52689.html">featured
    on my tech blog</a> where it received several comments.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Tel Aviv, Israel:</b> “Ubuntu can’t have all the fun only for itself”,
open source distributors are saying as they rush to copy its
<a href="https://launchpad.net/bugs/1" rel="nofollow">Bug No. 1</a> titled “Microsoft has
a majority market share”.
</p>
<p>
Debian, Ubuntu’s parent distribution, has set up
<b>Debian Bug No. 1</b> which also reads “Microsoft has a majority market
share”. Mandriva,
another competing distribution has set up
<a href="https://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1" rel="nofollow">Mandriva
Bug No. 1: “Microsoft has a majority market share and Ubuntu has a majority
market share on the Linux desktop”</a>. Fedora, Gentoo, Archlinux, Slackware
and other distributions are expected to follow suit.

Speaking of Ubuntu, tomorrow it would be 10-October-2010 - 10.10.10 and it
would be the release date of
<a href="http://wiki.ubuntu.com/MaverickMeerkat" rel="nofollow">Ubuntu 10.10
codenamed “Maverick Meerkat”</a>.

There’s
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/humanity/buy-the-fish-in-hebrew.html" rel="nofollow">a new page</a> with a Hebrew translation of the song “Buy the Fish” from
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/humanity/" rel="nofollow">my <i>Humanity - The Movie</i>
    screenplay</a>.

<p>
There are new fortune cookies in
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/" rel="nofollow">the
fortune cookies collection</a> and
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/fortunes-shlomif-all.rss" rel="nofollow">the
RSS feed</a> has now been fixed (the corresponding Atom feed is still broken
due to a bug in the XML::Atom CPAN module).

<p>
Often when I ask the people I train if they know Perl, they tell me “I don’t
know Perl. I can only read it.”. I wonder whether it indicates that Perl is not
a write-only language as some people like to claim.

<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/black-hole-solitaire-solver/" rel="nofollow">The solver for Black Hole solitaire</a> was converted to C, which made
it much faster and less memory-hungry. The results and statistics of running it
on the first 1 million PySolFC Black Hole deals are available in the link.

Many of the code excerpts in the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Newbies/" rel="nofollow">Perl for Newbies

</p>

<p>
The website also now has a better “404” page, and as usual there are many
new links in the various pages. Enjoy!
