<p>
Perl supports inserting variables into string constants simply by
placing their name along with the dollars inside them. Here's an example:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/interpolate1.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
Note that once perl encounters a <tt>$</tt>-sign, it will try to use as
many characters as possible from the string as the variable name,
even if a variable by that name does not exist. Therefore, if you write
<tt>$ab</tt> inside a string, it will not take the value of <tt>$a</tt> and
append the string "b" to it! To overcome this limitation, you can limit the
variable name using curly braces:
<tt>"Hello ${boy}and${girl}"</tt>.
</p>

<p>
In any case, interpolation is especially useful for building regular
expression, since the string may contain control characters.
