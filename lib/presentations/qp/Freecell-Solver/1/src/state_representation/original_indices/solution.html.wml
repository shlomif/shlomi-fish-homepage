<li>
Keep the indices of the stacks and freecells outside the main state
data-structure and sort the two arrays together. (i.e: in a struct that

<li>
The collection considers only the first sizeof(internal) bytes when 
comparing two states.
</li>

<li>
I later used this external information place to store other information like
depth in the search tree, the parent state, etc.
