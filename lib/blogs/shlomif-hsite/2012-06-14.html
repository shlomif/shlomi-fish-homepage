<p>
Here are the recent updates for Shlomi Fish’s Homepage. There are quite a few
changes this time.
</p>

<p>
The humorous document
<a
    href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/It-s-not-a-Fooware-It-s-an-Operating-System/">“It’s
    not a Fooware - it’s an Operating System.”</a>, mostly written
by me, was restored from the perl.net.au wiki which is currently down:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Lots of people heard Emacs haters complain that “Emacs is not an editor - it’s
an operating system” or something along these lines. So here we're trying to
concentrate other such programs that are no longer limited only to their
original purpose, but rather expanded to cover lots of other stuff. So you'll
know that Emacs is not alone.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
I also added a <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#We_agree">a new
    aphorism</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    We agree. But do we agree to agree?
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are some new <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/">Factoids</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If the mountain will not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad will go to the
mountain. If the mountain will not come to Chuck Norris, then the mountain will
suffer Norris’s wrath for not complying with his whims.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And there are also some new 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">fortune cookies</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>

<ul>
<li><b>Su-Shee:</b> SO I TURNED TO YOU FOR HELP IN TIMES OF DESPERATION…</li>

<li><b>Botje:</b> desperation is for wimps</li>

<li><b>anno:</b> prosperation?</li>

<li><b>Altreus:</b> deprecation is an outdated concept and we prefer not to do it</li>

<li><b>Su-Shee:</b> let’s deprecate deprecation.</li>

<li><b>alpha--:</b> agreed.</li>

<li><b>alpha--:</b> oh wait.</li>

<li><b>Su-Shee:</b> that would be a deprecation</li>

<li><b>rindolf:</b> Who will watch the watcher?</li>

<li><b>rindolf:</b> Who will deprecate deprecation?</li>

<li><b>Su-Shee:</b> shouldn’t someone deprecate the deprecator in that case?</li>

<li><i>* rindolf deprecates the deprecator who is deprecating deprecation.</i></li>
<li><b>Altreus:</b> that's OK, it's not deprecated yet</li>
</ul>

I found many typos in the 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Newbies/lecture5/">fifth part 
    of the Perl for Perl Newbies series</a> before and during giving the talk
at the <a href="http://telaviv.pm.org/">Tel Aviv Perl Mongers</a> and also
prepared some notes for it in Hebrew (which can be found in the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Newbies/">series’s front
    page</a>).
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/by-others/perlcast-transcript--tom-limoncelli-interview/">Transcript of the Perlcast interview with
    Tom Limoncelli</a>, about his book <i>Time Management for System
    Administrators</i> has been restored from the currently offline perl.net.au
wiki:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<b>Josh</b>: Getting back to where we had started on that planning your day at
the beginning of the day, before you check your email. You claim there, that
whenever you're prioritising your activities, you really only need three
categories and not, you know, a top-ten list, or anything like that. Could you
explain that a little?
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom Limoncelli</b>: that comes from the fact that I used to try to really be
specific about the priorities of my action items. So I put something in my
to-do-list, and I'd say well, you know I'm ranking their importance from 0 is
not important, and a 100 is the world is going to explode if I don't do it
right now. And I spent so much time calculating "Wow, is this more like a 63 or
a 67, is it a 67? Wow!". And I just spent so much time trying to get an exact
priority. In some cases, the task would have been done already. You know I've
spent too much time prioritising.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure where I picked this up, but someone recommended three priorities:
A - it's due today; B - it's important; and C - everything else. Generally, if
it's a day where I have any A's at all - that's all I'll be working on. And the
way projects go, I'm generally working on that for the whole day. So that's
sort of the exception. Most of the time I'm working on B's, which are things
that are important, and C's are sort of those would-be-nice-kind-of-things.
</p>

<p>
And the nice thing about breaking it into this a simple A, B, C priority scheme
is that first of all, you're spending less time picking your priority. And
secondly, when you're planning your day, in that 5-minute planning period, you
can look at your tasks and say "You know, I wanna work 8 hours today, I have
one hour of meetings, so I'm down to 7 hours", and then you can look at your
tasks and say "Is this more than 7 hours worth of work?". Because it's written,
I can start actually doing this kind of planning, and say "That's more like 14
hours worth of work, so those C priorities and B priorities - I'm gonna move
them to the next day's to-do-list." Or maybe, OK, I have time for my A's and my
B's and the C's get moved.

<p>
The third version of my essay,
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/politics/drug-legalisation/">“The 
    Case for Drug Legalisation”</a>, is now live, with several major
improvements. They are in large part, thanks to someone who commented on my 
essay, and allowed me to use their text, and who chose to remain anonymous.
</p>

<p>
I have set up project pages for 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/mikmod/">MikMod, a 
    module files player</a>, which I now maintain, and for
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/website-meta-language/">Website
    META Language</a>, a sophisticated HTML preprocessor, which I have also 
been maintaining and recently released its 2.2.0 version.
</p>

<p>
Also in the software section is a 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/how-to-contribute-to-my-projects/">How 
    to Contribute to my Projects</a> sub-section with a concentrated and
ongoing “HACKING” document.
</p>

<p>
And, naturally, there are also many smaller enhancements, such as new links,
fixes for broken links, new <tt>&lt;meta name="description" /&gt;</tt>
tags, and corrections of typos. I’ve also moved the site’s version control 
repository from a Subversion repository that required a username and password
to access to a 
<a href="http://bitbucket.org/shlomif/shlomi-fish-homepage">publicly-accessible
Mercurial repository</a>. More details can be found on
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/site-source/">the Site's Source Code
page</a>.
