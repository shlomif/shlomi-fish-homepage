<h2 id="no-accesskey"><a href="no-accesskey.user.js">Eliminate
Access Keys</a></h2>

<p>
What this script does is remove access keys from all the elements of the
page. This is relevant to sites such as
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">the Wikipedia</a> that trap many commonly
used shortcuts (like Alt+F, Alt+E).
</p>

<p>
Note that because of
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=290801">a
bug in Mozilla</a> it cannot cancel accesskeys assigned to &lt;input /&gt;
boxes. It would be able to do so once the bug is fixed.
</p>

<h2 id="self-links-for-headers"><a href="self-links-for-headers-with-ids.user.js">Self links for Headers with id="" attributes</a></h2>

<p>
It is a good practice to provide id="" attributes (which can serve as anchors)
for <tt>&lt;h2&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;h3&gt;</tt>, etc. headers. What this script
does is create self-links after the headers so one can use them to either jump
to the page, or link directly to the portion in the page.
</p>

<h2 id="svn-links-to-repos"><a href="svn-links-to-repos.user.js">Subversion
Links to the Repository</a></h2>

<p>
This script creates links from the ViewVC browser back to the Subversion
repositories, so they can be accessed using the svn command line client.
</p>

<p>
So far it works on <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/">BerliOS</a>’s
ViewVC and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> ones,
but support for more can be added.
</p>

<h2 id="eliminate-from-rss"><a href="get-rid-of-from-rss.user.js">Get Rid
of “from=rss” in the URL</a></h2>

<p>
I am always annoyed that when I follow links in the RSS feeds of
<a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> or other Slash-based sites,
I’m getting a “?from=rss” or “&amp;from=rss” CGI parameter at the URL.
This later implies more work for me when I want to link to them.
</p>

<p>
So what this incredibly silly script does is redirect to a new page without
this suffix.
</p>

<h2 id="qa-mandriva-fix-anchor"><a
href="qa.mandriva.com-fix-reply-to-anchor.user.js">Fix the qa.mandriva.com
reply-to-comment anchor</a></h2>

<p>
The Mandriva Bugzilla
(qa.mandriva.com) had a bug where replying to a comment jumps to the first
comment instead of the reply-to-box. This greasemonkey script fixed this
problem.
</p>

<h2 id="freshmeat-expand-desc"><a
href="freshmeat-expand-descriptions.user.js">Expand the Freecode Descriptions</a></h2>

<p>
This script is meant to expand the descriptions of
<a href="http://freecode.com/">Freecode (formerly known as Freshmeat.net)</a>
which are truncated by
default. It was written by inspiration from
<a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/51522">this script</a>, but
actually works, because the latter does not work due to what appears to be
bad timing in the JS application.
</p>

<h2 id="o-and-m-title"><a href="ozy-millie-title.user.js">Ozy and Millie
Title Generator</a></h2>

<p>
This script is intended for a specialised purpose, and doesn’t add to the
user experience, so I didn’t put it on userscripts.org. What this script does
is generate an entry with basic information that can be used for my
MediaWiki-based transcription of the
<a href="http://www.ozyandmillie.org/">Ozy and Millie</a> cartoons on each
page of the cartoon. That way one can copy and paste it instead of entering
it manually.
</p>

<p>
This script is useful for people doing transcription of Ozy and Millie,
but otherwise should not be used.
</p>

<h2 id="o-and-m-mediawiki-edit-transcripts"><a
href="mediawiki-edit-ozy-and-millie-transcripts.user.js">Ozy
and Millie MediaWiki Transcribing Aid</a></h2>

<p>
I’m using MediaWiki to prepare a transcript for the <i>Ozy and Millie</i>
comics. This script does auto-completion for several addresses by the
common characters based on their first letters.
</p>

<p>
So, for example “*Oz” Becomes “* '''Ozy''': ”, and “**Ms” becomes
“** '''Ms. Mudd'''”. There’s a complete list of mappings in the
“var ids_to_fullnames” mapping in the file.
</p>

<p>
Since this script is also intended for a specialised purpose, I haven’t
uploaded it to userscripts.org either.
