<define-tag facts__xena>
<p>
After reading the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Norris_facts">Wikipedia
page about Chuck Norris Facts</a> (and related facts), I was saddened to learn
that there were none about females. So, in the name of gender equality,
I have decided to start a collection of facts about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xena">Xena, the Warrior Princess</a>.
I recall watching the show and enjoying it, though I found it a little silly.
I also found the character of Xena to be more comical than strong.
</p>

<p>
In any case, I have some ideas for funny factoids about Xena, so it would be
a start. All additions are welcome.

<define-tag facts__xslt>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSL_Transformations">XSLT</a> is
short for Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) Transformations and is
an XML-based language for transforming XML documents into other XML
documents.
</p>

<p>
These facts illustrate how <b>evil</b> XSLT (supposedly) is. I think XSLT
has many legitimate uses and can be pretty sweet, but
<a href="$(ROOT)/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-sharp-programming-why-XSLT-is-so-evil">an
IRC conversation we had on ##programming</a> started this meme and it
seems cool.
