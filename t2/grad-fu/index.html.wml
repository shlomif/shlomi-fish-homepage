<latemp_subject "Gradient-Fu Patch for the GIMP" />
<latemp_meta_desc "Patch for old versions of the GIMP to be able to perform gradient operations from within scripts and plug-ins." />

<h2>Recent Note</h2>

<p>
The Gradient-Fu functionality was integrated into GIMP 2.2.0 and above. This
page will remain here in case one is interested in versions of this patch for
older GIMP versions.
</p>

<h2>About the Patch</h2>

<p>
This is a patch that exposes the functionality of the gradient editor to
scripts and plug-ins by putting gradient-editing routines inside GIMP’s
procedural database.

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>
According to what I read in an interview with one of the GIMP’s developers,
better gradient support is planned for GIMP 1.4 or GIMP 2.0. So I guess a
functionality similar to what this patch offers will be available.
