<p>
It’s been about two weeks since my last update, and here’s what’s new:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/art/recommendations/music/">A currently
        partial list</a> of my favourite compact discs is now live. Creating
    this list involved a large amount of 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Definition">DTD</a>,
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</a>, <a href="http://perl-begin.org/">Perl</a>, and CSS hacking on the 
    <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Grammar-ProductsSyndication/">XML-Grammar-ProductsSyndication</a> 
    framework, that was written from scratch to facilitate making construction 
    of such lists possible by and others. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I will add the missing CDs as time goes by, and will also later on add
    lists for fiction books and for movies, as well as convert the existing
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/books-recommends/">non-fiction
        books recommendations</a> into the new framework.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    More pages on the site were made to validate according to the 
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/">World-wide-web consortium</a> standards, and
    some ancient leftovers that were no longer important were removed.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/favourite/">My list of 
        favourite open source software</a> was updated, with many corrections, 
    added programs and a new navigation menu.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/prog-evolution/pre-elpas.html">My memoirs
        as a programmer from High School</a> were heavily fixed and updated.
