<h1>Using Transactions</h1>
<h3>* A transaction is a batch of statements that is executed at
once or can be cancelled altogether.<br />
<br />
* Use "BEGIN" to start a transaction. After the transaction is done
use "COMMIT" to execute it, or "ROLLBACK" to cancel it.<br />
<br />
* Example:<br />
<br /></h3>
<pre>
test=&gt; BEGIN \g
BEGIN
test=&gt; UPDATE employees SET first_name = 'Nahum' WHERE employee_id = 3 \g
UPDATE 1
test=&gt; INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name)
test=&gt; VALUES (500, 'Linus', 'Torvalds' ) \g
INSERT 18680 1
test=&gt; DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 54 \g
DELETE 1
test=&gt; COMMIT \g
END


</pre>
<h3>* Changes that are made during the transaction are visible to
queries within the transaction. Yet, they only become visible to
the outside world, after the transaction was committed.<br /></h3>
