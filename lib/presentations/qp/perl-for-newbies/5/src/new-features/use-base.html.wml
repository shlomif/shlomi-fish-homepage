<p>
The <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/base.html">use base</a> pragma allows
one to conveniently set the base packages of an object, while loading their
corresponding modules at the same time. Using it is preferable to
fiddling with <tt>@ISA</tt> directly.
</p>

<p>
Note that if you are using Moose, you should use the <tt>extends()</tt>
function instead of <tt>use base</tt>.

<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/parent/">The parent pragama</a>
forked from base.pm to "remove the cruft that accumulated there". It may
be prefarable.
