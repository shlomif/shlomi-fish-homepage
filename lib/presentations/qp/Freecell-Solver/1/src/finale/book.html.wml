I plan to write a book about the development of Freecell Solver. This book
will cover many more changes that I put into the program, and will cover
everything in greater detail.

The book would be made available on-line at the time of its publishing. If you
represent a publishing house and would be interested in publishing it,
please <a href="mailto:shlomif@iglu.org.il">contact me</a>.
