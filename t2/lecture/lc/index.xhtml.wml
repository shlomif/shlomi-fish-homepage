<p>
<a href="$(ROOT)/lecture/Lambda-Calculus/">These slides</a> introduce the
reader to the <a href="http://www.schemers.org/">Scheme programming
language</a>, which is a relatively minimalistic dialect of LISP. It then
uses it to teach about Lambda Calculus, which is a minimalistic
Turing-complete environment with only two primitives, but one that is still
quite usable.
