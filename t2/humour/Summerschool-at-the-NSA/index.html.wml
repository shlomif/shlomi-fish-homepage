<latemp_subject "Summerschool at the NSA - A Screenplay" />

<summerschool_at_the_nsa_common_top_elems />

<p>
This informal screenplay (which was not produced or filmed yet) is surrealist
realism, and takes place in the spring-summer of 2013. It is far-fetched, but
could actually happen.

Classical Randianism as unfitting for 2013 and forward, and
