Happy <a href="http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,25642,23880365-5014239,00.html">Firefox
    3 Release Day</a> everyone. Hope you enjoy the new browser, which
I can <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/11712.html">highly
    recommend</a>. Here’s a
new edition of the “What’s new in Shlomi Fish’s home-site” log.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#pedantic_people">A new joke</a>
has been added to the aphorisms page: (by a friend of mine)
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    I often wonder why I hang out with so many people who are so pedantic. And
    then I remember - because they are so pedantic.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/art/recommendations/music/">Music
    Recommendations page</a> was updated with more links (to the Wikipedia,
etc.) and with a new CD (The Lion King). Moreover,
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/books-recommends/">The
    Non-fiction books’ recommendations page</a> was updated with new books.
And lastly, I began working
on <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/recommendations/films/">a
    page with recommendations of films</a>.
</p>

<p>
More text has been added to
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">Star
    Trek: “We, the Living Dead”</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[Jadzia is walking towards Quark’s bar and sees quark standing next to a
terminal and mumbling.]
</p>

<p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> Hi Quark! Why are you so happy?</p>

<p><strong class="sayer">Quark:</strong> Remember the film I took? Rom helped
me edit it, and I’ve been distributing and selling it online. I have made a
fortune.</p>

<p>[Camera zooms to reveal Brunt in the background.]</p>

<p><strong class="sayer">Brunt:</strong> Brunt, FCA.</p>

<p><strong class="sayer">Quark:</strong> I made a fortune.</p>

<p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> You <strong class="bold">had</strong> made a fortune.</p>

<p><strong class="sayer">Quark:</strong> Yep.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">quotations in the
    fortune cookies collection</a> were greatly enhanced: new quotes were
added, the plaintext files are now synchronised from the new XML sources,
and more meta-data and styles have been added.
</p>

<p>
Added the <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Vim/telux-tips-and-tricks/">summary
    page of the recent Tel Aviv Linux club Vim Tips+Tricks meeting</a>.
</p>

<p>
I placed <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/by-others/mashhoor--10-reasons--hebrew.html">the
    Hebrew translation</a> I prepared of
<a href="http://www.webinmind.net/2006/06/16/10-reasons-for-companies-to-consider-web-standards/">Mashhoor
    Al Dubayan’s “10 Reasons for Companies to Consider Web Standards”</a> on
my homepage.
</p>

<p>
The specification for the old
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/rindolf/">“Rindolf - a Perl Dialect”</a>
was integrated into the flow of the site.
</p>

<p>
I made sure the Hebrew on the pages will be recognised as Hebrew by Firefox
and other browsers (added the lang attribute, etc.).
