            <p>A Jewish Deduction</p>

            <p>
The Bible dictates that "Thou shalt not seethe [= cook] a kid [= young goat]
in his mother's milk." To avoid any possibility of breaking that regulation, 
the Jewish tradition ruled that it also applies to female goats, to mature
goats, and to the meat and milk of two completely unrelated goats. It is 
also forbidden to eat the meat with fresh milk, and it applies to beef 
and mutten as well (including mixing the milk and meat of two different
beasts). Finally, chicken, which are incapable of milk production, may not
be eaten along with any mammal's milk either. 
</p>

<p>
We are fortunate that most mathematicians were not Jewish. Otherwise, it
would have been forbidden to divide by all numbers between -1 and 1.

Sure I did. I sat at one point of an IRC channel, and someone
tested me. Eventually it was discovered that I am a computer, but it
turned out the other side was an Eliza program. Strangely enough, I could
not detect that the latter fact was true.

Judging by IRC or AOL, randomly would do just fine ;-)

            And thank you for applying this patch. But to be honest, I'm a little
disappointed. I expected it won't go in so easily and will trigger some
discussion here. But there was none. No typo corrections ("you mis-spelled
'floccinaucinihilipilification'"); no flames ("this patch is the worst
thing since non-sliced bread"). Nothing.</p>

<p>
Someone should do something about it. This direction is not healthy for
p5p. Seriously.</p>

Are you kidding?

CVS is not advanced as:

1. Microsoft Visual SourceSafe - the only sane choice for good data integrity 
and portability.

2. tarballs/zip-files and patches. This one excels in convenience, and 
robustness.

CVS is a very advanced version control system, however. I do wish that 
Subversion (which is a VCS that I have to use against my will) was as good as 
it is.

      </meta>
      <quote><body><p>A few weeks ago, I've been to Freenode's #perl, talking to merlyn and other
guys, when we got to discuss the Biblical "Tower of Babel Myth". As it turned
out, the commonly perceived interpretation was not the one most scholars find
as more sensible, which is the one we ended up being taught at Junior High
School. </p><p>What most people think is something like that: </p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
The people spoke to each other in the same language, concentrated in one place,
and decided to build a tower high enough so they can reach God. God, a small
dwarf who lived in the sky, was afraid of the efforts of these people, because
he feared they'll reach him. So he casted an 8th level Spell of Language
Fragmentation, caused these people to speak in different tongues, and without
being able to understand each other, they ended up spreading across the Earth.
God was relieved and returned to his dwarfish deeds, as dwarfs do.

          <text><![CDATA[> This reminds me of Paul Graham's articles, in which he claims that LISP
> programmers are better. But why is it so (whether or not you agree to

No. 1 is true, naturally. No. 2 is not true - I know LISP but I prefer Perl. 
Other like Python, etc. The reasons I don't prefer LISP are:

1. The standards of Common LISP and Scheme don't define anything practical.
2. LISP is at the moment incredibly verbose.
3. As Larry Wall noted, all LISP code comes in parenthesis and so it all looks 
the same. (Perl is the exact opposite in this regard).
4. I cannot make heads nor tails of serious LISP code. Many LISPers create so 
many macros and use them along with regular LISP code, so you keep having to 
refer to the previous definitions, and make a lot of research to get you 
started.

SICP Scheme is easy and fun. But serious LISP code can take too much time to 
understand. OTOH, recently I had little problem reading the source code of 
other Perl programmers, and extending it or fixing bugs. (likewise for 
Python).

problem I have with KMail at work, where I cannot start KAddressBook from
inside it. I asked my question and soon afterwards received:</p>

<!-- TODO: Convert to <ol /> and <li /> -->
<p>* One Thunderbird recommendation.<br />
* Two Evolution recommendations.<br />
* One Sylpheed Claws recommendation.<br />
* One GMail recommendation.</p>

<p>The problem is that I wasn't interested to learn about alternative E-mail
clients, and just wanted to get my problem solved. And in GMail's case it was
completely out of the question due to my work's constraints. </p><p>    -- Shlomi Fish in

      <quote><body><p>RTFM vs. JATFM 
--------------</p><p>I recently had to figure out how to do something with wget: get everything
below a directory on the web-server, without following links to outside it. So
I logged in to FreeNode's #debian channel, where there are many knowledgable
people to ask it. The first answer I got was "RTFM". So, I read the wget man
page, but could not find it there. Eventually, after telling people that it
would be faster to give an answer, I got a reply ( add the -np -r flags). But
this has been the last straw. </p><p>I composed my own acronym. Just like RTFM is "Read the Fabulous Manual" and
STFW is "Search the Fabulous Web", then JATFM is "Just Answer the Fabulous
Man". It means that it's usually faster to answer someone's question than to
ask him to RTFM, which is just going to annoy him. I think the RTFM mantra has
done a lot of damage in the UNIX/Linux world, and I hope JATFMing would prove
to be a more healthy ideology. </p><p>    -- Shlomi Fish in

I don't suppose we should propose that as an alternative to Perl Gods, there 
should at least be Perl Saints:

http://www.stallman.org/saint.html

Of course, I'm not sure what being a Perl saint would imply. Using nothing but 
Perl? (Including not C in which perl 5 is written?)

Oh well.

Not that I mind the Perl Gods stereotype stuff.

Regards,

        Shlomi Fish (a Perl saint^W hero wannabe, but definitely 
        not a Perl God)

I almost feel honor bound now to start a noise band called The Randal
Schwartz Condition.  I could shout his rants into a microphone while
the rest of the band flogged a newbie live on stage.

<p>
A: You Linux kids are so lucky. When we were using Windows 95 and Windows 3.11 
it kept getting stuck and we lost all our data. We had to reboot it.
</p>

<p>
B: You used Windows 95! Lucky Bastard! When I was your age, we used DOS on CGA 
screens, and we were lucky if we had 4 colors, much less a true windowing 
environment.
</p>

<p>
C: You had DOS with graphics? Lucky bastard! When I was your age, I used 
VT-100 terminals connected to a VAX. 128 characters should be enough for 
everybody?
</p>

<p>
D: Visual Terminals? When I was your age, we used teletypes on a PDP-11: the 
computer printed on paper - very slowly. Can you imagine cat'ing a really 
long document?
</p>

<p>
E: Teletypes were heaven compared to the punch cards that I was using. Imagine 
going over to the computer with a large amount of punch cards and then 
dropping them all.
</p>

<p>
F: Punch cards! What is this talk about punch cards? We inputted machine code 
direclty using buttons and LEDs.
</p>

<p>
G: And all <b>we</b> had were NAND gates!
</p>

<p>
&lt;/monty-python&gt;

<saying who="ne2k__">yrlnry: not that it has anything to do with perl, but the &lt;input&gt; tag in HTML has both &quot;name&quot; and &quot;value&quot; attributes. the value is what gets shown in the browser typically.</saying>
<saying who="yrlnry">ne2k__: yes, and the value is also what is submitted when someone presses the button, but I want the displayed label to be different from what it submitted, as it is say with &lt;option ...&gt;</saying>

            <p>
                Richard M. Stallman (RMS) decides to release his brand-new
                editor, "Emacs" on the CPAN with its first version 29.999.99.
                In order to package it, he invokes the trusty ol'
                module-starter (see http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Starter/
                ) which creates a skeleton of a CPAN distribution for him.
            </p>

            <p> 
                He fills in the skeleton with the actual code of Emacs, types
                "perl Build.PL", and "./Build test" and makes sure all the
                tests pass. Then he types "./Build config --gui" and gets a
                nice GUI to configure the various parameters of the Module
                meta-data.[M-B-Data]
            </p>

            <p> 
                In the GUI, Richard goes to the Trove categorisation tab, and
                selects categories. This is done in a similar way to
                Freshmeat's project categorisation dialog (a list of options to
                the left, with selected options to the right and arrows to move
                them left or right, while allowing multiple select options.).
                He chooses such categories as "Programming Language :: Lisp",
                and "Intended Audience :: Emacs Users", "Operating System ::
                GNU", and "Topic :: Editors". (Note: I believe the category
                list should be fetched using a public web-service to keep them
                up-to-date.)

            <p>
                After several weeks of having the editor on CPAN, Richard has
                received many patches, and wrote a lot of code on his own. Now
                Emacs is not only an editor but a calendar tool, an Eliza
                program, a web browser, a mail user agent and many other
                things.
            </p>

            <p> 
                So in order to release version 30.000.00 he needs to update the
                categorisation.  He runs ./Build config --gui again, and adds
                more categories. However, he enters too many categories
                (because Emacs now does them all), and the GUI refuses  to save
                the file because it will overflow the limit that the
                web-service specified the CPAN classification services allow to
                handle. So Richard keeps only the important categories, adds
                more tags, and saves it.
            </p>

            <p>
                He then tests the distribution again, and uploads the new
                distribution to the CPAN.

            <p>
Bill Gates, CEO of Microsoft decides to use Richard Stallman's Emacs as the
basis of his company's state-of-the-art product Microsoft Editing Macrosâ„¢ 
Enterprise Edition XP .NET Professional. However since MS Editing Macrosâ„¢ is 
a commercial, proprietary program which he intends to sell at computer stores, 
Bill is not going to upload it to the CPAN. He builds upon Emacs, sends 
patches to  Richard and learns a lot about it.
</p>

<p>
When he's finished building Microsoft Editing Macrosâ„¢ he surfs to the
Emacs homepage on CPAN, and adds some categories and tags of his own.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, enough people like Bill tag and categorise Emacs, and it gains
more classification.

              <p> Well, it's not a threat - it's a warning, and he won't be
                  harmed much by acting against my advice. A threat is
                  something like "Stop posting political posts or I will burn
                  your house, rape your wife and daughters, banish you to the
                  middle of Antarctica, convert all your Perl code to PHP, and
                  then post it on thedailywtf.com." 
              </p>

              <p> Regarding what you say that "no one cares if you
                  unsubscribe", then this reminds me of what Fred Brooks says
                  in "The Mythical Man-Month": "How does a project becomes
                  late? One day at a time.". If you're not careful, you might 
                  lose a large percent of your blog's readership, one 
                  subscriber at a time.

              <p>1) did you use the correct argument order? if you're a good programmer, use the *reverse* from what you think it is. see if it works. no? you're not a good programmer, or you learned php's braindeadness and can go on to step 2).</p>
              <p>
                  2) did you think about your code? if so, don't. php will do it for you so you can do mindbogglingly stupid stuff, such as not escape the data that goes into your sql queries.

<saying who="Makoryu">(A vim clone in Perl)</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">good question. there&#39;s one in javascript :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: actually , it&#39;s a vi clone.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Writing a vi clone is much easier than writing a vim clone.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Just like writing a Scheme clone is much easier than writing a Perl 6 implementation.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Unless you&#39;re Chuck Norris.</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">rindolf: darn.. he already wrote a vim in perl6?</saying>
<saying who="moritz_">no, he scared K&amp;R into writing it ;-)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: Chuck Norris is the ghost author of the entire Debian GNU/Linux distribution.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: and he wrote it in 24 hours, while taking snack breaks.</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">rindolf: yes, I know - he published slackware under the pseudonym patrick volkerding...</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Chuck Norris read the entire Wikipedia. Twice.</saying>
<saying who="araujo">the second time includes fixing all its errors</saying>
<saying who="moritz_">but he didn&#39;t commmit his changes, it seems</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">moritz_: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">LOL.</saying>
<saying who="araujo">Chuck Norris doesn&#39;t commit changes, the changes commit for him</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Code is too scared of Chuck to be wrong.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">It is generated right in the first time.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Bugs are too afraid to reproduce on Chuck Norris&#39; computer.</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">.o(I see a chuck norris release on the horizon... ;)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: :-)</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">we could ask chuck norris if he&#39;s willing to promote the star release.. ;)) (which probably kill the entire internet due to laughter.. :)</saying>
<saying who="araujo">Perl 6 - A Chuck Norris like language</saying>
<saying who="dukeleto">Chuck Norris has actually been using Perl 6 since 1987, and has been waiting for Larry to play catch-up. :)</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Perl 6 - Kicks ass like Chuck.</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">rakudo - chuck&#39;s choice ;)</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">well, camelia and chuck norris go well together. ;)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Of course everybody know Chuck Norris is a real programmer. </saying>
<saying who="rindolf">He designs machines by combining individual atoms.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Using his thought.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: MPD is when there are several personalities living inside your brain.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: in schizophrenia, you have one I-ness, but hear voices, hallucinate and stuff.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">rindolf: Ah. Why is it considered a disorder? MPD could be quite useful... One would have different perspectives on a subject.</saying>

<saying who="dabreegster">Wait, I do have the Voices. Maybe I have MPD _and_ schizophrenia.</saying>
<saying who="b0at">Ah, but the question is: do the Voices have voices?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Consciousness_in_the_Breakdown_of_the_Bicameral_Mind</saying>
<saying who="b0at">And if so, is it your own voice?</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">b0at: And do the voices of the voices have voices?</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: http://fc-solve.berlios.de/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: I am not solvable.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I am Turing hard.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">:S</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">never heard of anything called &#39;turing hard&#39;</me_is>
<saying who="joeyadams">lol.  Zuu&#39;s probabilistic, so maybe he can solve you.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">but i guess i have now</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Formal definition of Turing hard:  blah blah blah hard blah blah Turing blah.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">Hahahaha :D</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Wikipedia:   Given a set X in P(N), a set A in N is called Turing hard for X if X &lt;=_T A for all X in X. If additionally A is in X, then A is called Turing complete for X.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Does that clarify?</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_reduction for the actual math symbols)</saying>
<me_is who="joeyadams">assumes you get the point</me_is>
<saying who="Zuu">yeah, i think i&#39;ll have to put significant time into that, for me to comprehend it :)</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">but maybe i will, some day :P</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">My point is that people like to use mumbo jumbo to describe more concise mumbo jumbo.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">E.g. A problem is NP-hard if it is at least as hard as all the problems in NP.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">i undersstand enough of it, to be fairly confident that rindolf being turing hard, will not say much about his ability to be solved</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">I&#39;m guessing Turing-hard means you can&#39;t solve a problem with a Turing machine (e.g. the halting problem)</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">(substitute Turing machine with &quot;your computer&quot; :) )</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">no, turing hard has something to do with expressiveness</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">okay, Zuu &gt; joeyadams, so I can&#39;t help you :)</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">tickles joeyadams ^^</me_is>
<saying who="joeyadams">A delicious apple is any fruit âˆˆ apple that is at least as tasty as any other fruit âˆˆ apple.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">In other words, apples are in the set of recursively nommable fruits.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">joeyadams: what&#39;s up?</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">I&#39;m babbling.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">joeyadams: Apple is one of my least favourite fruits.</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">watches a number of apples that recursively NOM&#39;s eathother</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">It tends to be too commonplace.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Or simpleton.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">whoops, my logic is incorrect</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Only delicious apples are âˆˆ the nommable fruits.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">(recursively is just a word you throw in to sound smart)</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">NOMs joeyadams :&gt;</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">joeyadams: a friend of one of my sisters said that Apple is his favourite fruit.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Ta-zuu!</saying>
<me_is who="joeyadams">has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection nommed by peer))</me_is>
<saying who="Zuu">yeah, unfortunately a lot of people throw with a lot of words to sound smart :/</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">my favourite fruit is a recursive banana!</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">although it certainly helps to use complex terminology to solve complex problems.  As Aristophanes said, &quot;High thoughts must have high language.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">.. along with immutable polymorphic pears</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Zuu&gt; I guess you have to peel it indefinitely?</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">lol</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">Hahah, yeah :P</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">I tend to eat bananas in deterministic polynomial time.</saying>

<saying who="whoppix">Quick git question, perhaps someone knows the answer: I have a file in my git tree (locally and in the repository), but I want git to ignore the file completely, i.e. git is not to touch the file on the filesystem by updating it or merging local changes into the repostiroy</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whoppix: you can use .gitignore</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I think</saying>
<saying who="whoppix">rindolf, hmm, good idea, thanks.</saying>
<saying who="whoppix">that was slow.</saying>
<saying who="whoppix">rindolf, hm, I think git update-index --assume-unchanged is what I need.</saying>
<saying who="whoppix">.gitignore is only for untracked files</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">whoppix: OK, have no clue what that is.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Git is so complicated.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And so opaque</saying>
<saying who="whoppix">rindolf, me neither, but the doc tells me to use that.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Though I need to add that part.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Let me do it now.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">whatever webserver you use, it doesnt provide the right mimetype... At least IE 8 dont attempt to render the document</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: you cannot using IE 8</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: you need Firefox.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: it&#39;s application/xml+xhtml</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Or Opera.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">well, it indeed is the right mimetype... stupid IE</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">well, my FF crashed, so i just use IE when that happens</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">FF crashed?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">How strange.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Maybe you have a bad plugin.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">It does that around 6 times a day</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Not an extension - a plugin.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Ah, really.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Something is wrong in the Zuuniverse.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Or Zuumputer.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">nah, i suspect one of the tabs are just doing some strange stuff</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">memory leaking javascript ro something like that</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">it is kinda starting to annoy me</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">but with 90 - 120 tabs, it would take quite a while to find out what tab it is</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">you might consider starting your articles, or whatever this is, with an introduction telling what it&#39;s about</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Blue-Rabbit-Log/ideas.xhtml#the-angry-demon</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: it&#39;s not an article - these are random ideas for a screenplay.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: but I&#39;ll write an intro.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">start the page with &quot;Here are some of my random ideas for a screen play im writing:&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">at LEAST!</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">you cant just jump right into something without giving _any_ indication ow what the reader can expect</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">it simply doesnt make any sense as it is now</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">you could just as well have posted a log of ljuwidah talking :P</saying>
