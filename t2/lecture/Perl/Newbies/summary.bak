Intro
    Capabilities of the language: Regexs, OOP, FP, unlimited data structures,
    The perl cycle - write -> run -> debug -> correct -> run
    "There is no king's road to mathematics", Euclid
Output
    The print command.
    Note about semi-colons
Expressions
    Basic operators : +, -, /, *, ( ... ), ., %, **
    Note about using parenthesis with the print function
Strings ( " ... " )
    Basic Escape Sequences - \$ \" \\ \n
    The length() function
    The substr() function
    The int() function
    Note about converting numbers to strings and vice versa (you don't need to!)
Variables
    Introduction to the concept of variables
    A scalar variable can hold anything
    Assigning a value to a variable
        Note about the "+=", "*=", "++" operators
    Getting the value of a variable.
    Note: the dollars are used both for lvalues and rvalues.
    Simple Examples: $a = "Hello world!\n"; print $a,$a,$a;
Input
    The <> operator.
    Examples:
    print "Please enter your name:\n";
        $name = <>;
        print ("Hello " . $name . "!\n");
The For Loop
    The for loop: for $i (1..100)
    Examples:
    Renaming h00.jpg to h000.jpg h01.jpg to h001.jpg etc.
    Printing the multiplication board.
Conditionals:
    if .. elsif .. elsif .. else
    Examples:
        Testing if an inputted name starts with a.
Condition Expressions:
    The numeric comparison operators
    The string comparison operators
    The && and || operators
The While Loop
    Explanation
    Examples:
        ##################################
        print "Input a number:\n";
        $number=<>;
        my $power_of_2 = 1;
        while ($power_of_2 < $number)
        {
            $power_of_2 = ($power_of_2*$power_of_2);
        }
        print ("The first power of 2 that is " .
            "greater than this number is " , $power_of_2, "\n");
        ##################################
Arrays:
    Syntax: @array, $array[$index], scalar(@array).
    The , operator.
    foreach
        Note about the fact that the for and foreach keywords are equivalent
        Note about the .. operator (without too much explanation)
