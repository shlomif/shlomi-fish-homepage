<h1 class="fcs">7 Regular Expressions</h1>

<p>
Regular expressions are one of the most powerful features of perl, but are
also one of the most difficult to understand. Don't let that fact discourage
you: they are definitely worth your time.
</p>

<p>
Basically, a regular expression tells the interpreter to search a string
for a pattern. The pattern can be a simple one like the word "hello" or a
complex one, such as the word "hello" followed by as many instances of the
word "one" as possible, followed by the word "triple". The latter will be 
written as <tt>hello(one)*triple</tt> inside a regular expression.
</p>

<p>
The perl operators allow you to do three things with a regular expression: 
</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>
Check if it exists in the string at all.
</li>
<li>
Retrieve all of its occurences.
</li>
<li>
Substitue the first occurence or all of its occurences with some other string
or (perl) expression.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Some perl functions such as <tt>split</tt> and <tt>grep</tt> (which will be
covered later) can utilize regular expressions to do other tasks.
