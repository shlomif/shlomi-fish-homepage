                        I've been a fan of some of Shania Twain's MTv hits, and
                        downloaded them from Peer-to-Peer networks. One day
                        when I went to a local store looking for certain CDs, 
                        I saw her "Greatest Hits" compilation. Since I was
                        looking for other CDs, I did not buy it then, but
                        rather went another day and bought Twain's CD.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The CD did not disappoint me. With some great songs like
                        "Up", "Come on over", "Man, I feel like a woman!", 
                        "Any man of mine", "Party for Two", and my old
                        favourites "That don't impress me much", "You're Still
                        the One", and "I'm Gonna Getcha" - this CD is one of
                        my favourites. Shania Twain sings her country, (perhaps
                        pop country) songs in a fun way, and the arrangement is
                        very nice.

                        On the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) someone jokingly
                        said that the empty set is defined as the people who
                        like both Shania Twain and Pink Floyd. So I guess I
                        belong to the empty set.

                        is a wonderful composer and singer. Her
                        atmosphoric music (often accompanied by her vocals) is 
                        stimulating and exciting. This is a CD that aims to be
                        her best, and it does contain many wonderful tracks: 
                        "The Celts" (the opening titles of the documentary
                        show), "Book of Days", "Orinoco Flow", "Carribean
                        Blue" and many other of my favourites. Highly
                        recommended.

                        school. I grew to like several of its songs. Ace of
                        Base have interesting beats, the singers have good
                        voices and the Dance/Pop/Rock arrangement is pleasant
                        to listen to.

                        Bond are a string quartet made out of four hot chicks,
                        who are doing lots of nice crossover classical music.
                        Being a fan of crossover classic and having heard some
                        of Bond's song, I went to the records store determined
                        to find a Bond song. I found this album, which is
                        very nice.

                        The Movie Dirty Dancing featured a lot of great music,

                        from the movie makes for a great listening. With some
                        old hits and completely new recordings, this CD is a
                        must have.

                        The Arizona Dream Soundtrack is tantalising and
                        moving, with some great tracks. Goran Bregovic seems
                        very talented, and Iggy Pop does the vocals very
                        well. The music is a combination of ethnic Balkan music,
                        with some modern arrangements, and is excellent.

                        6.0 and we received it as a gift. This album has some 
                        very nice mostly instrumental tracks, in a "New 
                        Age"-like style. The music in this CD is very moving,
                        and is inspired by many different genres of music.
