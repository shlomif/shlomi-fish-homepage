<latemp_meta_desc "Various artwork by Shlomi Fish: computer graphics, some photographs, and some music" />

<p>
I dedicate this section to the various pieces of computer graphics I designed
, photographs I took and published here, and computerised music which I
created. I will explain how I created the graphic art, so you can
shamelessly duplicate my efforts and create similar art.

I’m not much of a photographer, but I still enjoy taking photographs using
my digital camera, and putting them online under a permissive licence to
enrich the commons. Most of the photos I took are now
