<latemp_subject "The Pope Died on Sunday" />

<p>
An insane week in the life of an American female graphic artist named Rachel
Southern. A typical Hollywoodian story with not-so-common elements. Currently,
only a Hebrew version is available. 
</p>

<p>
This story is work in progress, so stay tuned and I'll write it as time goes
by. Send your comments by E-mail to

<b>Note for 3-April-2005:</b> This story is unrelated to the recent 
death of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II">Pope John 
Paul II</a>. I wrote most of what you can find here several years ago 
. Here's <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/676">my 
first announcement of its writing</a>. It's also not finished yet.

<p>
After a long time of almost complete neglect, I did some serious work on the 
story. Many parts were seriously revamped, and new parts were added. Some of
the bits at the end were connected together.
</p>

<p>
Due to the change of the primary working environment (from Windows to Linux and
from Microsoft Word to OpenOffice.org),  there is now a change of available 
formats. The drafts are now available in 
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> .SXW, HTML, and PDF. 
</p>

<p>
Enjoy!
