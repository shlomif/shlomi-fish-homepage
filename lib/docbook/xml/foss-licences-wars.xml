    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
        When <ulink url="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky 
            ("Joel on Software")</ulink> wrote his notorious blog post
        <ulink url="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01.html">"Language
            Wars"</ulink>, many people asked whether he has "jumped the
        shark" and that his blog will go downhill from there. I too have read
        the post, and agreed, that while it had a few good points, it was
        too based on "feeling rather than knowing". Joel later on posted
        many good articles and shorter entries on his blog, but many people
        still recallled it as a very low-point in the blog.
    </para>

    <para>
        Like Joel, I have a home-site and several blogs, where I post articles
        and essays about my thoughts, and this time I've decided to risk
        something similar to what Joel has done on an equally flamatory topic:
        <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_licence">licences
            of open-source software</ulink>. I'm going to introduce the various
        options, explain a little about their history and motivation and then
        give some advice according to my own personal opinion.
    </para>

    <para>
        I should note that I am not a lawyer, and only write this according
        to my best knowledge, understanding and experience.
        <footnote id="ianal" title="IANAL">
            <para>
                Some people believe that discussing legal matters should be
                reserved to people who are Law experts. However, this is
                a <ulink url="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=39148&amp;cid=62149">sub-case 
                    of the "only specialists should deal with a
                specialised field" fallacy</ulink>.
            </para>
            <para>
                Like it or not, the Law affects us all and the Government
                expects common citizens to be aware of it and not violate
                it, even if they are not lawyers. As software developers, we
                do not limit discussions on software and computing to people
                with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (much less a
                Ph.D. or whatever) and often not-too-qualified people can be
                very knowledgable and/or productive.
            </para>
            <para>
                Similarly, I expect discussions on the governmental law to
                have a lower barrier for entry than people who are qualified 
                lawyers, or Law Professors.
            </para>
        </footnote>
        I think what I'm writing here is correct, but would still appreciate
        any correction for future versions. If you're unsure about my advice,
        then my advice to you is to consult a legal expert (if you
        can afford one) or your local or global Free and Open Source Software
        organisation. I cannot guarantee my advice is valid.
