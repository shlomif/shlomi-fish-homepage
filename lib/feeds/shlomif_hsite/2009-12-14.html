<p><strong class="sayer">Guy #1:</strong> yeah, problem with adventurers - they are trouble makers. They create
troubles where none exist before so they can solve them later.

I added the text of 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/elephant-in-the-circus/" rel="nofollow">the parable of the Elephant in the Circus</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I once walked to a circus and saw a huge elephant tied to a small poll with a
rope, just standing there. So I wondered why is the elephant so obedient and
doesn’t break away from the stick with all of its enormous strength and mass.
So they told me this story: once when the elephant was very young, it was tied
to the pole the same way. Naturally, it didn’t like that and tried to escape,
but try as it might, the rope and the pole were too strong for it. So the
elephant eventually gave up.

Finally, the section navigation menus of the various sections are now 
formatted in a nice, expandable, GUI-like tree (assuming JavaScript is 
enabled). If JavaScript is not enabled, there’s a standard HTML fallback. This
