A Jewish Deduction

The Bible dictates that "Thou shalt not seethe [= cook] a kid [= young goat]
in his mother's milk." To avoid any possibility of breaking that regulation, 
the Jewish tradition ruled that it also applies to female goats, to mature
goats, and to the meat and milk of two completely unrelated goats. It is 
also forbidden to eat the meat with fresh milk, and it applies to beef 
and mutten as well (including mixing the milk and meat of two different
beasts). Finally, chicken, which are incapable of milk production, may not
be eaten along with any mammal's milk either. 

We are fortunate that most mathematicians were not Jewish. Otherwise, it
would have been forbidden to divide by all numbers between -1 and 1.

Suggested Improvements to the Documentation:

The WYSIWYT project was for a long time fascinated by Microsoft's tremendous 
desire to advance its Internet Explorer web-browser. We saw the fact that 
they switched the help systems of the upcoming Windows 98, as well as 
Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0, to HTML a major step in advancing our project.

As a complementary step, some of the chief heads of our project suggested
that the Windows' manuals themselves, as well as all of Microsoft's ads,
will be designed in HTML and printed after being rendered by IE4. While this
project is in the preliminary and planning stages, we expect it to acquire a
large momentum soon.

Yeah and what are the offerings of the open-source world? Let's see:

1. Linus Torvalds - Looks like a dweeb, ergo is a dweeb. How girly is that?
(plus his wife can kick ass better than him)
2. Richard M. Stallman - a hippy. How girly is that?
3. Eric S. Raymond - a nice looking man with a mustache. Baby faced, so he
looks a bit girly to me.
4. Larry Wall - a cross between Linus and RMS (i.e: a hippy dweeb) that is
even more girly.

So who do we have left? Alan Cox? OK, he's manly. (huge man, huge facial hair,

 <spyro_boy>  rindolf, I tried learning C,C++, and Java, but I couldn't

      <buubot>  Perl 6, unlike most people, is able to breathe in the
                vacuum of space. In fact, anything else would damage its
                respiratory system. Because of this, whenever it's
                visiting Earth, it wears a respirator, which resembles a
                kickass beard.
     <rindolf>  Heh heh.
     <rindolf>  Are all of buubot's wankit factoids about Perl 6?
     <rindolf>  He should have some about Chuck Norris, too.
      <merlyn>  fictional factoids about a partially designed, partially
                implemented, partially wanted language. :)
     <rindolf>  merlyn: yeah.
      <merlyn>  Heh - those are all Chuck Norris quotes with s/Chuck/P6/
 <dabreegster>  rindolf: It's written in Chuck Norris, right
      <merlyn>  Chuck Norris writes code in Perl 6. Before Larry's done.
                And it works.
     <rindolf>  merlyn: Chuck Norris wrote Perl 6 in a day but then
                destroyed all evidence with his bare hands, so no one
                will know his secrets.

     <rindolf>  ajs: perhaps Chuck Norris would be a useful addition to
                the Pugs and Parrot teams.
         <ajs>  rindolf: If Norris can write, give him a commit bit, and
                tie him to a keyboard ;)
  <FurnaceBoy>  I thought he already had commit
       <daxim>  Chuck Norris commits with a roundhouse kick into the SVN
                server's head
             *  FurnaceBoy chuckles
         <ajs>  daxim: If you can get that to pass the test suite, then
                more power to you!
  <FurnaceBoy>  Chuck *is* the test suite
     <Kattana>  chuck norris does not code, when he sits at a
                computer, it just does whatever he wants.
     <rindolf>  Kattana: :-)
       <daxim>  ah, we're easy to amuse
         <ajs>  Be the test suite, Chuck... BE the test suite.
  <FurnaceBoy>  you gotta pass 'make chuck'

 <LeoNerd>  They can be quite useful, but they do have a crazy amount of
            dependencies..
 <LeoNerd>  And sometimes they can be a bit unstable - I think they're
            still beta-testing

     <Alexi5>   what is a good book for getting up to speed with  perl?
     <merlyn>   learning perl!
     <merlyn>   intermediate perl!
    <nachos_>   the camel is the _only book_
    <nachos_>   :-P
            *   merlyn bats nachos silly
    <nachos_>   :-(
    <rindolf>   Alexi5: there's also Beginning Perl, which is available 
                online.
            *   f00li5h saw that coming
    <rindolf>   You should learn Perl from "Learning Perl in 24 minutes 
                Unleashed!"
    <f00li5h>   rindolf: ``Learning perl in 24 minutes Unleashed, in a 
                nutshell for dummies'' is the one i have
    <rindolf>   f00li5h: that's even better.
