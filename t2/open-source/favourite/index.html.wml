<h2 id="linux"><a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a></h2>

<p>
Linux is a UNIX clone for many platforms including regular PCs. It is fast,
stable, powerful and very cool.
</p>

<h3 id="mandriva"><a href="http://www.mandriva.com/">Mandriva Linux</a></h3>

<p>
Mandriva is my Linux distribution of choice. In the Linux world, distributions
are a collection of the Linux kernel and user-land utilities and libraries
in a nice packaging. Mandriva is an open-source distribution with good ties
into the community. It is especially suitable for use on the desktop, but is
also suitable for running Internet and Intranet servers.
</p>

<p>
While not as hyped as other distributions are, Mandriva is very decent, and
is suitable for both beginner and advanced users.
</p>

<h3 id="user_mode_linux"><a href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">User-mode 
Linux</a></h3>

<p>
User-mode Linux is a port of the Linux kernel to run as a process on top of a
normal operating system. This is very useful for virtualisation, security,
and kernel development. It is now an integral part of the Linux kernel.
There's <a href="http://umlwin32.sourceforge.net/">a port to Windows 32-bit</a>
available as well.
</p>

<h3 id="virtualbox"><a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a></h3>

<p>
A great cross-platform x86 virtual machine emulator that allows one to run
virtual machines of operating systems, with graphics, networking and
everything else. A complete life-saver, and it's free and open-source.

Mac OS X and many flavours of UNIX. Also see 
<a href="$(ROOT)/open-source/anti/autohell/">my page about "GNU Autohell"

<p>
cygwin is an open-source Linux-like environment for Windows, that enables

Windows much more bearable.
</p>

<h3 id="windows-console"><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/console">Improved
Windows Console</a></h3>

<p>
The so-called "Console" is a great replacement for the dysfunctional 
Microsoft Windows' console window (so-called "DOS Box") that has tabs, allows 
one to have presets for several different shells and programs, is very 
customisable and is great for all those people who are using the 
command-line on windows.
</p>

<h3 id="ogg_for_wmp"><a href="http://www.illiminable.com/ogg/">Illiminable Ogg Directshow 
Filters for Free Codecs for Windows Media Player (WMP), etc.</a></h3>

<p>
These are filters to enable playing of <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">the Ogg 
Vorbis file formats</a> and other open codecs in Microsoft's Windows Media 
Player. All the other filters I found were out-of-date, required hackish 
tweaks, and even did not play the files well or supported visualization. 
Illiminable's on the other hand works well out of the box.
</p>

<h3 id="youtube-dl"><a href="http://www.arrakis.es/~rggi3/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</a></h3>

<p>
I often get reffered to or find videos on 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, but they are relatively
inaccessible, because of my Linux configuration. But using youtube-dl, I can
easily download the video files to my home computer, where I can conveniently
play them using <a href="#mplayer">MPlayer</a>, and also keep them on my hard 
disk for posterity. Highly recommended.
</p>

<p>
If you're <a href="$(ROOT)/open-source/anti/qmail/">unfortunate enough
to use qmail</a> for some of your mail accounts, and still wish to filter
out all the viruses that arrivate at your account, then Qclam may be the
right solution for you. QClam is a program that feeds the message to ClamAV,
and reports the verdict in a way that dot-qmail files can understand.
</p>
