I recall that most coins of Earth antiquity were crudely drawn. During the middle ages, there was an Arabic Sultan or Khalipha that insisted that the coins of his kingdom will be minted with exquisite design and craftmanship. This is despite the fact that he believed mining gold was time-consuming. In actuality a lot of the gold was duplicated or conjured using magic or super-natural technology.
</p>

<p>
He called this coin the "Dinnar", and it had unparalleled aesthetic appearance.

Now some of the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition implied lessons similar to "easy comes; easy goes", or “you reap what you sow”.

Towards the year 2000, there was a lot of international and universal,
scientific and engineering demand for the Gold chemical element, but its
price was often prohibitive.
</p>

<p>
One fact that made Gold costly was its use by pricey jewellery which indicated
that the woman who wore them was both rich, and physically strong. However,
even the strongest women reported that they were inconvenienced by wearing the
heavier jewels. Moreover, their cost was no longer prohibitive enough to
indicate wealth, yet high enough to indicate being frivolous. Moreover, there
was competition from cheap, light, accessories, made from cheaper materials,
which also usually looked better.
</p>

<p>
Around that time, the Ferengies decided that money can weight very little (e.g:
1,000 USD bills) or even effectively be weightless (e.g: the integers holding
the accounts balances on banks' computers). This is given the low-mobility of
gold bars, or latinum ones. The universal economy seems to have coped well with
this change.
