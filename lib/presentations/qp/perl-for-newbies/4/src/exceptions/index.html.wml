<p>
Exceptions are a mechanism to raise an error in a program which will propogate
to outside blocks, until it is caught by an explicit catching block, or
it terminates the program. It is a convenient way to manage errors.

In Perl, there is a statement that throws an exception, and one that catches 
it. The exception may escape out of function calls as well.
