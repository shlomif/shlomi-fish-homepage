This document is a list of questions and answers to common questions I have
been asked or have found myself answering or telling about. I don’t mind being
asked the same question more than once (even by the same person) because I
still enjoy answering it. (See also
<a href="http://wilwheaton.net/faq.php">what Wil Wheaton says about it</a>
at the beginning of his FAQ.)
</p>

<p>
But this document is here just in case, you have a question, or at least so
I can link to it.

Furthermore, like Ayn Rand in <a href="#fav_fiction_books"><i>The
Fountainhead</i></a> I believe in <a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#karma">karma</a>, and that being nasty, dishonest, unkind, and not generous, to
people can bite you further down the road. This is while being kind, honest, respectful, and generous, returns seven folds.
<a
href="[% base_path %]humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-perl-hurting-people">buu
almost got himself killed</a> due to frequent online chat hostility and use
of [% IRC %] force (kicks, devoices, or bans). In addition, a former boss of mine who
used to walk in the middle of the roads (hubris) in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gush_Dan">Gush Dan</a>, got badly injured
in a car accident.
</p>

<p>
While I consistently tried to act in the most benevolent way possible, I
noticed that some of my failings were paid after or before they happened.
For example, after many "people" <a href="https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/faq.html#what_are_the_uses_of_a_solver">asserted that Freecell Solver was useless</a>,
I thought the same about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNUstep">GNUstep</a>.
</p>

<p>
(Note that I generally don't need the fear of retaliation to try to be honest and noble to my fellow men. This is because I enjoy being noble. )

<img alt="photo of Shlomi Fish in December 2020" class="highlight" src="[% self_photo_url %]" />

<p>
I am <a href="[% base_path %]personal.html">Shlomi Fish</a>, a professional Israeli
software developer, and author of articles, essays, presentations, and funny
screenplays, stories, aphorisms and bits. I have a Bachelor of Sciences (B.Sc.)
from
the [% Technion %] in Electrical Engineering, but it would be a stretch to call
me an Electrical Engineer, at least with my current level of expertise in
the field. I’m actually more of a programmer, a software-development
geek, and a specialised mathematician.
</p>

<p>
At the moment, I’m a computer geek, which is a person who is enthusiastic about
computers, and a former “dork”/“nerd” which mean a person without a social life,
because I recently started to increasingly socialise more. I’m
interested in many other fields, including linguistics, history, writing,
children and non-children literature, and T.V. and movies.
</p>

<p>
I should note that I am only <b>one</b> person, and in fact am unaware of
any other “Shlomi Fish”’es of significance (at least not
according to Internet searches).

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "guy_or_girl" title = "Are you a Guy or a Girl?" %]

<p>
I am very much a guy, despite what my first name’s suffix (the “i” of
“Shlom<b>i</b>”) may imply to English speakers. I am also (mostly)
heterosexual, but I hate being a macho in real-life, and have some other
qualities that are considered somewhat feminine. However, I do not think that
I’m a woman born in a man’s body. (Or a lesbian born in a man’s body, for that
matter.)
</p>

<p>
Many Israeli masculine names end with an “i”: Avi, Ari, Meni, Beni, Ori, Uri,
Udi, Eli, etc. An “i” suffix means “of me” or “mine” in Hebrew (the possesive
of singular 1st person, both masculine or feminine). It can also mean “having
the property-of” (like “-ful” in English, in singular masculine for all of
1st/2nd/3rd persons). There are also many Israeli Hebrew feminine names that
end with “i”. One reason I’m using “Shlomi” instead of “Shlomy” is because
“Shlomy” might be pronounced to rhyme with the word “my”.
</p>

[%- END -%]

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "your_name" title = "What can you say about your name?" %]

<p>
Well, “Shlomi” or “שלומי” in Hebrew (see its <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomi_%28Hebrew_name%29">wikipedia
entry</a>) means “my Shalom” in Hebrew, or perhaps “Shalom-ful” (=
having the property of Shalom) or “Shalom-Jehovah”.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalom">“Shalom”</a> is an ancient Hebrew
word, that is derived from
<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Proto-Semitic/%C5%A1al%C4%81m-">proto-Semitic
origins</a> meaning something like “completeness”: “well-being”, “welfare”, "harmony",
"wholeness", even "prosperity" (but probably not really “excitement”) - not only “peace”/tranquility. It is an ambiguous noun as the nouns of some ancient Semitic
languages were. See also
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/42172.html">what
I wrote about it on my blog</a> (and some of the comments I received).
</p>

<p>
True to my name, I often feel that I have "more luck than brains" (as hard as
it is to believe given many smart people consider me very smart) and while
enduring some hardships (including physical ones!) was often at the right place
at the right time. That was including on a certain Internet/television/etc.
forum or resource and came up on top. Moreover, my body remained complete.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, just like <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15887/jewish/Chapter-3.htm">king Solomon [“Shlomo”] in the bible</a>, I wanted
to be kind, good hearted, and benevolent as a child by inspiration from
fairy tales I read or listened to.
</p>

<p>
The reason why it is “Shlomi” or “Shelomi” instead of “Shalomi” is due to
a certain pronunciation transformation in Hebrew, where certain vowels
are shortened into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shwa">Shwa</a>
when they are distanced too much from the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_%28linguistics%29">Stress</a> of
the word. Quite a few non-Hebrew speakers have issues with pronouncing Hebrew
words that start with several Shwas in succession (as
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/Selina-Mandrake/ongoing-text.html#is-moshes-ben-amram-the-jewish-prophet">this
scene</a> from a screenplay I wrote indicates).
</p>

<p>
Now, most Israelis pronounce this name with the stress on the “lo”. I, however,
prefer it to be pronounced with the stress on the “mi”, albeit I also answer
to people who pronounce it the other way. My version is the correct
Biblical pronunciation. You can hear me pronounce it in
<b>Hebrew</b>
(<a href="sounds/How-I-pronounce-Shlomi-Fish-Hebrew.ogg">Ogg</a>,
<a href="sounds/How-I-pronounce-Shlomi-Fish-Hebrew.mp3">mp3</a>)
and in <b>English</b>
(<a href="sounds/How-I-pronounce-Shlomi-Fish-English.ogg">Ogg</a>,
<a href="sounds/How-I-pronounce-Shlomi-Fish-English.mp3">mp3</a>).
</p>

<p>
Please spell the name as starting with “Sh”, similar to the common spelling
in English — not with “Sch” (the German spelling).
</p>

<p>
My last name - “Fish” (“פיש” in the Hebrew alphabet) - naturally means
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish">the aquatic organisms</a> in
English or (with a different spelling) in German. It was the last name of my
late grandfather who was a Polish-born Jew, and I’m still carrying it.
</p>

<p>
“Fish” is an uncommon name in Israel, but there are also some variations
such as “Fisher”, “Fishman”, “Fischer”, “Fishlov”, “Fishelson”, etc.
</p>

<p>
Note that the last name “Fish” is not meaningful in Hebrew. In fact, in
Ancient Hebrew, the only possible pronunciation would be “Pish” (which means
“pee” or “urine” in Modern Israeli Hebrew slang). That is because it uses the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe_%28letter%29">same letter - פ</a> for
both the "P" and the "F" sounds, and it would be "P" in the beginning of the
word.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
I had not given my last name a lot of thought until relatively recently
(= 2022-08-25), but now think it may imply:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
“Plenty of fish in the sea” - pluralism, open-mindedness and tolerance.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Progressing carefully, but steadily, possibly despite feeling some fear, like a
timid little fish exploring the ocean.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
“Fishy” - weird/strange.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
A contraction of “finish” and I like to bring projects and tasks to a usable
state, and move on (while possibly revisiting them later):
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfection#Paradoxes">Perfection is in
imperfection</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.amatecon.com/fish.html">“Give a man a fish; you have fed
him for today. Teach a man to fish; and you have fed him for a lifetime”</a> -
I invest time in learning useful technologies, and have little patience for
helping people who wish to remain wilfully ignorant of knowledge which I
consider essential.

<p>
Well, I was born in Israel in 5 May 1977, and lived in Tel Aviv for a
year. Then, when I was 1 year old, my parents moved to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas">Dallas, Texas, USA</a> for
my father’s post-Doctorate and later on we moved to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockville%2C_Maryland">Rockville,
Maryland, USA</a> and stayed there until I was about 5. Then, we moved
back to Tel Aviv and I lived in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramat_Aviv_Gimel">Ramat Aviv Gimel</a>
ever since. This was with some relatively brief trips to other places in Israel, to
Europe, to the United States and to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia">Victoria</a>
in Canada.
</p>

<p>
Currently (October 2024), I live with my parents in Hakim Eliyahu St. No. 4, apartment No. 12
(on Floor 3), Tel Aviv, Israel ( <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Eliyahu+Khakim+St+4,+Tel+Aviv-Yafo/@32.1254617,34.7989148,17z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x151d4914a516fce5:0x8b1c395ce5fd1089!2sEliyahu+Khakim+St+4,+Tel+Aviv-Yafo!3b1!8m2!3d32.1254572!4d34.8011035!3m4!1s0x151d4914a516fce5:0x8b1c395ce5fd1089!8m2!3d32.1254572!4d34.8011035!10m2!1e3!2e1">Google maps</a> ), and I'm usually at home there, usually either using one of my computers,

<p>
As I noted previously, while I am attracted a little to men, I am much more
attracted to women. Given I am a non-trans male-by-birth that makes me mostly
straight. (References: <a href="[% base_path %]humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-web--lesbian-straight-and-Sappho">#web - Lesbianism, heterosexuality, and Sappho</a>.)

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "what_did_you_study" title = "What did you study in university / college? Did you study computer science?" %]

<p>
I studied in the [% Technion %], completed my Undergraduate studies, and
graduated with a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in Electrical Engineering (“Proper”,
rather than “Computer Engineering” or “Computer &amp; Software Engineering”)
diploma. That put aside, my studies involved quite a lot of software
development and engineering-related mathematics. I also have not done a lot of
EE or electronics work, before or after my degree studies, while doing quite a
lot of software development.
</p>

<p>
Given how I recall my academic studies as being frustrating, vexing, and often
not interesting, I am not planning on working on getting another academic
degree (whether a B.Sc, an M.A/M.Sc, a Ph.D, or similar) soon. However, I cannot
promise that I won't change my mind about that in the future and enrol again.
</p>

<p>
The funny thing is that while my father and two sisters all have
doctorates, I am considered the smartest one. That may have to do with
me being <a href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1174648725316218880">more
confident and "showy"</a> and more likely to flaunt or utilise my skills.

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "nicknames" title = "How else are you known?" %]

<p>
I’m also known as “shlomif” or on the [% IRC %] as “rindolf”.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, an Englishwoman Internet friend of mine, who can be amusing at
times, has nicknamed me <a href="[% base_path
%]humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=unflattering-nicknames">"Slimy Fish"</a>.  I
didn't find that offensive, possibly because I was no longer underage, and
because I liked her; she also nicknamed the blocky <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet">("Print") Hebrew
alphabet</a> "Tetris".
</p>

[% WRAPPER h4_section id = "origin_of_rindolf" title = "What is the origin of your “rindolf” IRC nickname?" %]

<p>
For more information about the name "rindolf", see
<a href="[% base_path %]me/rindolf/">the dedicated page about my Rindolf nickname</a>.
</p>

<p>
Rindolf “Woman-hands” [Forgot the last name] was a Dwarven warrior I
played on a series of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Advanced_Dungeons_.26_Dragons_2nd_edition">AD&amp;D 2nd edition</a> sessions,
and one of my favourite tabletop Role Playing Games characters of all times.
I probably picked up the name by analogy with such Germanic-originating names
as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randolph_%28given_name%29">Randolph</a>
or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_%28name%29">Rudolph</a>.
I was told "Rind" means "cattle" in Germanic languages, but what matters is
that it has a nice ring.
</p>

<p>
The first [% IRC %] nickname I used was “dori” after one of the dwarves in
Tolkien’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit">The Hobbit</a>.
Later on, I decided it was a too common name, so I switched to “gloin”, the name
of a different dwarf there. Then I wanted something more original, so I picked up
“rindolf” and the name stuck.
</p>

<p>
If I had been able to change it again, I would have picked “shlomif” for my [%
IRC %] career, because it is my handle almost everywhere else, but now everyone
on [% IRC %] know me as “rindolf” so I feel it's too late (not to mention that,
in my impression, it is common and acceptable to use a pseudonym on [% IRC %], to
show some creativity).
</p>

<p>
The running joke we have on [% IRC %], is that Rindolf is the evil twin brother
of Santa Claus’s goody-two-shoes reindeer, Rudolph and Randolph, who are
among his arch-enemies. Rindolf is also one of the cornerstones of the
Evil Reindeer Evil World Domination Evil Conspiracy, with the evil aim to
spread the Reindeer Evil all over the world. You can find some of the
manifestations of this joke in

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "refer_or_address" title = "How should I address you or refer to you?" %]

<p>
When writing a letter to me, you can start it with
“Hi Shlomi!”, “Dear Shlomi,”, “Hello Shlomi,” etc. or with “Hi Mr. Fish”,
“Dear Mr. Fish”, etc.
</p>

<p>
Note that using “Hello Fish” is considered disrespectful! I hate it when people call
me “Fish” to my face, albeit “Mr. Fish” is acceptable. You can also use my
<a href="#origin_of_rindolf">“Rindolf”
nickname</a> with or without a “Mr.” honorific. Also see <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/01/26/getting-your-resume-read/">Joel on Software's note:</a>
</p>

<p>
In most of the English speaking world it is not considered polite to open
letters to a Mr. Joel Spolsky by writing “Dear Spolsky.” One might write “Dear
Mr. Spolsky,” or “Dear sir,” or perhaps, “Hi Joel!” But “Dear Spolsky” is
usually followed by some story about embezzled funds and needing to borrow my
bank account.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
Some letters begin with “Shlomi,” in a separate paragraph. I personally
feel that the person is trying to preach to me in this case, but
I was told it is not considered bad form in English-speaking countries,
so it may just be a cultural gap.
</p>

<p>
If you wish to refer to me in third person, you should start with
“Shlomi Fish” and continue with “Shlomi”, “Fish”, “Mr. Fish”, etc.
Alternatively you can start with “Shlomif”, “shlomif”, or “Rindolf”,
which are my common Internet handles which I use everywhere I can.

<p>
I don’t drink alcoholic beverages, don’t consume caffeinated beverages,
have never smoked (e.g.: cigarettes), and have never “done” any of the currently
illegal narcotics (e.g.: Marijuana, Cocaine, Heroin). I believe that
this way I’m less tired, more energetic, and less moody. I don’t need such
negative bio-physical aphrodisiacs to be happy, and probably neither do you.
</p>

<p>
Most of the people I talk with on the [% IRC %] who
consume caffeine have become dependent on it and cannot function without their
morning/mid-morning/midday/etc. coffee. On the other hand, I’m energetic from
the time I wake up until I go to sleep. As for alcohol, it has negative
short-term and long-term effects. And I also don’t want to become drunk because
it will cause me to lose control of myself, and do silly things and say silly
stuff.
</p>

<p>
I have never smoked or taken drugs, and intend to not do so. People with a
drug dependency reduce their happiness and self-esteem like this, and damage
their health.
</p>

<p>
All that put aside, I still believe <a href="[% base_path

Regarding food, I eat an omnivorous diet that includes meat (chicken, beef,

First of all, in this day and age, it’s unlikely that the spammers <b>will
not find</b> my email address. That’s because they also install a lot of
malware on vulnerable computers to harvest email addresses from. Since I can’t

never prevent spam entirely.

<p>
[% IF 0 %]
I deal with spam by filtering it on the client side. I’m using
<a href="[% base_path %]open-source/favourite/#spamassassin">SpamAssassin</a>
to filter my email and so far it’s doing a very good job. Some spam still
arrives at my inbox, but otherwise very little. There are

spam filters</a> (and some non-open-source solutions), which you may wish

</p>

<p>
All of that put aside, I think that having a convenient “mailto:” link
is recommended because people don’t need to go through inconvenient
hoops to send you an email. I love receiving (good) email about my site,
and I’d rather not throw away the baby along with the water, just because
spammers may have an easier time harvesting my already public email address.

This is <a href="http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20030803">EvilPHish</a>
from the
<a href="http://userfriendly.org/">comics’ strip UserFriendly.org by
Iliad</a>. I was a big fan of UserFriendly.org when EvilPHish was featured
there, and it was so me, so I decided to make it my emblem. After downloading
the big version of the comic, and tampering with it a little with
<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP (= the GNU Image Manipulation
Program)</a>, I was able to produce a transparent PNG file that I could use.
</p>

<p>
After a while, I realised that most people recognised this emblem and
associated it with me, in part because my last name is “Fish”. Therefore, I
decided to standardise on it as a user-pic or “avatar” everywhere, and so I
did. Note that the image is still copyrighted by Mr. Iliad, but I hope its use
by me is acceptable.
</p>

<p>
As a child and a teenager, I’ve been a bit frustrated by my last
name being “Fish”, and was often teased for it. But I feel OK about it now,
and it’s good that people can associate my last name with something
they are familiar with, and with a memorable emblem such as EvilPHish.

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "how_did_you_learn_english" title = "How did you learn English?" %]

<p>
Well, I am Israeli-born, but my parents moved to the United States when
I was one year old until I was five years old (first to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas">Dallas, Texas</a>,
and then to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockville,_Maryland">Rockville,
Maryland</a>), where I spoke English with the fellow children. However, after
I returned to Israel at the age of five, the children there ridiculed me
for my English. As a result, I did not want to speak it, and so forgot
most of it, and just spoke Hebrew (which is my mother language).
[% childhood_mem %]
</p>

<p>
After that, I had to regain English much more painfully as I learned it
at school, and from other sources such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game">computerised Adventure
games</a>, books, films, Television shows, and the Internet.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after high school, I felt that my English has dramatically improved.
Nonetheless, looking back at my English text from a few years back, I cringe at
how bad it was, and some native speakers tell me that some of my writing is
non-idiomatic.
</p>

<p>
I'm still trying to improve and not rest on my laurels (like I try with other
skills and moral qualities I care about).
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> I think my English improved after high school, despite the absence
of a formal scholastic frame, due to a mixture of reading books, reading
Internet texts in English, reading software documentation (I was employed as a
software developer), watching some Television shows, and more practice at
writing English texts (using computers' keyboards).
</p>

[%- END -%]

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "how_can_I_improve_my_English" title = "How can I improve my English?" %]

<p>
Some of the effective ways I found to improve one's English are:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Write. Write a lot. Start a blog. Write about interesting stories from your
past. Ask your readers to point out the issues in your text (and also in your
code). Maybe start specialised blogs for writing about topics that interest
you.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Read. Read a lot. Especially fine literature, though not too archaic. I really
like reading quality Children and Young Adult's Literature in
English (e.g: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit"><i>The Hobbit</i></a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Island"><i>Treasure Island</i></a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Nesbit">E. Nesbit</a>, Roald Dahl, Mary
Poppins, Sherlock Holmes). There are many public domain and freely
distributable fiction online in Project Gutenberg.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Pay attention to what you write and how you phrase yourself. Don't write
too hastily.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Chat with English speakers on [% IRC %] - I like
<a href="https://freenode.net/">Freenode</a> for that and they have an
##English channel, but other channels accept
somewhat off-topicish discussion, especially some #not-channels or channels
like #perlcafe , or #perl-cats, which
are intended solely for off-topic discussion.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Watch/listen to some films to see how people use the English language in
speech. There are many clips on YouTube and similar sites and you can learn a
lot from them. There are some larger scale videos available online, offline
and on torrents naturally.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Most importantly - remember that improving your language is hard work, but
it's also fun, because hard work is often fun and rewarding and makes you
happy. The opposite of fun and pleasure in general is not necessarily work. If
people did not enjoy hard work for pleasure, then large-scale operating
systems that are completely free-and-open-source-software such as GNU/Linux or
the *BSDs could not happen.
</p>

</ol>

<p>
You can find some other recommended online resources for learning English
and improving it in <a href="https://github.com/yvoronoy/awesome-english">the
“Awesome English” curated list of links</a> on GitHub.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> please do not use a two way bridge from and to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translate">Google Translate</a>
or similar services <b>exclusively</b>, because you can improve your English,
but cannot easily improve that of Google Translate, because it often emits
non-functional translations, and because it will encourage you to learn less.
</p>

<p>
Google Translate has some legitimate use cases (such as trying to get the gist of
a page in a foreign language) but, like most other tools, it has

instead has a man-invented shape.
</p>

<p>
As a result, the d10 became a symbol of power of mine. Now what I do with them:

After I donated my role-playing games' gear to a local role-playing-games club that my
friends ran, I was given
<a href="[% base_path %]me/rindolf/images/brown-1d10-SGlau-LARGE.jpg">a solid
brown 1d10 die</a> that my friends at the time (~1997ish) allowed me to take.
I carried it in my pencil case, and it became a symbolic object and
feel it brought me a lot of good luck and bad luck (which are often
<a href="http://www.naute.com/inspiration/luck.phtml">two sides of the
same coin</a>).
</p>

<p>
Now, however, I decided to give it to
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/bits/facts/Summer-Glau/">Ms. Summer Glau</a> (who is
a Hollywood actress, but much more than that for me), and it is now
her property, which I intend to officially pass it along to her and see what
she will decide to do with it.
</p>

<li>
<p>
I also buy d10s in large quantities (went up to 10 packs of 10 purple
translucent d10 dice each from
<a href="http://www.thedicestoreonline.com/">The Dice Shop</a>) and offer
to give them away to people I interact with in real life (IRL), such as
vendors, clerks and sellers in shops. While not everyone accepts them, many
people do.

<li>
<p>
Someone on [% IRC %] told us that he thinks everyone should be forced to play Chess
(in a true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism">authoritarian</a>

during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid">Apartheid</a>,
people of Black descent were legally forbidden from playing Chess.
</p>

<li>
<p>
I once agreed to play Chess with an online friend online. After the game was
over, he analysed my play, which I found annoying and made me reluctant to play
again (and felt like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beating_a_dead_horse">beating

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(number)">24 ("twenty-four")</a>.
Some reasons for it:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
It is the number of a local ( Tel Aviv ) bus that has been useful for me.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
5 + 5 + 7 + 7 = 24 based on <a href="#where_are_you_from">my birthdate</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
There are 24 hours in a day.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
24 is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">factorial</a>
of 4. That is “1×2×3×4 = 24”. Incidentally “1+2+3+4 = 10”.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Given “24 = 3 × 2³”, it can be written in C, Perl, Python, and similar
languages as <code>( 3 &lt;&lt; 3 )</code>. ( References: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operations_in_C#Left_shift_%3C%3C">C left shift operators</a>. )
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
2 ** 10 ( 2 to the power of 10 ), which is 1,024 ( and also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix#kibi">kibi</a> ) ends with “24”. This makes 24 the value of “f(m, n) = ( m ** n ) % ( n ** m )” for “f( m = 2 , n = 10 )”.

<p>
First of all, I should note that one’s general classification of a religious
inclination (e.g: Jewish, Atheist, Agnostic, Deist, Muslim, Christian,
Buddhist, etc.) is not always indicative of their idea system or philosophy.
Also note that, despite the fact that I am Jewish by ethnicity and heritage,
and studied (or was forced to study, although I often enjoyed it) some of the
Jewish writings, and incorporated influences from Judaism in my writing, I am
not a religious or observant Jew.
</p>

<p>
All that put aside, I consider myself a self-sufficient, optimistic,
idealistic and anti-cynical, pluralistic, anti-Fatalist, agnostic. Now let me
explain what all those mean:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
I’m <b>agnostic</b> because I’m not sure whether God — however he/she/they/it are
manifested — exists or not. I suspect they do, but don’t take chances and
<a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#tie_your_camel">don’t
wish to risk dying</a> - now or ever.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I’m <b>self-sufficient</b> because I believe that “The gods help those that
help themselves”, that “reality to be commanded must be obeyed” and all that
Jazz.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I am optimistic, idealistic and <b>anti-cynical</b>, because I believe that
people are inherently good, can be trusted and that humanity is going forward
instead of backward. I feel like my life is gradually improving and that
almost every day is the
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW3rK-giAaM">best day of my life</a>
so far, and that 2014 (when these lines were written) is the best year I can
remember (and I’m 1977-born).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I am <b>pluralistic</b>, because I constantly have derived and will derive
inspiration from
<a href="[% base_path %]me/rindolf/#rindolfism">many sources</a> and also try
to not dismiss an insight based on its source - see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem">Ad-hominem</a>,

<a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#dont_just_go_with_the_flow"><b>by

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews">Judaism</a> is much more than just
a religion, and it is also an ethnicity (or "peopleship" as I used to call it),
a culture, a heritage, and possibly many other things. There are many secular

<p>
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=neo-tech-selfishness">This
quote</a> from the Neo-Tech literature summarises the issues that led to
this confusion:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Although the contents of her book, The Virtue of Selfishness, are precisely
accurate and widely integrated, Ayn Rand committed an error by distorting the
word “selfishness” in fashioning a dramatic statement. The word “selfishness”
does have valuable, precise denotations of "an irrational, harmful disregard
for others". Rand could have strengthened her work by selecting accurate
wording such as rational self-growth. Instead, she unnecessarily bent and
undermined the precise, valuable meaning of selfishness. …As with selflessness,
selfishness is a form of immature, destructive, irrational behavior -- a form
of stupid behavior.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
( There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virtue_of_Selfishness#Use_of_the_term_selfishness">similar sentiments by other commentators</a> referenced on the book's
Wikipedia page. )
</p>

<p>
While I’m no longer a Neo-Tech purist, I still agree with them that both
selfish (= having an irrational, harmful, disregard for others) and selfless (=
having an irrational disregard for one’s self) behaviours should be avoided as
much as possible, and that one should strive for “Rational Self-Growth”.
Moreover, often “selfishness vs. selflessness” is presented as a false
dichotomy.

<p>
The way I see it, a “Randroid”, which is a portmanteau of "Rand" and "Android",
is an overzealous believer in Randianism, who
mindlessly parrots Rand's works. On the other hand, my <a href="[% base_path %]me/rindolf/#rindolfism">school of philosophy, “Rindolfism”,</a>
is a crossover one with many influences, and dynamic. Moreover, I don't take
Randianism as gospel, often deviate from it, and am critical of it. For
example, I wrote a <a href="[% base_path %]humour/TOneW-the-Fountainhead/">parody and modernisation of Rand’s novel <i>The Fountainhead</i></a>,
and also wrote <a href="[% base_path %]humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/"><i>Summerschool at the NSA</i></a>, which

<p>
Yes, I'm fully aware of that, and I think it does not matter too much.

<p>
First of all, note that in <a href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1165982522091737088">this tweet</a>,
I commented that:
</p>

<blockquote cite="">

argument. Many useful or insightful products/trends/movements have some zealots,
including atheism, but they are still useful.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
For the scope of this section, I shall restrict the discussion of Atheists to
those who believe or have a strong suspicion that God/the gods, however
he/she/they/it are manifested do not exist. There may be other kinds of belief
categories that fall under the umbrella of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism">atheism</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion">irreligion</a>,
but this subset of atheists does exist.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, from my experience,
some Atheists can be overzealous and even very pushy about it, fanatical, or
even have a cult of followers and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sycophant">sycophants</a>.
The original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism">Nazis</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism">Communists</a> were
ostensibly atheists but were destructive, and had their share of dogma,
which other people and I find irrational. Note however that by the time
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith">Samantha Smith</a>
many communist regimes were far more relaxed and rational in practice,
and I suspect that following the popularity of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colbert_Report"><i>The Colbert
Report</i></a>, most of the best "AltRight" neo-Nazi bloggers are parody ones.
</p>

<p>
I do not wish to imply all fanatics, whether atheists or otherwise, were as
destructive as them, just to note that believing or suspecting God does not
exist, does not automatically make you free of faith or pseudo-faith.
</p>

<p>
Note that currently I am <a href="#religious_belief">an agnostic</a>, and try
not to be overzealous and pushy about it, but I do not rule out that there were
or are or can be religious agnostics. Furthermore, I do not rule out that I may
have my share of irrationalities, fanaticism, or stubbornness, in other realms
of my life.
</p>

<p>
Just for the record, I recall reading on an Internet site, an excerpt from an
interview with one of the creators of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park"><i>South Park</i></a> (which I
admit I have not watched substantially) which was known for ridiculing various
religions. That excerpt noted that they thought that despite all that, they found atheism
to be the funniest religion, because the contemporary astronomical/astrophysical
model expects time to run out and end. This proved as one of the catalysts from
my transition from a dogmatic atheist, to an <a href="#religious_belief">open-minded
and pluralistic agnostic</a>.

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "will_you_renounce" title = "Given you belong to the philosophical school (e.g: Judaism, Israel ) whose adherents reportedly did some malevolent actions, are you going to renounce your membership of it?" %]

<p>
I think publicly disassociating from schools you belong to, often from birth, is not constructive. Renouncing my Jewishness or my Israelism, due to crimes that the media reported their adherents committed (and which I suspect are false as far as I am concerned) won't offset their spiritual influence on me.
</p>

<p>
I'm not condoning destructive and harmful actions (assuming they are real). I also think individuals and organisations should <a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/">encourage criticism and try to get offended</a>. Furthermore, I'm not a purist believer in "the system should be changed from within" adage. This is given that I think that often the criticism of people who are external to the philosophical school can be of merit (e.g. see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOfZLb33uCg">“Weird” Al Yankovic’s “Amish Paradise”</a> ).
</p>

<p>
However, I cannot diasassociate myself from every idea system or collective, just because some people disapprove of actions or opinions of some of its members. There are many details I find ridiculous even in the Hebrew Bible, and admit that it should not be followed to the letter. However, I think Atheism, Christianity, and Islam, also have "what-the-hell?" absurdities. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_No_Fan_Has_Gone_Before">Futurama episode “Where No Fan Has Gone Before”</a>, which I enjoyed watching, contemplates a future Earth where Star Trek would have become a religion.

<p>
I don't know how to cook well. I either depend on my family (actually my team
of watchers), eat something I find in the house as a snack or a meal, or can
afford to buy or order food from outside restaurants, kiosks or supermarkets.

I don't have a driver's licence, despite having taken many driving lessons
(and not passing the tests). I think I won't be a good driver, and can get

of some of their wives or husbands, I only registered the names and general
personalities of their two oldest children.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I'm a versed reader/writer only of Hebrew (both modern, Israeli, Hebrew, and,
to an extent, some stages of Biblical Hebrew), and modern English. I studied
French for 3 years and Literary Arabic for 6 years during my 7th-to-12th grades,
but has since lost most of my vocabularies of them.
</p>

<p>
I am a passive learner/recipient of Ancient Greek, Ancient Latin, Castilian Spanish, modern French, German, Yiddish, Aramaic, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, and other languages given their past or present cultural influence and importance. However, I dislike formally studying new human languages because I feel memorising their vocabulary clutters my memory. Some people may have better affinity for that than I do.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I forgot many names, especially family names of my old classmates, co workers,
etc.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I didn't yet read, much less memorise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">the whole Hebrew/Jewish Bible</a> (“Tanakh”). I read many parts either due to my (often fun) secular Jewish Israeli mandatory education lessons, or voluntarily. I have no short-term plans of reading the terresterial Complete Shakespeare, Plato’s Republic, the complete Mishnah and Talmud, the Quran, etc.

speakers in Israel also know Hebrew, but native Hebrew speakers (Jews/etc.)
usually do not have the motivation to learn Arabic or retain their knowledge
of it.
</p>

<p>
Some other notes:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
I studied Literary Arabic for 6 years in junior high and high school
and passed the 5 points matriculation exam in it. However, I lost most of
my vocabulary due to lack of use, and also do not readily remember some of the
grammar.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
A few Arab Israelis I spoke with told me it was easier for them to learn
to read and write Hebrew than it was to learn Literary Arabic, despite the
fact that the local Palestinian Arabic was their mother language. This is
due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diglossia">diglossia</a>
present there.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
If you know both English and Arabic, I can highly recommend listening to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PAgX-qf1f4">Shaike Ophir’s
"The English Teacher" skit</a>.

[% IF 0 %]
just note that it has a short introduction
in Hebrew reading “An English lesson in an Israeli-Arabic school in the lower grades. It is 07:30 in the morning. The children are assembled in the classroom. The Teacher enters - everyone stands up. The teacher says:”.

<p>
Despite being Jewish by blood and an Israeli resident and citizen, who received
secular Israeli education, I can testify that I am unaware of such a sinister
conspiracy that cannot be refuted by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam’s Razor</a>.
Moreover, some of my teachers at high school criticised

as deceitful anti-Semitic material.

<p>
It is true that in some of my stories I featured a conspiracy of <a

"hackers" or "geeks"),
who were in fact the good guys in history, and not limited to bona-fide Jews,
which was inspired by this and other sources. Nonetheless, these stories are
fictional, I do not take them at face value myself, and recommend others to not
take them literally, either (even though they may have implications about the
real world and convey some lessons about it).

<p>
I can testify that I am just an unemployed Israeli and secular Jewish web-writer and software developer.
Back at the time (when I was in the 11th grade), I was interviewed for whom I
believe were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200">Unit 8,200</a>
who asked me some questions about software engineering and cryptological
questions. I am a sloppy software developer and was far sloppier back then,
but they still wanted to hire me. They could not at the time due to a policy

ended up <a href="#idf_service">being exempt from the IDF service anyway</a>.

<p>
There is a

that all Israeli citizens are Mossad agents, which is headed by a secret cabal headed by <i>My Little Pony</i>’s fictional Pegasus pony <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Fluttershy">Fluttershy</a>.
Furthermore, it is commonly acknowledged that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman">Natalie Portman</a>

<p>
(I am just kidding about all that!).
</p>

<p>
Seriously now, if you meet such an agent online, they will likely admit it. If
they approach you in the outside world, they will likely admit it, and
even invite you for a meal or a drink and are not going to torture you.

<p>
Not at all. As of February 2021, the number of Palestinian residents in the
west bank and the Gaza strip, exceeds the number of Israeli citizens (including
Arab Israelis who identify as Palestinians). While there have been some acts of
murder by either side towards the other (sometimes as self-defence), they
usually were at most a few hundred deaths per year, and a far cry from
exceeding the natural population growths.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, given the bad reputation that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders">Superior orders</a>
(a.k.a. "The Nuremberg Defense") have received in the media, and popular
art and education, I presume most Israeli soldiers and other government
workers will refuse unethical orders (which likely won't be given
in the first place).
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> I am not condoning such deaths, just trying to put
their numbers into proportion.

<p>
Ironically, the worst Sadism I experienced was by "mental health"

both Hebrew speakers and Arabic speaker Israelis. However, being

[something] than [someone else]" ( called <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/superiority">"superiority"</a> I think ) or “I am [something]’s biggest fan” ( called <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/superlative">“superlative”</a> ).

<p>
Well, I originally set up my home-site on shlomif.il.eu.org, which is a free
DNS service, but it had a lot of DNS problems. Thus, I set up
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/">https://www.shlomifish.org/</a>. I didn’t
take shlomifish.org.il because .il domains used to cost a lot of money, and
also required co-ordination by a fax message (how low-tech!) upon every
change. I also didn’t want a .com domain because I feel I’m a private individual
rather than a company.
</p>

<p>
http://shlomifish.org/ used to be a parked hostname of my DNS registrar, but
now redirects to www.shlomifish.org. This is also the case for shlomifish.com,
which I bought later.

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "website_in_english" title = "Why is this website in English? Why is it not in Hebrew?" %]

<p>
For several reasons:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
There are many more English speakers (either as their mother tongue or as
a secondary language) than Hebrew speakers. So I’m reaching a bigger target
audience by writing in English.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Most native Hebrew speakers (i.e: Israelis) can read English well enough to
understand my English writing. So most of the target audience for writing stuff
in Hebrew will benefit from it very little.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I find it more comfortable and faster to type in English and express myself in
writing using English for most types of writing (some
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/">stories I’m writing</a> being an exception).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I often use a lot of tech jargon or slang, which is more difficult to
translate to Hebrew.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
That put aside, if you wish to translate a piece I wrote to any other
language (including Hebrew), feel free to do so. I contributed some
Hebrew translations to some English articles that other people originated,
and also translated some texts I wrote in Hebrew to English.
</p>

<p>
Note that <b>I’m using Commonwealth English</b> on this site. Partly because
I think that’s what Israelis are supposed to use, partly because I have been
somewhat British-oriented, and partly because it feels nicer to use an
uncommon spelling. I am still using US English spelling for source
code and for technical documents, though.
</p>

<p>
My thoughts are that both the British spelling and the American spelling (and
their common subset), are inconsistent and confusing, but I have to make
a choice of some sort.
</p>

[%- END -%]

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "spent_on_the_site" title = "How much time do you spend on this site?" %]

<p>
A lot. I spent several hundreds of hours on the site, possibly several
thousands. While the pages of this site were originally just a collection of
hand-maintained HTML pages, they were then converted to use
<a href="https://github.com/thewml/website-meta-language">Website Meta Language</a>, and converted to have a
common look and feel, a style that’s hopefully semantic, converted to use
<a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/">valid XHTML markup</a>
(XHTML 1.1 for the while); some navigation aids were added, etc.
</p>

<p>
All of the source code for the site is available online in various places. I’ve
prepared <a href="[% site_sources_url %]">a top-to-bottom
document</a> on how to compile the site from
scratch, but the CI scripts lie less. Some of the hand-crafted code was released as
<a href="http://web-cpan.shlomifish.org/latemp/">the Latemp static site
generator</a> or various <a href="[% shlomif_cpan %]">assisting
CPAN modules</a> under an open-source license.
</p>

<p>
I am still working on the site, both by adding new content and attractions,
by revising or correcting existing ones, by making it more usable, or by
trying to publicise new attractions in various online resources.
</p>

<p>
Recently (November 2019) I converted the main pages of the site from
Website Meta Language to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_Toolkit">Template Toolkit</a>,
which is faster and less quirky, and also implemented better caching for the
talks' slides.
</p>

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "site_history" title = "What can you tell me about this site’s history?" %]

<p>
Well, a journey of a thousand miles begins with one small step and continues
with many subsequent small steps.
</p>

<p>
My homesite started from a small number of static HTML pages kept on the
server of my workplace back then (Smart Link - smlink.com). It had the
address http://www.smlink.com/~shlomif/, now inactive,
where shlomif was my username on ibm.net back then (which ended up becoming
my general unofficial ID). We hosted the server behind our Point-to-Point
connection, which I can retrospectively tell was not a very good idea.
Moreover, we had to create the
alias in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services">IIS</a> specifically for me to put stuff there.
</p>

<p>
I recall that I had <a href="[% base_path %]humour.html">the Aphorisms collection</a>
with a few jokes I originated, as well as
<a href="[% base_path %]toggle.html">the report about the
algorithmic solution to the Toggle Squares
puzzle</a> which I had sent to its originator (with whom I was corresponding at
the time). And it also had a rudimentary pageful of links, and a bio.
</p>

<p>
When I became a student in the [% Technion %], I moved my site to its undergraduate
server at the address http://t2.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/ . There I added more
and more resources to the site. Here is
the site <a href="[% base_path %]meta/old-site-snapshots/">as of 1998</a>. I had a
limited quota there, and when I got
an account on “vipe”, a server managed by the students, I hosted part of
my home site there as well, as http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/ . The
two parts of the site had cross-links to one another.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I was about to graduate and so moved the t2.technion.ac.il part
of my homesite, first to shlomif.il.eu.org (a free hostname, which ended up
causing too many DNS problems), and then to www.shlomifish.org which is
where it has been residing until now. In the process, I converted all of the
main pages to
use <a href="http://thewml.org/">Website Meta Language</a> and what would
eventually become <a href="http://web-cpan.shlomifish.org/latemp/">Latemp</a>.
This has enabled the site to have a common look and feel, a nice CSS
stylesheet, a navigation menu and other navigation aids and other nice
features.
</p>

<p>
Eventually I realised that the vipe server has too much down time (due
to problems at the [% Technion %]’s network) and moved all of its content over
to the www.shlomifish.org domain.
</p>

<p>
Throughout all this time, many resources were added to the homesite: software,
essays, stories, artwork, presentations, puzzles, and more information about
myself. I also now maintain a large number of
<a href="[% base_path %]me/blogs/">blogs</a> and sites for my projects, as well as
sites I volunteered to maintain. I really like the way the web allows me to
express myself, and to communicate using text, hypertext, and other types of
media.
</p>

<p>
Even more recently, I've been writing more and more on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media">social media</a> outlets.
There’s <a href="#shlomif_on_the_web">a list</a> of my accounts for many
social media and user-generated-content sites on every page of my home site.
</p>

<p>
In case you’re interested in setting up a personal web site of your own, I
wrote
<a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/computers/web/create-a-great-personal-homesite/">an
essay about it</a>, which you can read.
</p>

[%- END -%]

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "homesite_or_blog" title = "Is www.shlomifish.org a blog?" %]

<p>
The short answer is that www.shlomifish.org is a good, old-fashioned,
Web 1.0-style, home site - not a weblog/blog/online journal. Despite all that,
my web site is fairly modern in its client-side technology and its
look-and-feel should be usable and attractive enough. I have
<a href="[% base_path %]me/blogs/">several blogs</a> and am not opposed to the
concept, but a classic web site has many advantages. For more information,

<b>Update: (November 2019)</b> I am now serving mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML#XHTML5">XHTML5</a> pages and also serving them as <code>application/xml+xhtml</code>.
</p>

<hr />

<blockquote cite="">

<p>
I feel that validating against an XHTML schema makes my code cleaner and less
buggy, because I need to have closing tags, as well as use a trailing “/” for
standalone tags, etc. I also find the additional XHTML 1.1 restrictions
to be a good idea.
</p>

<p>
Therefore I decided to make XHTML 1.1 the default doctype for the pages
on my site. The reason I’m serving them as <code>text/html</code> is because
<a href="[% base_path %]no-ie/">Microsoft Internet Explorer</a> does not handle
<code>application/xml+xhtml</code> properly, and I’d rather not needlessly
discriminate against people who still use it (possibly against their
will).
</p>

<p>
I realise that it stands against the XHTML standard, but I’m not a standards
purist, and want to be a bit pragmatic in still supporting Explorer.
Note that some pages in the <a href="[% base_path %]MathVentures/">Math-Ventures

because they contain <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a>.

<p>
The answer is that not everything that I wrote, quoted and/or placed on my
homepage and on other kinds of Internet and World Wide Web (WWW) mediums is
still something I agree with (i.e: I changed my mind since then), or should be
taken too seriously (i.e: may be amusing or thought provoking but isn’t really
something I agree with), or that should be taken as an unbreakable rule (i.e:
because such works are usually guidelines rather than something that should be
taken as gospel). So please take them with a grain of salt, and apply your
judgement.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, it does not help that I often omit the dates of creation and last
update from a resource, and that I sometimes neglect to add a “Recent Update”
note at the top of the page when it becomes irrelevant. If you have the

The simple answer to that question is: no. I speak my mind and express myself

think that deliberately removing text and other content from Web sites is the
modern-day equivalent to <a

necessary.

<p>
Most of the site is comprised
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">static HTML web
pages</a>, which are uploaded to the web-site as they are, <b>after</b> being
generated using templates, data, and programs. The site’s
<a href="[% site_sources_url %]">sources</a> are public and kept in
a public version control repository, which also contains some
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation">automated tests</a>
and makes use of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">continuous integration</a> service.
</p>

<p>
In modern web developer jargon, one can say I use a <a href="https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-tech-diary/blob/master/static-site-generators--despair.md">custom static site generator (SSG)</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/shlomif/shlomi-fish-homepage/blob/master/LICENSE.asciidoc">blanket licence</a> for the sources is CC-by-nc-sa for texts, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License">ASL 2.0</a> for code.
</p>

<p>
While I am not ashamed of the site’s sources, they have gone through a long
<a href="#site_history">history</a> and
<a href="https://leejo.github.io/2016/02/22/all_software_is_legacy/">legacy</a>.
I remain a big fan of static site generation, but there are probably
some better approaches out there for that. Furthermore, often it is simpler to just
write something of your own using a <a href="[% base_path %]open-source/resources/text-processing-tools/">good preprocessor or a template system</a>,
a good <a href="[% base_path %]open-source/resources/software-tools/">build system</a>
and some code glue. However, for me, converting to something else would be too
time-consuming, and I've already found some faults in some existing
popular-and-open-source static site generators that I tried.

Some people asked if I am running a content management system ("CMS") on my
hosting's web-service, and the answer is "no". I am not running <a
href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/WordPress/">WordPress</a>,
MovableType, Drupal, Joomla, MediaWiki, or whatever. As far as the web-server
is concerned, my site is static files that are served directly from the
filesystem. Moreover, these files contain substantial amounts of repetitive
markup and code.

<p>
Static sites require less maintenance than sites with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting">Server-side scripting</a> given the latter are potentially more prone to security exploits.

</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
From my experience, source codes of generated static sites, that are typically kept in version-control repositories (e.g: git ones), tend to get misplaced less frequently than those of sites using content-management systems, which are usually kept in SQL databases.

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "is_site_written_in_perl" title = "Is this site written in Perl?" %]

<p>
See <a href="#how_site_is_generated">above</a> - most of the site is generated
using code and data and is served as static content on the server. There are
about three
[% CGI %] scripts written in Perl 5 using
[% cpan.self_dist( "d" => "CGI-Minimal", ) %],
or in <a href="https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/">Python using Bottle.py</a>
but they do not serve most of the content.
</p>

<p>
It is true that I make use of a lot of Perl code to generate the site's
content, but the site's source code is not limited to Perl, and this code does
not run on the web server, nor is required to serve most of it.
</p>

<p>
I believe the [% CGI %] scripts are:

<p>
First of all, note that I do not consider myself an expert on load time
optimisations, and you may be able to find better advice elsewhere using
web searches.
</p>

<p>
That put aside, here are some factors that may contribute to this:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Some of it has to do with my <a href="#site_hosting">web hosting</a>,
currently HostGator. While not perfect, I am quite happy with them, and
can recommend them for shared hosting.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
It is possible the site does not receive a lot of traffic for a variety of
reasons. (I'm not sure.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The website is mostly
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">static</a> and served
from the server's hard disk directly without potentially costly
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting">server-side scripting</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I avoid loading unnecessary JavaScript codes and other resources from other
sites (with some possible exceptions.).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I enabled server-side <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/how-to-optimize-your-site-with-gzip-compression/">gzip/deflate/etc. compression</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
XHTML/HTML, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> are all
being minified. See <a href="https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier">HTML minifier</a>
for HTML, <a href="https://github.com/tdewolff/minify">Go minifiers</a> for
SVG, and <a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS">UglifyJS</a> for JavaScript.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I use common external stylesheets, script files, and images, instead of
embedding them on every page.
</p>
</li>

<li>

<p>
PNG images are compressed using
<a href="http://optipng.sourceforge.net/">OptiPNG</a> ; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a> images are used as well.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, I recently started to increasingly make use of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP">the WebP format</a>, whose files tend to
be smaller than PNG and JPEG ones, and look better and crispier than JPEG.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
I sometimes remove various embellishments of the site, that, while seemed a good
idea, or even were one in the past, are no longer needed.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The navigation menu is partly populated after the page load by using an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest">XMLHttpRequest</a>
(or so-called "AJAX") call to a static JSON file.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I sometimes reduce the size of the HTML markup by using wrapper tags
and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_combinator">child or descendent CSS combinators</a>.
Moreover, adding CSS classes or <code>id="…"</code> attributes to existing
tags can help even more.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I use webpack to remaster jQuery-UI’s distribution, and reduce its size.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Are all these techniques useful on each-and-every WWW request? Probably not.
Someone told me many pages of my site do not have too many images, whether
.webp or otherwise. ( <a href="[% base_path %]humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-gamedev--small-matter-of-filicide">Reference</a> . ) But I still prefer to
leave no stone unturned and not rest-on-my-laurels. ( <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Optimizing_Code_for_Speed/Factor_Optimizations">Reference: “Factor Optimisations”</a> )

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "site_markup_not_formatted" title = "Why is the site’s markup not formatted nicely?" %]

<p>
Some web developers told me they like to keep the markup they emit properly formatted
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style">indented</a>. I dislike
doing that because:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
It may harm <a href="#site_loads_quickly">its load time</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
It may provide users who look at it the illusion that it is the ultimate,
editable/patch-able <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code">source
code</a>. I already received one patch written directly against the generated
page of one of my sites, which was not immediately usable for me.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
People are unlikely to use my site's markup to learn web technologies. For this, I
recommend <a href="https://github.com/shlomif/Freenode-programming-channel-FAQ/blob/master/FAQ_with_ToC__generated.md#how-can-i-learn-web-development-htmletc">other resources</a>.

<li>
<p>
The ultimate sources used to <a href="#how_site_is_generated">generate</a>

not as if I keep my code non-indented.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Keeping the served markup properly formatted may be harder than simply
minifying it, and the proper formatting may vary according to taste.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Just like we often compile and link source codes to binary executables and
libraries, (even if the source code is publicly available), so we can think of
minifying web markups as compiling them in order to improve the <a

does not imply I do that in order to <a

rather than is a pervert, whose sexual preferences prevent him from

<p>
Anyway, do you really believe that when <a href="[% base_path %]humour/bits/facts/Taylor-Swift/">Taylor Swift</a>

violent in real life? While sometimes I felt a little like going on a mayhem
rage when there was a lot of commotion outside when I was trying to sleep or
concentrate, I didn't actually try to do that, and at most only ranted about it

Furthermore, just because I write about stuff like that, does not mean
I do not have enough self-control, or that I have sex with, sexually

Now regarding their <b>age</b>: yes, I'm aware that some of them are underage.
However, it may seem farfetched, but I think that underage
girls and boys can still be competent, both in their tangible endeavours,
but also in their sexual/romantic orientation. <a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#empowering_youth">Expecting them to remain disadvantaged</a> is detrimental.

Back at the time,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaulay_Culkin">Macaulay Culkin</a>,
who was the “alpha male” of a large part of the 1990s (despite his youth),
raised a few eyebrows, when marrying at the age of 18 shortly after high school
graduation. However, I recently heard of a Jewish couple of a husband and wife
who were 15 years old then (with the girl pregnant), and as scary as it
sounded, it didn’t seem too horrid of a thought. Some people
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQALLGsn-Fk">learn
faster than others</a>.
</p>

<p>
Just another note about Culkin: some people also criticised him for
possessing Marijuana and for its use. However, many young and not-so-young people
I talked with have had a history of Marijuana use, or even Marijuana addiction.
So I do not hold it against him. See my
<a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/politics/drug-legalisation/">essay, “The Case

should be made legal globally.

<p>
I also have
<a href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1505075791943589890">a hypothesis</a>
that pleasure, education (learning and teaching), and creativity / conception,
are closely intertwined. Since we cannot expect children to avoid having fun,

Am I attracted to attractive underage girls? I admit I am, but no more than
I am to <a href="#why_are_you_attracted_to_all_these_girls">those who are
well above the age of consent</a> (and usually much less).
I suspect most other men do too (and women are attracted a little to underage boys), and <a href="[% base_path %]humour/So-Who-The-Hell-Is-Qoheleth/ongoing-text.html#what-to-do-about-being-the-Damascus-alpha-male">repressing</a> these emotions won't make the situation better. (One may still opt to <b>suppress</b> them instead, i.e.: acknowledge their presence but not act in accordance to them.)
These feelings are automatic, harmless, and no amount of psycho-"therapy"
will prevent them.

Moreover, as of 2023-09-24 the first and only time I recall "getting physical"

<p>
As a matter of fact, it may be considered this way. My fan fiction may be
thought of as a modern age way of having <a

otherwise <a href="[% base_path
%]philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacking-heroism">heroes</a>,

or the Greek used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop">Aesop</a>.

Note that even if I idolise (or perhaps just <a

a person or a fictional character like that, it does not mean I actively
worship them using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism">pagan</a>
rituals. Nor do I believe they have supernatural superpowers, or see them as a
supreme authority of telling me what to do. So I believe it does not go against
the Jewish ethos. Moreover, the Jewish canon, sported some similar
idols/"gods"/heroes besides <a

One should also note that there has been mutual influence on the factoids, and by
them, with my longer <a

Often such facts are being made up about celebrities or fictional characters on

</p>

<p>
These "facts" are a natural evolution of <a

<p>
This was popularised by Hollywood, but from my experience, is detrimental in
this day and age (~January 2021). I find that releasing screenplays (or essays
or software) in an "imperfect" or often even incomplete state, helps getting input
from readers, reviewers, and collaborators, which even if negative and
"destructive", helps in the thought process.
</p>

<p>
For example, after writing the first three stanzas of

it took me close to a year to come up with a better (and shorter) plot.

<p>
When I was in the 4th grade (back around 1987), my father bought my family
a PC XT machine, with 640 KB of memory, and a colour
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter">CGA</a>
screen. Using this, my
friends and I started learning how to program, first using the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>
interpreter that was installed on the BIOS and was invoked if you didn’t put a
diskette inside, and then using some of the BASIC variants that ran on DOS such
as BASIC.COM,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC">GWBASIC</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_BASICA">BASICA</a>. So for better
or for worse, BASIC was my first language.
</p>

<p>
I’ve neglected programming for a long while and just played games on the
computer, and possibly did some work on it. However, I returned to programming
when I was in the 9th grade, this time on a 386 SX with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBasic</a> which came with
some later versions of DOS, and later on with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B">Borland Turbo C++</a>
3.0, which used a much more primitive variant of C++ compared to today’s
flavours. Despite knowing C and C/C++, I still found QBasic useful, due to
my ability to rapidly develop code in it (what Larry Wall later called
“whipuptitude” in some of his talks.). I also may have dabbled with Excel’s
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications">Visual
Basic for Applications (VBA)</a> before I graduated from high school, and
during my 10th grade, I learned some Pascal using Microsoft QuickPascal on
DOS.
</p>

<p>
After I graduated from high school, I worked at three firms. In some of them
I've done C or C++ development on Windows, but I also studied some
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>, and
became familiar with some
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">UNIX</a> flavours
and with <a href="http://perl-begin.org/">Perl 5</a> and the UNIX shells. UNIX
has been an epiphany for me: until then I used DOS and Windows, and considered
them bad, but did not know what a good system is. UNIX was the first genuinely
good system that I have encountered. I also fell in love with Perl, and it
became my favourite language.
</p>

<p>
By the time I started studying in the [% Technion %], I had a relatively early
distribution of

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "text_editors" title = "Which text editors are you using? What is your favourite text editor?" %]

<p>
Well, I'm usually using gvim (the Gtk+/GUI version of
the <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> programmer’s editor) for coding and
for writing purely-Latin texts. For bidirectional (mixed Hebrew+Latin / etc.)
texts, I sometimes use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_%28text_editor%29">Kate</a>
instead, with a fallback on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedit">gedit</a>. Sometimes, I use “vim”
(the console version) or neovim's nvim for quick edits or when I cannot or
would prefer not to use a GUI editor.
</p>

<p>
The reasons I am using gvim instead of vim, are:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Because many terminal emulators on Linux, including Konsole which is my
preferred one, mess up with the Hebrew/Latin bidirectionality too much (enough
to confuse vim).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Because the syntax highlighting looks nicer there.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Because the mouse support is better.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Because I like and use the menubar.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Because Unicode characters are often
displayed better.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Because it does not start much slower than Vim.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
If the console-based Vim works for you - feel free to use it.
</p>

<p>
Regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a>: from what

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "why_xml" title = "Why are you still using XML?" %]

<p>
With the advent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>,
and similar formats such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a>,
some <a href="[% base_path %]humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=two-kinds-of-fools">hipster</a> geeks have proclaimed that XML-based grammars no
longer have any legitimate use. However, while I use JSON and YAML for
many tasks, I still find XML (and <b>some</b> related technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook">DocBook 5</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath">XPath</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELAX_NG">RELAX NG</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a>) of use. Part of the reason for that is that XML can be
used to add markup to a substring of the text, e.g.: like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a">&lt;a&gt; element</a>:
</p>

for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-expressions</a>.
However, I think it
is a moot point, because we can encode and decode them both to/from a binary stream of 0s and 1s,
JSON, or most other syntaxes. Syntax, while often considered marginal, is nevertheless important, and
I don't think I'll enjoy writing text documents completely using <a href="https://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/90q2/lispcode.html">S-expressions</a>.
I also recall reading about a new programming language that allows mixing and matching both lisp-like code and XML code.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
In addition, note that I sometimes use <a href="[% base_path %]open-source/resources/text-processing-tools/">template systems or similar tools</a>
to generate XML documents, and documents in other formats.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Now, with respect to <a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/computers/web/choice-of-docs-formats/">HTML 5, the Markdowns and AsciiDoc</a>,
while I use them sometimes,
they are less structured and more errorprone than many XML grammars,

I can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a>,
Python, or similar, to convert XML to XHTML5 anyway, whether directly
or indirectly. And I often do.
</p>

<p>
Finally, note that I also use some custom formats such as

The word "Hacker" can mean several things. It can mean a computer intruder,
in which case, see <a href="#help_me_crack">the question above</a> - I
am certainly not one. Otherwise, it can mean a clever and competent enthusiast
of a certain field of endeavour, primarily used by and for computer workers, but
not limited to them. As <a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/hacking_and_amateur__vs__conformism_and_professional.xhtml">I note</a>, by inspiration
from other sources, hacking is at least several millennia old.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, a "hacker" is something that normally other people call you rather than
something you call yourself. I aspire for excellence and continuous improvement
in several fields of endeavour (including software development), but only other
people can judge whether I am indeed a hacker of them. And my policy is to

This is what <a href="https://www.producingoss.com/en/development-cycle.html#release-number-even-odd-strategy">the "Producing OSS" book calls "The Even/Odd Strategy"</a>. Quoting from it ( <a href="https://www.producingoss.com/en/copyright.html">under CC-by-sa</a> ):
</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.producingoss.com/en/development-cycle.html#release-number-even-odd-strategy">

<p>Some projects use the parity of the minor number component to
indicate the stability of the software: even means stable, odd means
unstable. This applies only to the minor number, not the major or
micro numbers. Increments in the micro number still indicate bug
fixes (no new features), and increments in the major number still
indicate big changes, new feature sets, etc.</p>

<p>The advantage of the even/odd system, which has been used by the
Linux kernel project<a href="https://www.producingoss.com/en/development-cycle.html#ftn.idp3103" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[78]</sup></a>
among others, is that it offers a way to release
new functionality for testing without subjecting production users to
potentially unstable code. People can see from the numbers that
"2.4.21" is okay to install on their live web server, but that "2.5.1"
should probably stay confined to home workstation experiments. The
development team handles the bug reports that come in from the
unstable (odd-minor-numbered) series, and when things start to settle
down after some number of micro releases in that series, they
increment the minor number (thus making it even), reset the micro
number back to "0", and release a presumably stable package.</p>

<p>This system preserves, or at least, does not conflict with, the
compatibility guidelines given earlier. It simply overloads the minor
number with some extra information. This forces the minor number to
be incremented about twice as often as would otherwise be necessary,
but there's no real harm in that. The even/odd system is probably
best for projects that have very long release cycles, and which by
their nature have a high proportion of conservative users who value
stability above new features. It is not the only way to get new
functionality tested in the wild, however. In
<a class="xref" href="https://www.producingoss.com/en/stabilizing-a-release.html" title="Stabilizing a Release">the section called “Stabilizing a Release”</a> we will examine another, perhaps more common,
method of releasing potentially unstable code to the public, in which
the release number is further marked so that people have an idea of
the risk/benefit trade-offs immediately on seeing the release's name.</p>

<p>
<b>The reason I forbid my children to use words like "fuck" and "shit" is not that I want them to seem innocent, but because these words are ill-mannered and contribute nothing to communication.</b>

<p>
If these words didn't serve a purpose, they wouldn't exist. One of their purposes is to express strong displeasure. It may be ill-mannered to be constantly expressing strong displeasure, but there are cases when it's warranted.
</p>

<p>
I would not consider someone ill-mannered for saying "oh shit" when told that their house had just burnt down. I wouldn't consider a drill instructor ill-mannered for saying "what the fuck do you think you're doing?" to a recruit on a firing range who inadvertantly pointed his weapon at another person. In these situations, "dear dear" (the alternative my parents taught me) would be insufficient-- it would be inaccurate.
</p>

<p>
Here's a thought experiment you can try to examine your motives. Is there any situation in which the idea of your children using these words would not seem repellent? There are probably moments of strong displeasure in everyone's life. So if you dislike the idea of your children using such words regardless of the circumstances, then probably you do, in fact, simply want them to seem innocent.

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "pc_porn" title = "What do you think about Porn?" %]

<p>
Every person has an inalienable right to expose his or her body in private,
and to allow people to photograph it, paint it, describe it, etc. Sexual
activity is also similarly acceptable. Claiming that porn should be illegal
or illegitimate undermines both the right of free expression, and the right of
a man or a woman to their body.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the choice of artwork that a person decides to experience in his
free time, is of no concern to the Peace and Justice in a Liberal country, and
should not be enforced. Only when a person exhibits destructive, harmful, or
unethical actions (whether due to influence of artworks he consumed or not),
then he may be prosecuted.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, I find most 'hardcore' porn disgusting and disturbing, but still
think one should be allowed to produce it, distribute it, and experience it.
Some of the greatest artists in history produced pornographic or erotic
artworks.
</p>

<p>
Finally note that what constitutes pornography is a matter of taste: having
sex, nudity, topless, scantily clad (bikini/etc.). I recall that one day
I visited a local (Ramat Aviv Gimel) restaurant, whose co-owner is/was
a religious Jew. A woman approached us and told us that she publishes an
independent newsletter and brought a sampler. Anyway, the co-owner objected to
a photo of a fully-clothed woman, which the two of us saw there, and which
although attractive, I didn't find too sexualised.
</p>

<p>
I don't look down on people like that, because you have to draw the line
somewhere. As a possible analogy, the github-markdown-toc project
requires the contributed code to only use POSIX-defined features. So when I submitted
<a href="https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc/pull/104/">a pull-request</a>, I used POSIX-compatible awk code rather than /usr/bin/perl5 or python3.

As a general rule, while I often enjoy viewing photos of women in bikinis, or
lingerie, I dislike those of topless or naked women. Or at least those with
visible private parts. A friend of mine and I once discussed what he called

He noted that it was prevalent among Jewish men.
