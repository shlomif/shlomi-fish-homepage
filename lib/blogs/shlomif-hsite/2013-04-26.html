Here are the recent updates for <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi
Fish’s Homepage</a>.

<li>
<p>
There is
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/The-Earth-Angel/">a new story</a>
titled <i>The Earth Angel</i> which I have started to write:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Dr. Alan Stein (Attn.) did not see that side of Samantha before. As they sat
there in the Chinese restaurant, two days before Ari, their system
administrator left for a trip to Israel, Samantha was emitting a lot of
profanity, and sharing her frustrations of her life and the world. Dr. Stein
was beginning to regret the fact that he agreed to comply with Ari’s wishes,
and invite her to lunch with them.
</p>
<p>
Samantha Rodriguez was the newest hire at Alan’s law firm - a brilliant
attorney in her early thirties, who looked great, was always groomed,
and got a lot of work done, despite the fact that she almost never stayed
overtime, and also took many days off. One fly in the ointment was the
fact that she was single, sexy, and kept asking her co-workers out on dates,
or accepting their own invitations. As much as Dr. Stein agreed that she had
been a good hire, he was desperately trying to avoid interacting with her.
</p>
<p>
“Anyway, I ended up telling my friend, Jasmine, who can be a really bitch
sometime, to fuck off, and deal with her troubled life herself. I simply
ran out of patience.” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Bravo!” Ari said while clapping his hands. “By the way, Samantha, how did
you become a lawyer?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that's a long story.” she said while playing with her fork.
</p>
<p>
“And we’ve got time to hear it, right Mr. Stein?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I guess we do.” Dr. Stein answered.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I studied Linguistics as my B.A.,” Samantha said “and by the time I
graduated, my
head was filled with vocabulary to a lesser extent - grammatical rules, my
heart was broken from many heartbreaks, and I didn’t know what to do with
the rest of my life. I ended up narrowing it to three options: 1. Find
a paying job - as a programmer or whatever else I could land. 2. Stay in the
academia, studying for a Masters and/or a Ph.D. and — 3. Go to law school.
I figured out fuckin’ Med School was never my thing.”
</p>
<p>
“Anyway, after consulting it with my friends, I became even less capable
of knowing what to do. So I did the logical thing - I rolled a die.”
</p>
<p>
“A die?” Ari said.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, a <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-sided_die" xml:space="preserve" shape="rect">ten-sided die</a>or a 1d10 in role-playing game parlence, that’s usually what I use. It landed
on the law school, so that’s what I decided to pursue.” Samantha said.
</p>
<p>
“So, you placed your fate in the hand of chance?” Ari asked
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I did. Nothing wrong with doing, if you ask me.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, everyone say you are an excellent attorney.” Ari noted.
</p>
<p>
“So they do.” Samantha said, “Maybe they are right.”

<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/"><i>Summerschool
        at the NSA</i></a>, subtitled “As the
sling shoots, grown-up men will sob”, is a screenplay, which I completed and
is in a usable condition. The Hollywood
actresses Sarah Michelle Gellar (of Buffy fame) and Summer Glau (of xkcd
notability) conspire to kick the ass of the NSA (= the United States
government’s National Security Agency), while using special warfare
that is completely non-violent:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p> [ Black screen, SMG’s (= Sarah Michelle Gellar’s) voice, while emulating her daughter.  ]
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">SMG:</strong> Humpty dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty dumpty had a great fall. And all the
King's horses, and all the King's men could not put Humpty together again.
</p>
<p>
[

</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Stops laughing.]</span> Oh my God, Sarah, your daughter’s so smart.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">SMG:</strong> And… funny!
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Yes. Well, what does she like aside from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Goose">Mother Goose</a>?
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">SMG:</strong> Oh, she loves <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic"><em class="italics">My Little Pony</em></a>. She and I watch it almost every week
together.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Wow, you're a pega-sister, too?
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">SMG:</strong> I'm not addicted to <em class="italics">My Little Pony</em>. I swear! I can quit any time.
Just let me watch one… more… episode. <span class="inlinedesc">[giggles]</span></p>
<p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Hah, hah. For your information, my My Little Pony addicts’ support group
meets every second and fourth Saturday of the month, and I am currently at step
five of our twelve step program.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">SMG:</strong> Sounds like a plan. I'll consider joining.

<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Freecell-Solver-Enterprises-Acquires-Google-Inc/">“Freecell Solver Enterprises™ Acquires Google Inc.”</a> -
a breaking news story published on 1 April 2013:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>1 April, 2013, Tel Aviv, Israel:</b>
Due to the spectacular commercial success of Freecell Solver Enterprises™’s
<a href="http://fc-solve.blogspot.com/2010/03/01-april-2010-freecell-solver.html">Enterprise Edition</a>
and its
<a href="http://fc-solve.blogspot.com/2011/03/freecell-solver-goes-webscale.html">Webscale™ edition</a>,
we have amassed quite a bit of cash in the bank, so we decided to make
a small but important strategical acquisition. As a result, Freecell Solver
Enterprises™ is proud to announce its upcoming acquisition of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google Inc.</a>, which
will result in an exciting synergical merger.
</p>
<p>
Some of the upcoming changes would be replacing Google’s tech support
(which is notoriously bad) by Freecell Solver Enterprises™’s world-famous and
superb tech support (as detailed in the essay
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html">“Seven
    steps to remarkable customer service”</a> by Joel on Software), as well
as integrating Google search into
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver™</a> for an
enhanced experience in solving Freecell. We are also planning on creating
a separate YouTube top-level category for card Solitaire-related videos
(including screencasts and presentations).

There are some
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#empowering_youth">new
sections</a> in my essay
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/">“Putting
all the Cards on the Table (2013)”</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
During the Middle Ages, the apprentices of craftsmen graduated to become
masters, and started their own shops, at a much younger age
than 18. Today, most people graduate from high school at that age,
and are expected to remain disadvantaged until then. There isn’t a
good reason why the youth of today should not be able
to make useful contributions to arts, sciences, philosophy, and
entertainment, despite their young age and inexperience.
</p>
<p>
Here are some examples:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Dmitri Gaskin is a core developer of both jQuery and Drupal
and gave a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mwKq7_JlS8">talk
about jQuery on Google Tech Talks</a>, while being 12 years old.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Maria Aragon was 10 years old when she was recorded performing
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG0wi1m-89o">a cover</a> of
Lady Gaga’s song “Born This Way”, which has received over 50 million
views on YouTube as of April 2013 (and which I like better than
the original).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Much previously,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith">Samantha Smith</a> changed
the fate of the cold war, when being 10 years old, by the simple act of
writing a letter.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In the 18th century,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss">Carl Friedrich
Gauss</a> started making important contributions to mathematics from a very
early age.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Our contemporary culture sort of expects kids (what Americans refer to as
children, “pre-teens”, and “teenagers”) to remain “innocent”, naïve and
inexperienced, and immature, and, as a result, most of them behave accordingly.
