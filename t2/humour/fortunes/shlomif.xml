                    The prefix “God Said” has the extraordinary logical property
                    of converting any statement that follows it into a true one.

                <p>A Jewish Deduction</p>

                <p> The Bible dictates that “Thou shalt not seethe [= cook] a
                    kid [= young goat] in his mother’s milk”. To avoid any
                    possibility of breaking that regulation, the Jewish
                    tradition ruled that it also applies to female goats, to
                    mature goats, and to the meat and milk of two completely
                    unrelated goats. It is also forbidden to eat the meat with
                    fresh milk, and it applies to beef and mutton as well
                    (including mixing the milk and meat of two different
                    beasts). Finally, chicken, which are incapable of milk
                    production, may not be eaten along with any mammal’s milk
                    either.  </p>

                <p> We are fortunate that most mathematicians were not Jewish.
                    Otherwise, it would have been forbidden to divide by all
                    numbers between -1 and 1.  </p>

                <p>“Oh,”, one of them said to me, “their number is growing geometrically. When I checked two weeks ago, their number was 2,148,763. A week ago there were 4,278,109 forbidden writings. Now there must be about 8,600,000 ones.”</p>

                <p>Suggested Improvements to the Documentation:</p>

                <p>The WYSIWYT project was for a long time fascinated by
                    Microsoft’s tremendous desire to advance its Internet
                    Explorer web-browser. We saw the fact that they switched
                    the help systems of the upcoming Windows 98, as well as
                    Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0, to HTML a major step in advancing
                    our project.</p>

                <p>As a complementary step, some of the chief heads of our
                    project suggested that the Windows’ manuals themselves, as
                    well as all of Microsoft’s ads, will be designed in HTML
                    and printed after being rendered by IE4. While this project
                    is in the preliminary and planning stages, we expect it to
                    acquire a large momentum soon.</p>

                <p>I know I’m blond, but I have to colour my hair brown, so
                    people would not think I’m stupid. Because, like the title
                    of the book says: "You’ve only got Three Seconds".</p>

                <p>Actually, since Amazon sent us two books like that, you’ve
                    only got six seconds.  </p>

<sarcasm>
Sure I did. I sat at one point of an IRC channel, and someone
tested me. Eventually it was discovered that I am a computer, but it
turned out the other side was an Eliza program. Strangely enough, I could
not detect that the latter fact was true.

Judging by IRC or AOL, randomly would do just fine ;-)

                <p>&gt; Thanks, applied as change #22936.</p>

                <p> And thank you for applying this patch. But to be honest,
                    I’m a little disappointed. I expected it won’t go in so
                    easily and will trigger some discussion here. But there was
                    none. No typo corrections (“you mis-spelled
                    ‘floccinaucinihilipilification’”); no flames ("this patch
                    is the worst thing since non-sliced bread"). Nothing.</p>

                <p> Someone should do something about it. This direction is not
                    healthy for p5p. Seriously.</p>

                <p>[Commenting in Slashdot after Arnold Schwarzenegger’s
                    decision to use open-source software in the California
                    government:]</p>

                <p>&gt; This is obviously because Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are
                    girly-men. </p>

                <p>Yeah and what are the offerings of the open-source world?
                    Let’s see: </p>

                <p>1. Linus Torvalds - Looks like a dweeb, ergo is a dweeb. How
                    girly is that?  (plus his wife can kick ass better than
                    him) 2. Richard M. Stallman - a hippy. How girly is that?
                    3. Eric S. Raymond - a nice looking man with a mustache.
                    Baby faced, so he looks a bit girly to me.  4. Larry Wall -
                    a cross between Linus and RMS (i.e: a hippy dweeb) that is
                    even more girly. </p>

                <p>So who do we have left? Alan Cox? OK, he’s manly. (huge man,
                    huge facial hair, etc.) And all the others are so neglible
                    people don’t even know how they look like. </p>

                <p>Note: this comment may have been a bit cruel, so sorry.
                    Don’t take it too seriously, especially if you’re one of
                    the guys I laughed about. I hold you all with the greatest
                    respect. Seriously. </p>

                <p>The first phrase that should be taught when teaching a new
                    language is how to say “Do you speak English?”.  </p>

                <p> The first thing that needs to be taught when teaching a new
                    computer tool is how to exit it.</p>

                <p>The bad thing about hardware is that it sometimes works and
                    sometimes doesn’t.  The good thing about software is that
                    it’s consistent: it always does not work, and it always
                    does not work in exactly the same way.</p>

Are you kidding?

CVS is not advanced as:

1. Microsoft Visual SourceSafe - the only sane choice for good data integrity
and portability.

2. tarballs/zip-files and patches. This one excels in convenience, and
robustness.

CVS is a very advanced version control system, however. I do wish that
Subversion (which is a VCS that I have to use against my will) was as good as
it is.

                <p>Hi Omer! Mazal Tov on Chen and yours marriage. It reminds me
                    of a quote from Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre:</p>


                <p>"At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
                    clergyman, an excellent man, <b>almost worthy of such a
                        wife</b>) to a distant county, and consequently was
                    lost to me."</p>

                <p>Well, in your case I can say that both of you are almost
                    worthy of each other.  Congrats again!</p>

                <p>A few weeks ago, I’ve been to Freenode’s #perl, talking to
                    merlyn and other guys, when we got to discuss the Biblical
                    "Tower of Babel Myth". As it turned out, the commonly
                    perceived interpretation was not the one most scholars find
                    as more sensible, which is the one we ended up being taught
                    at Junior High School. </p>


                <p>What most people think is something like that: </p>


                <blockquote>
                    <p> The people spoke to each other in the same
                        language, concentrated in one place, and decided to
                        build a tower high enough so they can reach God. God, a
                        small dwarf who lived in the sky, was afraid of the
                        efforts of these people, because he feared they’ll
                        reach him. So he casted an 8th level Spell of Language
                        Fragmentation, caused these people to speak in
                        different tongues, and without being able to understand

No. 1 is true, naturally. No. 2 is not true - I know LISP but I prefer Perl.
Other like Python, etc. The reasons I don’t prefer LISP are:

1. The standards of Common LISP and Scheme don’t define anything practical.
2. LISP is at the moment incredibly verbose.
3. As Larry Wall noted, all LISP code comes in parenthesis and so it all looks
the same. (Perl is the exact opposite in this regard).
4. I cannot make heads nor tails of serious LISP code. Many LISPers create so
many macros and use them along with regular LISP code, so you keep having to
refer to the previous definitions, and make a lot of research to get you
started.

SICP Scheme is easy and fun. But serious LISP code can take too much time to
understand. OTOH, recently I had little problem reading the source code of
other Perl programmers, and extending it or fixing bugs. (likewise for
Python).

                <p>A few days ago I joined #mandriva on Freenode trying to get
                    to the bottom of a problem I have with KMail at work, where
                    I cannot start KAddressBook from inside it. I asked my
                    question and soon afterwards received:</p>

                    <li>One Thunderbird recommendation.</li>

                </ul>


                <p>The problem is that I wasn’t interested to learn about
                    alternative E-mail clients, and just wanted to get my
                    problem solved. And in GMail’s case it was completely out
                    of the question due to my work’s constraints. </p>

                <p>I recently had to figure out how to do something with wget:
                    get everything below a directory on the web-server, without
                    following links to outside it. So I logged in to FreeNode’s
                    #debian channel, where there are many knowledgeable people
                    to ask it. The first answer I got was "RTFM". So, I read
                    the wget man page, but could not find it there. Eventually,
                    after telling people that it would be faster to give an
                    answer, I got a reply ( add the -np -r flags). But this has
                    been the last straw. </p>


                <p>I composed my own acronym. Just like RTFM is "Read the
                    Fabulous Manual" and STFW is "Search the Fabulous Web",
                    then JATFM is "Just Answer the Fabulous Man". It means that
                    it’s usually faster to answer someone’s question than to
                    ask him to RTFM, which is just going to annoy him. I think
                    the RTFM mantra has done a lot of damage in the UNIX/Linux
                    world, and I hope JATFMing would prove to be a more healthy
                    ideology. </p>

I don’t suppose we should propose that as an alternative to Perl Gods, there
should at least be Perl Saints:

http://www.stallman.org/saint.html

Of course, I’m not sure what being a Perl saint would imply. Using nothing but
Perl? (Including not C in which perl 5 is written?)

Oh well.

Not that I mind the Perl Gods stereotype stuff.

        Shlomi Fish (a Perl saint^W hero wannabe, but definitely
        not a Perl God)

I almost feel honor bound now to start a noise band called The Randal
Schwartz Condition.  I could shout his rants into a microphone while
the rest of the band flogged a newbie live on stage.

                <p>I often wonder why I hang out with so many people who are
                    so pedantic. And then I remember - because they are

                <p> &lt;monty-python&gt; </p>



                <p> A: You Linux kids are so lucky. When we were using Windows
                    95 and Windows 3.11 it kept getting stuck and we lost all
                    our data. We had to reboot it.  </p>



                <p> B: You used Windows 95! Lucky Bastard! When I was your age,
                    we used DOS on CGA screens, and we were lucky if we had 4
                    colors, much less a true windowing environment.  </p>



                <p> C: You had DOS with graphics? Lucky bastard! When I was
                    your age, I used VT-100 terminals connected to a VAX. 128
                    characters should be enough for everybody?  </p>



                <p> D: Visual Terminals? When I was your age, we used teletypes
                    on a PDP-11: the computer printed on paper - very slowly.
                    Can you imagine cat’ing a really long document?  </p>



                <p> E: Teletypes were heaven compared to the punch cards that I
                    was using. Imagine going over to the computer with a large
                    amount of punch cards and then dropping them all.  </p>

                <p> F: Punch cards! What is this talk about punch cards? We
                    input machine code directly using buttons and LEDs.
                </p>

                <p> G: And all <b>we</b> had were NAND gates!  </p>

                <p> &lt;/monty-python&gt; </p>

                <p> <b>Kilmo:</b> why would you like to make fun of the
                    crypto world ? ;) The NSA does know what you did last
                    summer.  And by putting this on the web, they know that you
                    know.  </p>


                <p> Which may lead to interesting philosophical issues. BTW, in
                    a conference I was attending we were given a sticker
                    saying: "NSA - free email backup".  </p>


                <p> They still have some issue with the retrieval procedures,
                    but besides of that  - they are quite a trusted service.

                <p> <b>Kilmo:</b> Yep. but this is a world-wide service that
                    they offer. (Along with several cooperations, like MI5/6).

                <p> Richard M. Stallman (RMS) decides to release his brand-new
                    editor, "Emacs" on the CPAN with its first version
                    29.999.99.  In order to package it, he invokes the trusty
                    ol’ module-starter (see
                    http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Starter/) which creates
                    a skeleton of a CPAN distribution for him.  </p>



                <p> He fills in the skeleton with the actual code of Emacs,
                    types "perl Build.PL", and "./Build test" and makes sure
                    all the tests pass. Then he types "./Build config --gui"
                    and gets a nice GUI to configure the various parameters of
                    the Module meta-data.[M-B-Data] </p>



                <p> In the GUI, Richard goes to the Trove categorisation tab,
                    and selects categories. This is done in a similar way to
                    Freshmeat’s project categorisation dialog (a list of
                    options to the left, with selected options to the right and
                    arrows to move them left or right, while allowing multiple
                    select options.).  He chooses such categories as
                    "Programming Language :: Lisp", and "Intended Audience ::
                    Emacs Users", "Operating System :: GNU", and "Topic ::
                    Editors". (Note: I believe the category list should be
                    fetched using a public web-service to keep them
                    up-to-date.) </p>

            <body>


                <p> After several weeks of having the editor on CPAN, Richard
                    has received many patches, and wrote a lot of code on his
                    own. Now Emacs is not only an editor but a calendar tool,
                    an Eliza program, a web browser, a mail user agent and many
                    other things.  </p>

                <p> So in order to release version 30.000.00 he needs to update
                    the categorisation.  He runs ./Build config --gui again,
                    and adds more categories. However, he enters too many
                    categories (because Emacs now does them all), and the GUI
                    refuses  to save the file because it will overflow the
                    limit that the web-service specified the CPAN
                    classification services allow to handle. So Richard keeps
                    only the important categories, adds more tags, and saves
                    it.  </p>

                <p> He then tests the distribution again, and uploads the new
                    distribution to the CPAN.  </p>

                <p> Bill Gates, CEO of Microsoft decides to use Richard
                    Stallman’s Emacs as the basis of his company’s
                    state-of-the-art product Microsoft Editing Macros™
                    Enterprise Edition XP .NET Professional. However since MS
                    Editing Macros™ is a commercial, proprietary program which
                    he intends to sell at computer stores, Bill is not going to
                    upload it to the CPAN. He builds upon Emacs, sends patches
                    to  Richard and learns a lot about it.  </p>



                <p> When he’s finished building Microsoft Editing Macros™ he
                    surfs to the Emacs homepage on CPAN, and adds some
                    categories and tags of his own.  </p>



                <p> Eventually, enough people like Bill tag and categorise
                    Emacs, and it gains more classification.  </p>

                <p> Well, it’s not a threat - it’s a warning, and he won’t be
                    harmed much by acting against my advice. A threat is
                    something like "Stop posting political posts or I will burn
                    your house, rape your wife and daughters, banish you to the
                    middle of Antarctica, convert all your Perl code to PHP, and
                    then post it on thedailywtf.com."
                </p>



                <p> Regarding what you say that "no one cares if you
                    unsubscribe", then this reminds me of what Fred Brooks says
                    in "The Mythical Man-Month": "How does a project becomes
                    late? One day at a time.". If you’re not careful, you might
                    lose a large percent of your blog’s readership, one
                    subscriber at a time.
                </p>

                <p>PHP error debug list:</p>


                <p>1) did you use the correct argument order? if you’re a good
                    programmer, use the *reverse* from what you think it is.
                    see if it works. no? you’re not a good programmer, or you
                    learned php’s braindeadness and can go on to step 2).</p>


                <p> 2) did you think about your code? if so, don’t. php will do
                    it for you so you can do mindbogglingly stupid stuff, such
                    as not escape the data that goes into your sql queries.

            <body>

                <p> Mike “The Mouse” House (a.k.a “D.J. Salinger”) was a minor
                    rap artist, and a computer geek when he decided to start
                    selling CDs of open-source software.  He turned to spamming
                    to publicise his business, but found out that the spam he
                    sent was trapped by most spam traps. He decided to use the
                    notorious obscured image spam, but since he had a few blind
                    friends, decided to also include an audio recording of a
                    rap song with the spam message.  </p>



                <p> House received a few offers from his spam campaign, but his
                    real break came when a few enthusiasts of the spam song
                    shared it on the Internet, where it became an instant hit.
                    The song eventually hit the charts and MTV, and made D.J.
                    Salinger famous, who quickly released his first successful
                    album called <i>Rap to the spam, Ma’am!</i>, with such
                    highly acclaimed hits as “Rap to not get trapped” and “He
                    ain’t Nigerian. He’s a Spammer!”.  </p>



                <p> As a millionaire, House decided to donate some of his money
                    back to sponsoring open-source projects, and has donated
                    100,000’s of U.S. Dollars to such causes as <a

                        href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</a>.
                    “If it hadn’t been for them, I wouldn’t have made it big”,
                    he said, and said he’s now working on a second album with a
                    similar theme.  </p>

            <body>

                <p> All languages of the world suck. If you require people to
                    declare variables (like in Pascal, C, <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29">Scheme</a>
                    or Perl 5 with <a
                        href="http://perldoc.perl.org/strict.html">strict</a>),
                    then people will tell you they like variables to spring up
                    upon first use. Without variable declarations, then you get
                    various weird side-effects of the implicit scoping. If you
                    use curly braces for scoping, then you’ll have to type more
                    and there’s more clutter. With indentation-based scoping
                    (like in Python), you’ll find it hard to introduce
                    multiple-expression <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#First-class_functions">lambdas</a>.</p>

                <p>Rob Pike and Paul Graham hated object oriented programming
                    (OOP) and so they didn’t introduce it in their <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29">“Go”</a>
                    and <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_%28programming_language%29">“Arc“</a>
                    languages, well after OOP has become mainstream. And guess
                    what? Many people, including me, think that OOP is still a
                    good thing (and no, in my opinion, C++ did not do OOP very
                    well) and so gave up on Arc quickly and did not look
                    closely at Go.</p>

                <p>Dynamically typed languages (like Perl 5, Python, Ruby, or
                    Lisp) possibly suffer from many subtle errors&#160;;
                    Statically typed languages (like Haskell) are less
                    expressive and it seems that about one third of the
                    language design papers published on <a
                        href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/">Lambda the
                        Ultimate</a> are about various funky extensions to the
                    Haskell type system to allow for better expressiveness.</p>

                <p>Purely functional languages have no assignment and most
                    people find them harder, in part because the world around
                    us has a lot of state, and they also need to do funky
                    compiler tricks to make you feel like you don’t need
                    assignment. Non-functional languages have side-effects and
                    so are prone to many errors.</p>

                <p>If you have goto or goto-like statements (such as exceptions
                    or Perl 5’s “last LABEL;” (more like “break” in C) or
                    “next LABEL;”), then you encourage code to not be factored
                    correctly. If you don’t have such stuff, then programmers
                    will hate you for having to go through many hoops to write
                    quick-and-dirty code.</p>

                <p>Perl 5 has a dedicated regular expression syntax which is
                    treated magically by the parser. PHP and Java use strings
                    for them, and require weird escaping and backslashing rules
                    to interpolate the sub-regexes inside them. And if you
                    incorporate a first-order syntax for regular expressions,
                    then people will want similar first-order syntaxes for
                    XPath, for XML (like some recent versions of Visual Basic
                    .NET have), and for all other grammars you may need to
                    embed.</p>

                    facilitate the so-called “interpolation” (= embedding

<saying who="linuxguy101">rindolf: yes..  down to 2 or 4 colors..  steve balmer in a cocaine brain storming meeting with the developers decided to move to a gui that was un pattoned so they invented retro..  simple and stupid colors a 4 year old child could barely read or draw</saying>
<saying who="linuxguy101">he called it retro</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Retro.</saying>
<saying who="linuxguy101">clearly a first in computing history</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Now I get the joke.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Metro is Retro.</saying>
<saying who="linuxguy101">oh it is no joke.. just wait for windows 8 lack of sales prompt stever balmer to shove it down into the updates for windows 7</saying>
<saying who="linuxguy101">on a side note, did you know that linux is becoming more popular now days?</saying>
<saying who="linuxguy101">i dont know why..</saying>
<saying who="linuxguy101">rindolf: you really should try windows 8</saying>
<saying who="linuxguy101">at least virtual box it..</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">linuxguy101: maybe I should, but I&#39;m not going to shell out money  for the experience.</saying>
<saying who="linuxguy101">Warning!: using windows 8 may cause massive hysteria, laughing and vomiting in some cases..</saying>
<saying who="linuxguy101">the first time i used windows 8 i laughed uncontrolably for several hours and almost wet myself</saying>

<saying who="srogers">work, mostly</saying>
<saying who="srogers">&quot;one of those days&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Work.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I&#39;m enjoying my unemployed status.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And after all that hospital thing is behind me, I&#39;d like to go to tau.ac.il and set up some events where I read from my writings/etc.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">To gain some esteem.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I contacted an Israeli publisher about publishing some of my stories and/or essays, but they didn&#39;t return to me after more than a month (which is their designated limit).</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And after reminding them on the phone, I gave up.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, I&#39;m not going to sit idly and expect recognition to come to me.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Maybe I&#39;ll use some of my Project Wonderful money to gain some publicity.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I could try publicising some of my works on various sites such as http://www.calamitiesofnature.com/</saying>
<saying who="srogers">Yeah - promote yourself</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">srogers: yes.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">srogers: I  think that was the main mistake of Howard Roark in The Fountainhead.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">He should have worked more on publicity.</saying>

<saying who="mrout">Who likes freedom?</saying>
<saying who="mrout">FREEDOM</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: freedom++</saying>
<saying who="Younos">just give me my beer</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Younos: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">No beer for you!</saying>
<saying who="Younos">aww :o(</saying>
<saying who="mrout">I’m in non-freedom mode atm actually, using Windoze</saying>
<saying who="mrout">for teh gamez</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: OK.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">but when I restart into Linux I respect the freedoms of myself and others</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: OK.</saying>
<saying who="Younos">you should respect it regardless of the platform</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: maybe try reporting it as a bug in WINE/etc.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: the GNU project encourages FOSS developers to port their software to  non-free platforms.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Though there was a small backlash about it (at least for Windows) a while ago.</saying>
<saying who="alfplayer">encourages?</saying>
<saying who="mrout">rindolf: I sure hope it does. if we can encourage users to try FOSS software on non-free platforms, they might more easily learn about FOSS and about how to protect their freedoms</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/download.html - I provide a Windows binary for this. :-)</saying>
<saying who="mrout">Many users don’t even know they can get software that respects their freedoms.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">alfplayer: well, don&#39;t know if encourage, but it doesn&#39;t hold a stand against it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">alfplayer: and a lot of GNU software can be built fine on Windows (And proprietary UNIXes).</saying>
<saying who="alfplayer">rindolf: that&#39;s very different imo</saying>
<saying who="alfplayer">rindolf: yes, like gcc and emacs</saying>
<saying who="mrout">btw is rms ever on here? He gave a talk at my local university a few years ago, and I never got a chance to talk to him.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=should-perl-drop-sco-support - also see this.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">lol</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: I don&#39;t think he uses IRC.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: he also doesn&#39;t use a graphical web browser.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: though he does read the web sometimes.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">rindolf: i haven’t installed X yet, so neither do I. haha</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">He commented on a few pages on my site.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">When he visited Israel, I told RMS that I felt making Freecell Solver Public Domain (now it&#39;s MIT/X11L) was appropriate given its target audience, and he said he thought making it GPLed would encourage more users of programs that used it to make them FOSS.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">He also said it was OK that freshmeat.net (now freecode.com) did not release their backend as free software.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: ah.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">freecode.com?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: well, I think he doesn&#39;t even use links or lynx or Emacs&#39; www-mode.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: yes.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: they changed their name and domain.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">who are they? NEVER heard of them</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: http://freecode.com/ - it&#39;s a nice way to discover some interesting software.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: they are a web-directory for UNIX software.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">do they host it?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: no.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">quite unlike something like github, then?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: just link to it.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">cool</saying>
<saying who="mrout">will try to remember that</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: also see http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Freecell-Solver/slides/freshmeat_effect.html</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: not everything there is FOSS.</saying>
<saying who="mtjm">http://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html explains his Web use</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: and not everything is there.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: but I try to publicise most of my major software there.</saying>
<saying who="mtjm">IRC would need a constant network access which is difficult when travelling (and needs much mor e time than batch mail writing)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, most of the software published there is either niche or quite boring.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">rindolf: Freecell Solver on freecode is the first result</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: for what?</saying>
<saying who="mrout">that google search</saying>
<saying who="mrout">I fail to see a problem</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: well, thing is there are other Freecell solvers.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: and what I said is that I clog the search.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">Oh, I see what you mean</saying>
<saying who="mrout">that’s a good thing for you, though</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: lots of junk like FreeBSD/Debian/Ubuntu/Mandriva/Mageia packages.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: that&#39;s what I call the freshmeat effect.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I get http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/ as the first hit. :-(</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Damn bubbling.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=freecell%20solver - here (no bubbling) I get the wikipedia Freecell page as a first hit.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">rindolf: bubbling?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: http://dontbubble.us/</saying>
<saying who="mrout">I get NZ results</saying>
<saying who="mrout">hahaha</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: NZ?</saying>
<saying who="mrout">rindolf: where are you from?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: Israel.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">New Zealand.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: but shlomifish.org is hosted in hostgator.com .</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I used to host it in a small Israeli hosting provider but they were too unreliable.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">I asked, because i expected it to be US, and so I’d say “I know what US stands for, but you don’t know what NZ stands for? Shame on you.”</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: I know that .nz is New Zealand.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: but didn&#39;t understand the initialism in the context.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: some Americans think .il is Illinois.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And .ca is California.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, there&#39;s also .la.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">ahh</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And .tv.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">haha</saying>
<saying who="mrout">tv? that must be for tezdikistan. &gt;.&gt;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: no.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.tv</saying>
<saying who="mrout">joke</saying>
<saying who="mrout">that was a joke</saying>
<saying who="mrout">I know it’s not for television stuff lol</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuvalu</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">.tk domains are free.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">yeah</saying>
<saying who="mrout">Woo tokelau</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">wonders if there is .fs.</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">There should be a country called .if so I can register shlom.if</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Someone registered shlomifi.sh. ;-)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Not me, though.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">https://www.google.com/search?q=.lf - no .lf either.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">We need more countries.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">I wish there was a .ut</saying>
<saying who="mrout">so I could get mro.ut</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, I can register shlomif.name.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">I already have rout.co.nz (that’s my dad’s actually) and rout.geek.nz (mine)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: ah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Are top-level .nz domains available?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">like rout.nz</saying>
<saying who="mrout">you can’t get milesroutisawesome.nz, no</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Ah.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">or rout.nz &gt;.&gt;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">OK.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">.il domains are kinda costly and they used to require faxing.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And I don&#39;t feel my domains are particularly Israeli-related.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">ahh</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, I originally got shlomif.il.eu.org.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">But its DNS was flaky.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">.eu.org?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">So I ended up buying shlomifish.org</saying>
<saying who="mrout">what’s your actual name?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Now I also have shlomifish.com</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout:  Shlomi Fish.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">Ahh</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: eu.org is free DNS.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">But I guess you get what you pay for sometimes.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: it&#39;s not .eu (European union).</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: http://eu.org/</saying>
<saying who="mrout">that site’s odd</saying>
<saying who="mrout">what’s wrong with .eu</saying>
<saying who="mrout">shit a brick, they want a separate ccTLD for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Martin_(France)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: nothing is wrong with .eu - it&#39;s just that eu.org is something different.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">eu.org predates .eu.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">ahh</saying>
<saying who="mrout">it annoys me that the US doesn’t use .us more</saying>
<saying who="mrout">and clutters .com</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, there&#39;s also .gov, .net, .org...</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">.mil</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">.navy</saying>
<saying who="mrout">exactly</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: I also have http://shlom.in/</saying>
<saying who="mrout">it’s pretty americo-centric</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Could not get http://shlom.fi/ because my domain registrar did not have it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">shlom.in is my own custom (and private) URL shortener.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Some overzealous spam filters blocked it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Ah, domains.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">The bread and butter of Internet conversations.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">lol</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I know someone who has http://ali.as/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, from the Internet.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And there&#39;s also cr.yp.to which is Dan Bernstein.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">DJB.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">domains, vim vs emacs and hello_there vs helloThere.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">cr.yp.to is cool</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: and tabs vs. spaces.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">but hard to type</saying>
<saying who="mrout">eugh</saying>
<saying who="mrout">cr.yp.to is hard to type</saying>
<saying who="mrout">spaces, vim, hello_there or HelloThere, but never helloThere.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Since I have http://perl-begin.org/ and want to create a site for Vim beginners, I should get a good domain.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">vim.perl-begin.org or vim.shlomifish.org does not look good.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">vimschlomfish</saying>
<saying who="mrout">lol</saying>
<saying who="mrout">shlom</saying>
<saying who="mrout">vimshlomfish</saying>
<saying who="mrout">what about vim-begin.org?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: maybe I&#39;ll get tech-begin.org</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I think begin.org is already taken.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">yea</saying>
<saying who="mrout">by one of those shitty domain hoggers</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Heh. begin.tel is available. \o/</saying>
<saying who="mrout">i’d love mil.es</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Not that I want it.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">begin.tel?</saying>
<saying who="mrout">begintel?</saying>
<saying who="mrout">$17/yr for mil.es</saying>
<saying who="mrout">YES FUCK YES</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">OK, I registered begin-site.org and begin-site.com</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">On https://www.domainsite.com/ .</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I figured most people won&#39;t &quot;guess&quot; begin-site.net... ;-)</saying>
<saying who="mrout">nice</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">So I&#39;ll have http://vim.begin-site.com/ and http://vim.begin-site.org/</saying>
<saying who="mrout">what about rindolf.com</saying>
<saying who="mrout">begin-site seems a bit clunky</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: rindolf is only my IRC nickname.</saying>
<saying who="mrout">still</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: and I already have www.shlomifish.org</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mrout: I don&#39;t see why most people will STFW for &quot;rindolf&quot; or &quot;shlomi fish&quot; or whatever.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Most of the people come to my site using more generic searches.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=fountainhead%20parody - first hit !</saying>

            <title>Is Buffy Kosher?</title>

                <p>
                    I recall discussing Buffy with a Jewish American friend,
                    who used to be secular, and now has become an observant
                    Jew, and married a woman who properly converted to
                    Orthodox Judaism, and they have some children. We
                    discussed the fact
                    that Sarah Michelle Gellar was Jewish, and yet that many
                    men (and some Lesbian women) were more attracted to Alyson
                    Hannigan’s character, Willow Rosenberg, who was a shy and
                    sheepish, redhead, Jewess. Then when I mentioned that
                    Hannigan was only a maternal Jew, he said she is “kosher”
                    (because someone whose mother is Jewish and who did not
                    convert to a different religion, is a bona-fide Jew). I
                    found it amusing that you refer to women by the same word
                    as you do to food, but I think the ancient Hebrew word
                    "kasher" also means "approved", "appropriate", "legal",
                    etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In any case, both Hannigan and Gellar are now married,
                    and so trying to separate between them and their husbands
                    is not kosher. ;-)
                </p>

                        Selina is passing by and shakes her head in
                        disapproval. The three notice Selina, and
                        quickly run to her.
