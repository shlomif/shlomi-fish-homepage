<latemp_subject "Shlomi Fish’s Art" />

<p>
I dedicate this section to the various pieces of computer graphics I designed
, photographs I took and published here, and computerised music which I
created. I will explain how I created the graphic art, so you can 
shamelessly duplicate my efforts and create similar art.

After I wrote <a href="$(ROOT)/humour/human-hacking/">the story <i>Human Hacking

I found a design I liked, but its images were not suitable, so I duplicated
the effect using <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">the GIMP</a>.
