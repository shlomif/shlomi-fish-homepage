One can execute perl commands inside the debugger. For example, typing
<tt>print $a</tt> at the debugger prompt will print the value of the
<tt>$a</tt> variable. You can also modify the values of variables in this
way, or run functions, etc.

One special command that is also useful is <tt>x</tt>. <tt>x $var</tt> 
displays <tt>$var</tt> in a hierarchial manner, which is very useful for 
lists of lists etc. The <b>Data::Dumper</b> module which is available from 
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> offers a similiar functionality, from
within your perl programs.
