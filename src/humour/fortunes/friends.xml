                            be the guy that breaks up a family, y’know when my
                            parents split up, it was because of that guy.
                            Whenever I would see him I was always think y’know
                            “You’re the reason, you are the reason why they’re
                            not together.” and I hated that guy. And it didn’t
                            matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my
                            Dad.

                            y’know? I mean it’s like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through

                            great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again,

                            an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my
                            pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. O
                            Bleethr ah, or, let’s
                            say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil. That would be the
                            basic “I have a fish-hook in my eyebrow and I like it”.
                            <inlinedesc>Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend fish-hook.</inlinedesc>
                            Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and
