<b>Update:</b> I originally planned to write a book, but abandoned that
idea for various reasons. You can find a <a href="https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/book.html">copy
of the latest draft</a> of the book and <a href="https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/docs/">some other documentation</a>
on the Freecell Solver site
</p>

<p>
Enjoy!
