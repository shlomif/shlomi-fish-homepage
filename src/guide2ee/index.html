<h1>[ DEPRECATED! ] Guide to the Electrical Engineering Faculty's Courses</h1>

<h2 style="color: red ;">NOTE!! This page is deprecated and outdated!</h2>

<p>
Due to the incredibly kitschy, dysfunctional, and non-standards compliant
<a href="http://www.ee.technion.ac.il">homepage</a>
of the Electrical Engineering Department, the site became unusable with many
browsers, and many of the homepages of the courses disappeared from search
engines.
</p>

<p>
I decided to create something which is more usable and hopefully allow
search engines to track the homepages of the courses again. The contents of
this site will be gradually filled with more information.
