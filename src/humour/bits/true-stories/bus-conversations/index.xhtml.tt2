For some time, my strategy when riding the bus has been to try to sit

I am a secular Jewish resident of northern Tel Aviv, Israel.
</p>

<p>
For some time, I had thought that Arab-Israeli girls on the streets were either
wearing the traditional Muslim hair cover, or looked unattractive. Then it hit
me: perhaps the attractive ones who didn't have hair covers, didn't look all
too different from Jewish ones.

<p>
Now, one day I boarded a bus, and sat next to a beautiful girl with black hair.
After a while, I noticed there was text in Arabic letters on her smartphone.
Moreover, looking at her again, she stroke me as looking Arabian, which she
hadn't beforehand!
