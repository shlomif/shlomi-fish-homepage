<p>
One can access the main namespace (i.e, the namespace of the script),
from any other namespace by designating <tt>main</tt> as the
namespace path. For instance, <tt>main::hello()</tt> will invoke
the function named "hello" in the script file.
</p>

<p>
Usually, the "main" part can be omitted and the symbols be accessed
with the notation of <tt>::hello()</tt> alone.
