<h1>IP-Noise Project: Links and Reference Material</h1>

<h2>Tools we can use for the project</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">User-mode Linux</a> - 
a version of the Linux kernel that runs as a standard Linux process. Thus,
it can be debugged with gdb, and the system doesn't hang when there's a 
problem in the kernel code.
</p>

<p>
<b>Writing an IP firewalling driver in user-mode</b> - I was told that
using the Linux' IP Firewalling mechanism it would be possible to write
the entire noise simulator in user-mode. Of course, we should write the code
so it can also be compiled as a module. However, running the whole thing
as user-level will make for an easier debugging.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/kdb/">SGI's kdb</a> - A kernel debugger
from SGI that enables setting breakpoints, examining contents and debugging
kernel code. Should prove useful at the times when we have to work in 
kernel-mode.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://pice.sourceforge.net/">Private ICE</a> - A system-level 
symbolic source debugger for Linux, not unlike Soft-ICE for Windows. Should
prove useful too.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> - An emulator of an i386 that runs
above Linux. We can use it to test experimental kernels without having to 
reboot constantly. There's a free alternative in the making called 
<a href="http://www.plex86.org/">Plex86</a>, but it is still not as complete
or as usable.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/directory/ksymoops.html">ksymoops</a> - In case
OOPS faults do happen (and the kernel debuggers don't trap them) we can use 
this tool to diagnose them.
</p>

<h2>Reference Material</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Linux/maillists/01/07/msg00363.html">
Linux-IL's thread on the subject</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.kernelnewbies.org/documents/ipnetworking/linuxipnetworking.html">
The Kernel-Newbies IP Networking tutorial</a> - contains a packet filter 
example.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">The Linux Documentation Project</a> -
contains some in-depth guides and HOWTOs which may prove useful.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/linuxdrive2/chapter/book/index.html">
Linux Device Drivers 2nd edition</a> - this book is available online
for free, too.
</p>

<h2>Kernel 2.4 Firewalling</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://netfilter.samba.org/">The Netfilter/IP-Tables Homepage</a> 
- contains the most up-to-date iptables package as well as many documents
and stuff for hacking it.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.intercode.com.au/jmorris/perlipq/">Perl-IPQ</a> -
perl bindings for the user-space IP filtering. Good for experiencing.
</p>
