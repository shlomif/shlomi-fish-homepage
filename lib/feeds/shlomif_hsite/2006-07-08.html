<!-- TITLE=Web-site Changes-->
<p>
Well, there were a few new additions to my home site since the last update,
but not enough to warrant a new update. However, I’d like to take this stage
to announce a URL transition and some other meta-changes
</p>

<p>
Some of the pages of the site that used to live under 
http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/ are now living directly under 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">http://www.shlomifish.org/</a>. This 
change was done due to the constant downtime of vipe.technion.ac.il. The
server itself is usually up and running and responsive, but the connection to
it gets down. Other benefits of this are the fact that everything would be 
on one host, which would make mirroring, backup and maintenance easier, and
that there would be less need for absolute links.
</p>

<p>
The pages temporarily moved to http://www.shlomifish.org/Vipe/, but later
were moved to the main site and integrated there. Some things may still be
broken so please <a href="mailto:shlomif@iglu.org.il">report any problems
    to me</a>.
</p>

<p>
The two host scheme stemmed from the early history of the site (when I still
had a relatively limited quota on the Technion’s students’ servers), and
ended up influencing the design and feature-set of some of the projects to
support this site (like 
<a href="http://web-cpan.shlomifish.org/latemp/">Latemp</a> and
<a href="http://web-cpan.shlomifish.org/modules/HTML-Widgets-NavMenu/">HTML-Widgets-NavMenu</a>).
</p>

<p>
Other meta-changes include:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
The removal of the PayPal donate button and replacement with a much less bloated
(markup-wise) 
<a href="http://localhost/sites/hp/shlomif/meta/how-to-help/">link
to the new “How to Help” site</a>.
</li>
<li>
The Google search box is now placed in the navigation bar on every page of the 
site, rather than just the front page. I hope people will find it more
convenient to search the site using it.
</li>
<li>
I should also note that I added
<a href="http://localhost/sites/hp/shlomif/philosophy/computers/web/create-a-great-personal-homesite/#note_to_readers">a note</a> to the beginning of
my “Create a Great Personal Homesite” article addressing some 
“The Disqualifier Disqualifies on his own fault” criticisms of my home site, by some people whom
I referred to the article.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I’d like to make another post to this feed soon, this time more interactive 
and asking for some advice regarding the current form of the site. So stay
tuned.
