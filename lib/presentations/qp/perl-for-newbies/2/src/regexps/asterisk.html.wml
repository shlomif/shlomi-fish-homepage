<p>
In order to repeat a character more than one time several repetition
paterns can be used. The asterisk (<tt>*</tt>) can be used to indicate that
the character should repeat zero or more times. The plus sign (<tt>+</tt>)
can be used to indicate that the character should repeat one or more
times. As for the question mark (<tt>?</tt>) it indicates an appearance of
zero or one time.
</p>

<p>
The following pattern <tt>/ab*c/</tt> matches "a" followed by as many
times of b as we like and then c. The pattern <tt>/you k?now/</tt> matches
both "you know" and "you now". The pattern <tt>/hello +world/</tt> matches
the word "hello" followed by the word "world". (with some whitespace in
between).
