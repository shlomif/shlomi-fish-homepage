This is my favourite movie, and the favourite of a lot of others from
my generation. It has an excellent dialogue, with many power sentences. The
acting is excellent, and the film is very enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
The Princess Bride has the format of a classic fairy tale, but with a few
interesting and non-ordinary twists. It is funny, engaging and highly
recommended.

    Spaceballs is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Essentially a 
    parody of Star Wars and other Science-Fiction films, this films features
    Druish Princesses, merceneries who "don't do it for money", but rather
    for "a shitload of money", an old small alien guru who claims that you
    should "never underestimate the power of the Schwartz".

<p>
    I've seen this movie several times, and have either enjoyed it, or found
    it disappointing alternately. But the first time is a blast.
