<p>
I, <a href="$(ROOT)/">Shlomi Fish</a>, am willing to mentor newcomers with their
first steps into the world of contributing to
<a href="$(ROOT)/philosophy/foss-other-beasts/">free and
open source software (FOSS) and free and open content</a>, whether in
<a href="$(ROOT)/open-source/">my own projects</a> or in projects I’m
not directly involved in. By mentoring I will provide guidance into how to
contribute and assistance.
</p>

<p>
Before contacting me, make sure you are serious about contributing and that
you won’t waste my time by asking me for help. If you are, then please
pick a project you’d like to contribute to (it can be any project, but
naturally I can provide more assistance with a project which I’ve been
involved with) and <a href="$(ROOT)/me/contact-me/">contact me</a> via Instant
Messaging, as E-mail is far less effective for that.
</p>

<p>
Until now, all the people who contacted me about mentoring them, have
lost interest after contacting me and failed to produce anything substantial,
but I still have not lost hope.
