<p>
Perl is interpreted, so no compilation is needed. To use perl, one should 
create a text file that contains the Perl program. This file can be written
using any text editor available on your system. It is recommended that
you end the filenames of your perl scripts with ".pl" in order to designate
them as perl scripts.
</p>

<p>
After you are done, you should invoke the perl interpreter with the name of
the file you created. Assuming your file is name "myscript.pl", you should 
type:
</p>


<quadpres_code_block>
$ perl myscript.pl
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
At the command line (and press Enter). If your program contains errors or 
warnings they will be displayed. If your program does not contain errors, it
will be executed.
</p>

<p>
The fact that the program was executed does not mean it does what you want it 
to do. We will learn how to debug Perl programs, later on in this series.
