When I studied in high school in Israel (grades 10→12 ; roughly 15→18 years old
students), the school held an annual music festival. In the 11th grade one
of the performers was a student in my classroom ( “11th Grade No. 5”</span>).
Now he wrote a song where he said that he has a "mask" during many of his
activities,
