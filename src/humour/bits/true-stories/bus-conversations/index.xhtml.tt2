For some time, my strategy when riding the bus has been to try to sit

I am a secular Jewish resident of northern Tel Aviv, Israel.
</p>

<p>
For some time, I had thought that Arab-Israeli girls on the streets were either
wearing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab">Hijab</a>, the
traditional Muslim hair cover, and often looked cute — or did not and looked
unattractive. Then it hit me: perhaps the attractive ones who didn't have hair
covers, didn't look all too different from Jewish ones.

<p>
Now, one day I boarded a bus, and sat next to a beautiful girl with black hair.
After a while, I noticed there was text in Arabic letters on her smartphone.
Moreover, looking at her again, she struck me as looking Arabian, which she
hadn't beforehand!

Seems like God is playing tricks on me.
