<p>Welcome, this page is dedicated to the Linux Community's greatest
ambassadors, Gentoo users. Like the annoying teenager next door with a
90hp import sporting a 6 foot tall bolt-on wing, Gentoo users are proof
that society is best served by roving gangs of armed vigilantes, dishing
 out swift, cold justice with baseball bats to those fucking ricer
bastards.</p>

<p>Please note, these quotes are real. I didn't bother to link to the
original quotes because it's too much work and this page is mostly an
amalgamation of different things that I've found on the web. Besides, we
 all know people like this, if you spent 6 hours compiling X, you'd like
 to think it was for something useful right? You can't make this shit
up, we're not kidding. People like this are <em>real</em>. While <a href="http://greenfly.org/mes.html">some pages</a>
 attempt a more practical look at a Gentoo user's behavior, we're not so
 lenient. Most of these quotes come from the Gentoo forums themselves or
 from slashdot.</p>

<p>We've bolded things that are just so ludicrous that you need to sit down to read them.</p>

      <h1 id="first">--omg-optimized</h1>
      <h2>The true ricer spirit lives on.</h2>

<p><a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=74072">HOLY COW I'M TOTALLY GOING SO FAST OH F***</a></p>

<p>"I am going to try to squeeze another 6% out of my system. It's the
fact that you know your system is about as optimized as it's going to
get. Also, my old Athlon Xp 1500 smokes most of the 2.0Ghz+ boxes.. And
that's what it's all about."</p>

<p>"The performance gained by CFLAGS on x86 is minimal at best -- largely because the machines are still basically <a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104437">overclocked 386's</a> at their core."</p>

<p>"Why in the hell are using software compiled for a 386 on a Pentium 4 class machine?"</p>

<p>"There are so many steps involved in tweaking the last uumph out of
your linux system- and it really is a work of art to pull it off- I have
 used many different kernels and all sorts of optimization
combinations-yesterday I finally used -noatime and -notail for my
reiserfs file system: The single biggest performance boost I have yet to
 see-now I can have gnome2.2 running using gnome-terminal to compile the
 latest j2sdk from source (nice -n 19)while browsing with mozilla while
running e17 in a seperate login with two eterms and run Unreal
Tournament at full speed (this with an apache webserver running for my
dyndns pseudo-domain and a mysql for my answering-machine software for
my isdn card-which keeps track of all incomming phonecalls and manages
my telephone book app and ntfsd/sshd/dhcp server/squid)..."</p>

<p>"its -O3 the letter, not -03 the number"</p>

<p>"I love building all sources from scratch, then it will be optimized
and made to run smooth for MY machine. as Debian normally uses binary
packages, yeah dependencies crap may happen, that's odd, you might as
well just switch to pure source base distro, right."</p>

<p>"I notice that my disk does a whole lot of thrashing when I boot up. I
 have a lot of stuff that gets loaded into memory every time I boot,
like X11, ion2, Firefox, Eterm, Thunderbird, etc. It seems to me that
putting all of the files necessary to those apps in a contiguous section
 on the disk and loading that into memory in one shot would be a whole
lot faster. Is there a way to do this? Is it stupid?"</p>

<p>"I use Gentoo because I'm a speed freak - I can't stand the thought
that some of my packages might not be running as fast as they could be."</p>

<p>". . . and I liked the idea of running an entire system that wasn't compiled for a 386."</p>

<p>"Without a doubt, Gentoo has set itself apart from every other distro
 out there. Because it's source-based, it's notorious for its speed.
Because of emerge, it's notorious for being simple to maintain."</p>

<p>Yea, I really don't understand all the complaints about the time to
install gentoo. It is like complaining about your Ferrari because the
dealership was so far away.</p>

<p>"I find it suprising no one has mentioned the fact that Gentoo the
only mainstream distro that uses gcc3 for everything. That's what
brought me to Gentoo in the first place."</p>

<p>"If Debian people think compiling sucks, well so what? I guess
they're satisfied with Someone Else's Binaries. I prefer to play on
Gentoo's strengths. I get exactly what I want compiled in -- nothing
less, nothing more, and with the optimizations I want."</p>

<p>"Yet, binary distros are riddled with bugs, and are much more
annoying to fix given the the cumbersome edit/build package/install
package cycle."</p>

<p>"As a Gentoo user what really stands out to me is that this test was
clearly biased away from Linux. If the reviewers had been serious they
would have used an optimised distributions such as Gentoo, which would
have taken far fuller advantage of the extra 32bits in each register to
provide a much fuller experience, more than any current Linux
distribution possibly could. It really saddens me to see that people go
out of their way to spend so much money on such expensive hardware and
then squander their investment by running barely suitable software on
it. To me, an extra 0.1% performance increase, even if I am only
imagining it to be faster, is certainly worth one day a week recompiling
 all of the latest packages from source code. Even if I do occasionally
get my CFLAGS in a muddle! I think I speak for Slashdot when I say that
Gentoo is the only sane option for getting the most from your hardware!"</p>

<p>"And what about Gentoo? I think that this is the best distribution to
 run on a 64-bit processor. Perhaps the test needs to be reworded to
"without any manual recompiling" and then redone. Compiling all your
software yourself, optimized for your processor, gives you a great speed
 boost. I think this is one major advantage where Linux excels in
comparison to Windows."</p>

<p>"Personally, I can tell a difference between my Gentoo install and my
 previous Red Hat install. What's the deal with these people? He can't
possibly be right..."</p>

<p>"I know how much everyone here loves optimized software. This is why I
 was surprised to read today on the GNOME mailing list that Ubuntu is
taking advantage of some optimization opportunities that I think Gentoo
is missing out on."</p>

<p>"It's easy to work with and we can do a custom install with no XFree86 or other stuff that we don't need or want on the system."</p>

<p>"Gentoo is much more optimized in my opinion, it has more support,
benefits any hardware circumstances, and runs at at least 20% faster
than Red Hat."</p>

<p>"Having said that, it looks like the guys doing the testing got their
 CFLAGS wrong. Gentoo's performance should never be worse than Mandrake
-- I reckon they forgot omit-frame-pointer."</p>

      <h1 id="second">--USE-flags</h1>
      <h2>Real Gentoo users understand, it's not about OPTIMILAZIATIONS, it's about USE flags.</h2>
	  <img src="_files/purple.jpg" alt="The wing helps KDE run faster" />

<p>"The simplest difference between gentoo and binary distros is NOT
that you compile your own. That is just a side effect. What is far more
important is that you have the CODE, or rather more importantly, the
HEADERS! If you EVER tried to compile a package yourselve on a binary
distro you will have found that you first have to download a ton of
headers, wich are often out of date, or you are using some weird binary.
 Simply put, if I want to compile a package on gentoo on my own I can do
 so by JUST compiling the package, I do not first have to download the
package with the linux headers for my kernel, because the headers, and
everything is already there."</p>

<p>"But if you happen to pick some junk PC/Sparc/Apple and would want to
 put it to better use, you soon would find that only flexibility of
Gentoo allows you to make something real out of the junk."</p>

<p>"Another example is that you might have a dual core system, while the
 binaries of a package that are available were specifically intended for
 uniprocessor machines. If someone else has written multiprocessor
patches, or you can write them yourself, you can then recompile the app
to get full dual core support."</p>

<p>"Say the binary package you're going to install is unsigned, but you
*are* able to get signed, checksummed source. The prudent thing to do in
 such a case would be to download the secure source and compile it
yourself, rather than installing an unsigned and potentially compromised
 binary on your system, thus possibly exposing yourself to back doors."</p>

<p>"I would rather spend a day compiling X and KDE on my system when I
know that it has been built with everything that I need, rather than
installing a package that has been compiled with every option and have
unnecessary dependencies cluttering up my system."</p>

<p>"Oh please, for the love of jebus, tell me you don't think that is an
 actual valid CFLAGS setting. You undesrtand that -march implies -mcpu
right? I sure as hell hope so."</p>

<p>"People, I am the only one who realise that <strong>binary packages are almost useless</strong>?
 Except a few basic packages (as in USE independent, e.g. gcc), the
result depends greatly by the USE variable. Let's take for example the
mod_php package. How useful a binary mod_php will be?"</p>

<p>"I totally concur. USE flags are the technical feature of Portage
that brought me here from Debian. The political reasons are described
here."</p>

<p>"Compiling from scratch is really hyped, what makes Gentoo cool is the technical merits like rc-updating and USE flags."</p>

<p>"I still have nostalgia for Debian. I wish it had optimization for
i686. I wish it had "USE" flags or "rc-update" features. But it
doesn't."</p>

<p>"USE variables. These things are so cool. I don't have a printer at
home, so I USE -cups. Boom, nothing wastes space on my computer or pulls
 in stupid dependencies by compiling in optional printer support. I
don't think this would be even close to feasable on a binary distro.
Everybody (espescially that Debian mailing list thread) seems to get
stuck on CFLAGS, but USE is the real winner. "</p>

<p>"At this point I realized exactly how nice Gentoo is-the USE flags makes things sooooo much easier. In all <strong>I needed over 8 hours to get my SuSE distro up</strong>
 and running multimedia-and this with the help of a webage dedicated to
to getting mutlimedia stuff up and wunning with SuSE- If I had had to
download the source of each of these files and manually do every step
involved this would have taken me at least twice as long, i.e more time
that was involved in the installation and compilation of Gentoo."</p>

<p>"I buy cars with turbos, I take out the old turbo, insert a new
bigger fatter one, I make sure my chip is up to date and I charge that
turbo with higher pressure then recommended. I get the fattest rims and
accessories I can affoard.I want cutting edge and I hope gentoo keeps
balancing stability with cutting edge. See I like the freedom that
gentoo will provide me with. Instead of saying "my way or download it
yourself", they say "my way or just simply unmask it or make your own
ebuild etc".</p>

<p>Hyped? Yeah, just like some people still are calling the internet a
hype. Good things are supposed to be hyped, the problem is when complete
 crap get's hyped, and I'm sure we can all say that gentoo is one of
lifes good things. To me gentoo represents freedom, I'm free to choose
if I want a stable system or if I want to optimize things. The day there
 is something that gives me more freedom and that is better in every way
 then gentoo I will use that. But since the community seems scatterd
with very bright people I doubt that it will happen anytime soon.</p>

<p>See, I can work on my car for weeks to get a little more torque, so
by choise sacrificing (keeping GRP in mind) some time to compile my
system just the way I want it, to me is a treat. My image reflects who I
 am, and I feel that gentoo's best advantages is not a single system,
such as portage, but the actual mentality behind all the development. In
 that aspect gentoos image reflect who it is, and how it is going to
develop in the future.</p>

<p>The gentoo-mentality is what is behind the creation of such a great
community, portage, use-flags and all the nifty new things that will
come to us, the greatfull users. The main reason to why I'm using gentoo
 is because I indentify with the gentoo mentality, I feel secure in that
 with a good culture behind the scenes, it will spread and be visible to
 anyone using the product (or process as someone prefered to call it)."</p>

<p>"Sure, the extra 2% you gain from optimizing for your CPU is nice,
but that's not main the reason to use Gentoo. It's about control. I have
 two words for the anti-Gentoo critics: "use variables". That's the
power of Gentoo, being able to choose whether or not you want to install
 all of KDE just to get arts, or whether you want to enable gnome
support in Abiword. <strong>No RPM-based distro can do that</strong>."</p>

<p>"What is it about Gentoo that people value in a Web server? It may
seem crude to ask that question, because by itself Gentoo Linux is one
of the most advanced GNU/Linux distributions available."</p>

<p>"That was the first decent review I've seen of Gentoo. One thing that
 was not emphasized specifically was USE flags.  This is one of the main
 advantages of Gentoo. You get the binary you want because you compile
the options in that you want, all through one easily configurable
/etc/make.conf file."</p>

      <h1 id="third">--fuck-upstream</h1>
      <h2>Gentoo is in the true open spirit of Open source and helps developers more than other distributions.</h2>

<p>"So you'd have the Gentoo people who want to optimize their <a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/13/220">iPod access times</a> by 0.2% by raising the maximum sector number - good for them!"</p>

<p>"The idea that I should fix a package I didn't create for an OS I
don't use is laughable. That you still don't understand how *you* need
to communicate with *us* about this, since I can't keep tabs on every OS
 packaging <a href="http://www.sacredchao.net/quodlibet">QL</a>, is sad. If I just make an ebuild later and <a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101619">dump it here</a>, the <a href="http://piman.livejournal.com/358460.html">problem</a> isn't solved at all."</p>

<p>"As Gentoo users are generally an <a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35890">annoying nusiance</a>
 in my IRC channel, I would like to be able to set a +b on
*!gentoouser@*, in order to keep them out.  In order to accomplish this,
 I would like Gentoo to set the default username to something Gentoo
specific."</p>

<p>"I've seen an .ebuild of a program of mine in Gentoo without a
build-dependency on glib (while my program heavily depends on it) for
months and nobody noticed. That's not exacctly what I consider good
packaging."</p>

<p>"I think what I like most about Gentoo is that it's much more bazaar-like than other distributions."</p>

<p>"There is something very appealing about a distro that is so
source-code driven (for lack of a better tem). It embodies all the best
things about open-source software."</p>

<p>"As has been pointed out to the author of the relevant "advisory"
several times, Mozilla has neither a "local zone" nor "predictable cache
 file locations". The author assumed that the random string generated
for his cache file location was the same as everyone else's. I wonder
how Gentoo can have fixed, QAed and tested the fix for a vulnerability
which doesn't exist?"</p>

<p>"Gentoo does help stop programmers from being lazy, so they write
completely airtight code. That can only be a good thing, whichever way
you look at it."</p>

<p>"I am a long time Gentoo user, so take what I say with a grain of
salt, but I believe that as hardware gets faster, it makes sense to
migrate to a largely source-based Linux system. <strong>Binary packages
encourage inconsistency and incompatibility, whearas source encourages
unified development frameworks and integration</strong>." [I just want to say, that is the best quote I've ever heard, wonderful stuff. -ed.]</p>

      <h1 id="fourth">--teach-me-unix</h1>
      <h2>Watching shit scroll by for hours makes me a Linux expert overnight!</h2>
	  <img src="_files/headlights.jpg" alt="Built for Servers" />

<p>"Usually when you pull in a sec fix it's usually just a jump between
distro-provided revisions (package_foo-2.1-r1 to package_foo-2.1-r2) so
config files don't normally change either. Frankly, the practice of
backporting fixes is not appealing to me. If upstream decides the change
 is big enough to warrant a new version, well, y'know, it's their app,
they should know. <strong>Backports are a good way to accumulate cruft.</strong>"</p>

<p>"Gentoo is the perfect development system, gentoo is the only system
that doesn't miss any support for any program language! I mean support
on a way you do not to be original with an installation."</p>

<p>"Gentoo requires a compiler, Python and many tools not necessary and
even dangerous for servers. But then, even Gentoo itself, calls itself a
 Meta-distribution."</p>

<p>"Personally Gentoo is the only Linux I'd use on a server, while it
takes time to get installed correctly and I need a staging server to
test major changes on, I feel it is the single most secure OS simple
because I install what I need and nothing else, and other Linux install
wans to and requires crap (sound anyone, sound on a server what the
hell). I'm reminded of a version of Suse (old version of Suse) that
wanted a menstruation calender as part of the server install (explain
that). Gentoo is for the truly savvy installer only, but it is the only
of for a truly minimal yet fully functional server install (think MC or
screen, most servers do install them by default)."</p>

<p>"Why *SHOULDN'T* you put a production server on gentoo? I mean, THOSE
 things should perform REALLY well, and gentoo is just the thing that
does that..."</p>

<p>"Especially if you're a newbie to linux (I wasn't, but I like you,
was certainly no master). Following the installation guide that gentoo
provides was a very educational experience for me. Not only does it tell
 you step by step what to do to get your system up and running, it tells
 you WHY you're doing it. I was very impressed with the instructions."</p>

<p>"I started using Gentoo on the desktop and now I've rolled it out as a
 production server using some great technologies: ReiserFS, RAID-5,
Gentoo patched kernel, Samba ... you name it."</p>

<p>"If you're an experienced admin, and not all people are, Gentoo is
easy to admin, update, and as stable as any commercial OS. Sure that
sort of flexibilty can make it easy to tank your OS, just like a manual
transmission makes it easy to wreck your gears. On the otherhand that
sort of flexibility can make a number of admin and support tasks easier.
  Like all engineering it's a trade off."</p>

<p>"I myself used to use Mandrake on several servers, without really
understanding Linux. I made it work. I got by. Only with Gentoo was I
able to make the leap to the desktop, and the laptop. And not only make
the leap, but understand the system from top to bottom. If I had to, I
could now invent my own LFS system, built entirely from source. Only on
Gentoo can you find a learning curve that, however gradually, reaches
such heights."</p>

<p>"The USE flags and all gentoo ideas are really great, but the real
problems of gentoo when it comes to enterprises is a lot of software big
 players won't support gentoo as os... <strong>Think about having an Oracle database or DB2 or a SAP R3 system on gentoo</strong>,
 even on stable gentoo... Gentoo is more educational than mainstream
distros. It encourages you to look under the hood and effectively turns a
 lot of n00bs into l33ts."</p>

<p>"About 30 computers. I'll be having a few other people help me, maybe
 3 or 4 others. We'll be doing manual installs as far as I know at this
point in time, but I still have some time to think it through."</p>

<p>"Hilarious. I did notice your last statement about no serious
business considering Gentoo was not funny because it is not true. I do
happen to know 2 high level network administrators who are very
seriously considering Gentoo for their server farms. They had invested
much time and effort building these systems and now Red Hat is dropping
support and forcing an upgrade. They decided they would like to avoid a
forced upgrade in the future . <strong>Since their time is valuable they are very seriously considering Gentoo</strong> and are evaluting it as we speak."</p>

<p>"When you're installing Gentoo you are *forced* to learn, and you can
 learn much more quickly than with Red Hat or SuSE, where you're not
forced to learn the low-level details of the system. It helps if you
have a friend who can answer your questions."</p>

<p>"I think 10 minutes server downtime once a couple of months (or even
less frequently) due to compiling updates, is not much of an issue.
Other packages can compile while the server is up and running, it
reduces performance, but not for too long as to call it important. At
least this has been my experience."</p>

<p>I think the biggest benefit of running Gentoo is that it's a learning
 experience. I'm pretty good with computers, and managed to install
Mandrake with no problems - but I didn't really know how it did
anything. I did look into Linux from Scratch, but decided that was a bit
 much - Gentoo is a very happy mid point.</p>

<p>"gentoo also approaches the 'moving to linux from windows or mac'
ideal in a very different way from something more like RH or MDK. I used
 both before gentoo simply because i'd heard of them and not gentoo at
the time. I could install them, assuming it automatically detected all
my devices. And i could usually follow their GUI configuration programs.
 But the second i hit a wall or there was a bug in the GUI, i was
completely stuck. i realized i knew just about nothing about linux.
gentoo on the other hand teaches you many important tools and a lot
about the interal workings of linux. the documentation is far superiour
to anything RH or MDK or slackware or windows ever offered me (i've no
experience with macOS). now, when i have a problem, i know what to do,
and how to correct it (i must admit, i've had far fewer problems because
 i knew what i was doing and the install was for my machine, not 100,000
 generic people's computers). only gentoo could have offered me that."</p>

<p>"Daniel went on to say that using Gentoo on the customer servers is a
 mixed experience; while it's easy to use and maintain, and the
customers who prefer Gentoo are generally more knowledgable, it does
take a long time to install."</p>

<p>"Gentoo is not a hacker's toy; it is a professional's tool. Let's
hear from some people who use Gentoo in production environments -- we
already know it makes a good custom desktop. What else do you use Gentoo
 for?"</p>

<p>"The Gentoo install system taught me more about *NIX in the course of
 a few days than three years of other distros did. I fell in love
instantly. It didn't hurt that I could FINALLY build binaries tuned for
my CPU, while other distros were much more 'generic'."</p>

      <h1 id="fifth">--time-records</h1>
      <h2>Published time records from the truly moronic</h2>

<p>"You will notice that even with that crazy MAKEOPTS=-j256 you won't
be able to use your cores to the max. With the latest Xeon I was just
able to make each one of my 8 cores work at 27%, having all of my cores
sleeping at 73%!!! [...] I don't know but having xorg-x11 compiled in a
few seconds instead of hours is enough to make me think this -j256 does a
 good job."</p>

<p>"I'm running GENTOO on many servers under very strange conditions
(DoS...) and It performs MUCH FASTER than ANY OTHER Linux distro or
FreeBSD."</p>

<p>"The server were were using was a Xen slice on a dual-core Opteron,
and the initial compile/install time was extremely fast (a couple
hours). MySQL compiled and installed within 15 minutes. The resulting
system using the CFLAGs for that dual-core ran at least twice as fast as
 another slice we had Ubuntu running."</p>

<p>"I'm currently isntalling Gentoo from stage 1 on 300Mhz laptop with
128 megs of RAM. And the compilation is not an issue. That guy sounds
like he plans to do all the compiling during the time he would normally
be using the computer. Why not do like I did? I started the bootstrap
when I was on my way to bed. In the morning, it was finished. Before I
went to work, I emerged system. When I got back home, it was done. X and
 Fluxbox were both installed during the night, no problems there. I
didn't lose any time compiling all that software."</p>

<p>"as it turns out, on my computer it took 13 hours to get kdebase. if
you have a long list of use flags (including the ones in
make.conf.defaults) you can get a long compile. likewise some CFLAGS
will speed up compile time and others elongate it. unless the program is
 only used sparcely, like genkernel, i'd reccomend staying with at least
 -O2 for optimizations."</p>

<p>"thanks all! nice to know I'm not crazy and so its not a joke. i
started emerge kde days ago now and its still going, I used -03 -pipe
-fomit_frame_pointer accepted whatever was the default USE."</p>

<p>"A full install (stage1) with Gnome can be done in a day on an
athlon-xp, provided you start in the morning and really know what you're
 doing (ie know exactly what you want in each of the configs, and
exactly which packages to merge)."</p>

<p>"I'm stuck with a 400MHz PII on a dial-up connection; it's just too
slow. I first tried starting from stage 1, but when I found the
bootstrap was still compiling after ten hours, I decided to try a
stage-3 install instead. (I was just evaluating it; it wasn't going to
be a permanent installation, so who cares if it was optimized?) But even
 then it took over three hours for the kernel sources to download, and
my ISP cuts you off after an unpredictable interval, so the download
failed around 94% complete."</p>

      <h1 id="sixth">--disable-instructions</h1>
      <h2>People who think Gentoo rules because they can't use RPM properly</h2>

<p>"Try installing some cool app you read about in a magazine on SuSE or
 Red Hat.. First you have to find RPM's and hope they are compatible with
 your various libraries. Most of the time, there is a lot of sweat and
tears trying to figure out why it ISN'T working."</p>

<p>"Another problem of the stable linuxes is that you have everything
working but when the distribution goes on to the new version there are
numerous changes leading to a quite complex upgrade process of the
distribution and the services of the user. Inccompatibilitys, etc are
only found at this update and will cause a lot of work, and thus will
lead to a lot of errors."</p>

<p>"However I still find gentoo's philosophy appealing. I keep a
mandrake system as a home server since 2002, which has been rendered
obsolete for some years now and cannot be upgraded to a newer version
unless you re-install it from the beginning. This for example as far as I
 know could not have happened with a gentoo system."</p>

REQUIRES will be updated. That is the key here. In a binary distro, you
would be stuck because that would break everything in your system that
depends on that dependency lib; but with Gentoo, you only need to do a
revdep-rebuild."</p>

<p>"i've run Red Hat, suse, and gentoo servers and i can assure you that
updating a profile is much less error prone than update some packages in
 a Red Hat server. i've had more problems with Red Hat system failure
after a global system update than gentoo.
yeah gentoo is time consuming, and it requires you to be careful. not
for all the push-button servers lovers :)"</p>

<p>"I've occasionally questioned my use of Gentoo on my servers, but
each time I come back to Portage. No other distribution lets me control
with such a fine grain what goes on my system. No other distribution
offers the wealth of packages Gentoo does. Other distributions might be
easier to administer, day to day, but they do this by hiding from you
things that I actually use."</p>

<p>"The beauty of Gentoo is that you can create and entirely custom
environment for any particular task. In the enterprise world servers
tend to be very specialized. This is the point at which distributions
like RH, Debian, etc. fall flat. Compiling everything into packages that
 *most people need is just not adequate. I never had a RH LAMP setup
that I didn't need to build PHP and/or Apache from sources because it
didn't have critical feature X compiled in that our application
required."</p>

<p>"It's obvious though that you've never 'designed' anything more than
what the mass-market vendors provide you. You would be hopelessly lost
if you needed to design a server farm that provided specific LAMP
features that don't exist in Red Hat Network's stream of apps and
updates. You probably don't even understand that dependencies at a
binary level are BAD, because you don't know that there is another way."</p>

<p>"Binary packages from a server distro will include what you need to
make it work, the way it used in Gentoo is more in an opt out policy
that could be useful security wise but you will rarely miss it. If some
corporate software can use LDAP, i doubt a semi decent distro wont
include that binary package. Debian ain't secure by default and yes a
distro (not an OS) can give you very good security defaults for some
server roles that are well defined."</p>

<p>"Debian is easy to keep up to date. Thats because they don't update it."</p>

<p>"If your business depends on you being at the technological front
edge, (Etrade for example) then you run something like Gentoo or Debian
unstable (Etrade runs Gentoo, but Debian unstable has packages of about
the same age and quality.)"</p>

<p>"Although it's my favourite distro, it can be extremely time
consuming to update and install software, and when you need to update
your kernel, be ready for a day of downtime."</p>

<p>"In fact, I can't even imagine how the developers manage to compile a
 list of so many packages that go together in the first place, I know I
could never manage to do that. And it seems that either they don't use
the same packages as us gentoo folks or they are rather sloppy about
satisfying dependencies. Even after a bit of digging with yum/apt
repositories I still couldn't get mplayer for the life of me. It would
be easier to compile by hand but then what is the point of package
management?"</p>

<p>"I essentially started using Gentoo because my ....ing KDE clock would never show the right time in Red Hat."</p>

<p>"Binary packages are bad! If you don't use your system to compile
itself, it will lose the ability to compile itself.  Huge systems like
gnome, libc etc. are constantly decaying into complexity. Your pain is
necessary, because a fraction of people like you will try and relieve
that pain by improving the system."</p>

<p>"I just switched too Gentoo because I was sick of Red Hat doing stuff
 to my config without me knowing and hogging my memory. I was looking
for something new. I tried Debian once, months ago, when I didn't know
much of linux, maybe that's why it didn't work, but I don't care. I
couldn't even get a stupid X-server installed. Yet I still was looking
for a system which would let me decide myself what I should install and
preferably had something more up-to-date as i386 binaries, so I found
Gentoo, and I'm sticking on it. I'm thinking of installing all the
servers for a lanparty with it, but I'll have to discuss that with
others."</p>

<p>"Main reasons I came to Gentoo were that I wasn't happy with the
technical merits of the RPM based distros and was put off by the elitist
 Debian attitude."</p>

<p>"For me Gentoo is perfect. For you, perhaps not. What is really
strage about Gentoo is this: people who like it or dislike it keep
constantly refering to Gentoo-when in reality we are refering to Linux.
With othert distro's when you have problems they are problems with
Red Hat or with SuSE or with Lindows. But if you have problems with
Gentoo you have problems with Linux. That's because with Gentoo you have
 returned to the source."</p>

<p>"Source based distro historically always = more packages because
there is too much competition between binary distros.  There is simply
no standard Linux binary package. As a result, source based distros like
 Gentoo update their repos sooner because it doesn't require as much
work. Source is source."</p>

<p>Out of all of the linux distros out there, i would say that gentoo takes the least time to mess around...</p>

<p>"Again, I cannot stress enough how much easier gentoo is to me than
Red Hat or mandrake when i tried those, I never figured out what was
broken when something did not work, or what was installed and what not."</p>

<p>"Debian, however, had some obvious and immediate flaws. Binary based
packages drove me crazy. First, I needed a mutt with ssl support
compiled in. Then, I found myself wanting mplayer. Next, I wanted a
mozilla without mail and news compiled in. (I can't stand it when I
accidentally click on a 'mailto' link!) The only solution seemed to be
to compile it yourself, make debs, and install it using dpkg. "</p>

<p>I know that most of you would rather run Windows than Red Hat. This is
 my opinion again, but personally Red Hat runs like crap even on newer
systems. <strong>Stock package management and static binaries may save
time, but in the long run they lower your peak perormance and also make
the system unstable</strong>, and as useless as a used condom. Even
recompiling the kernel on Red Hat causes problmes. Their modern init
scripts interfere with some newer kernel operations.  It takes as much
time to get Red Hat working right as Gentoo. It is time to take out the
trash, and we need to stop supporting pay basis distros such as
communist Red Hat. They are charging us for the stuff thats spose to be
free."</p>

<p>"I tried Red Hat, Suse, and Mandrake on the desktop. If something
didn't work, I had nowhere to turn to understand and fix the problem.
Not so with Gentoo. Why do you think it is that so many users of other
distros are coming here to get their questions answered? This is not a
raw coincidence. It is because so many people here have the answers, and
 a good percentage of them have the answers because they have learned
from the experience of working hands-on with source-code, patches,
kernel config, drive-layout, and the numerous text-files in /etc."</p>

<p>"Quite simply: yes. Yes Debian, you are losing people to Gentoo.
But... Why is this happening? Because you are old, and your stable tree
is older than me. We have Portage, we have a source compilation unstable
 version. We are the cutting edge, and Debian has to realize this. There
 is a hierarchery of distributions, and right now Gentoo is at the top.
There will always be Slackware, because it's always been there. Debian
will remain in second place to the leading distro, and they'll always be
 wondering: "Why? Why are we losing users to (insert distro name here)?"
 Because you don't innovate.  Sure, you're good. But theres usually
something better. Live with it."</p>

<p>"You have these guys that will say "ohh, just add xyz to apt
configuration files and then type this and then type that and then go
here and run this and that. Easy" - but it's not easy and it's not
intuitive. I love how Gentoo is so easy to maintain."</p>

<p>"if you use debian heres a warning (atleast if you enter the debian channel): <strong>dont come in as root, you never hear the end of it,</strong> which was very annoying."</p>

<p>"Speed isn't even the point! Sure, the extra 2% you gain from
optimizing for your CPU is nice, but that's not main the reason to use
Gentoo. It's about control. I have two words for the anti-Gentoo
critics: "use variables". That's the power of Gentoo, being able to
choose whether or not you want to install all of KDE just to get arts,
or whether you want to enable gnome support in Abiword. No RPM-based
distro can do that."</p>

<p>"I have a friend who seemed to claim that Debian's "portage" system
is better or more extensive than that of Gentoo.  How should i go about
convincing him that this just isn't true?"</p>

<p>"What other linux will let you have a vector optimized wordprocessor?"</p>

<p><strong>This one deserves a category of its own:</strong></p>

<p>"I don't think that Debian can really compete with Gentoo. Sure it
might be okay, but when it comes to dependencies, you probably are still
 going to have to get them all on your own. Or is there something like
portage in the Debian world as well?"</p>

      <h2>You're just pissed because my 28 second Honda smoked yuo, lol!</h2>

<p>Looks like we've gotten some <a href="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=181330&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0">attention</a>
 on the Gentoo Forums recently. Good to see people can take a joke and
poke fun. If you're offended, I have a friend who uses Gentoo, and well
... let's just say it's difficult to drink beer with someone who insists
 on building his drink "from scratch" and with "optimized hops", not to
mention, the hot waitress doesn't appreciate his need to know her on a
"low-level, stripped down without the bloat" kind of way.</p>

<p>Of course, this thread has it's own wonderful commentary as well, and we can't just let this slide:</p>

<p>"Binary packaging does encourage sloppy coding/design, contrast with
the stochastic API unit testing which occurs naturally with all the
building with different configurations."</p>
