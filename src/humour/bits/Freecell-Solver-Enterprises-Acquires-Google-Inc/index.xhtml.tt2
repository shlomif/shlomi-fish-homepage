<b>1 April, 2013, Tel Aviv, Israel:</b>
Due to the spectacular commercial success of Freecell Solver Enterprises™’s
<a href="http://fc-solve.blogspot.com/2010/03/01-april-2010-freecell-solver.html">Enterprise Edition</a>
and its
<a href="http://fc-solve.blogspot.com/2011/03/freecell-solver-goes-webscale.html">Webscale™ edition</a>,
we have amassed quite a bit of cash in the bank, so we decided to make
a small but important strategical acquisition. As a result, Freecell Solver
Enterprises™ is proud to announce its upcoming acquisition of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google Inc.</a>, which
will result in an exciting synergic merger.
</p>

<p>
Some of the upcoming changes would be replacing Google’s tech support
(which is notoriously bad) by Freecell Solver Enterprises™’s world-famous and
superb tech support (as detailed in the essay
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html">“Seven
    steps to remarkable customer service”</a> by Joel on Software), as well
as integrating Google search into
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver™</a> for an
enhanced experience in solving Freecell. We are also planning on creating
a separate YouTube top-level category for card Solitaire-related videos
(including screencasts and presentations).
</p>

<p>
We are sure that the upcoming acquisition is going to allow Freecell Solver
Enterprises™ to further its competitive edge, and allow us to have
even more significant growth, which will in turn allow us to make even more
significant acquisitions. As our CTO,
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a>, notes:
“good times are coming.”.
</p>

<p>
Soon, people will say “Let’s Freecell Solver Enterprises™ Superheroic Web
Search™ it!” instead of “Let’s Google it!”, for an exciting
Web 3.141592™ experience.
