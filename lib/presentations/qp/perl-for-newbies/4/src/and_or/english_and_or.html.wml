<p>
Perl supplies two operators <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> which are equivalent
to <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> except that they have a very low
precedence. (lower than any other operator in fact). There's also <code>not</code>
which is the ultra-low precedence equivalent of <code>!</code>.
</p>

<p>
You can use them after a statement to write error handlers.
