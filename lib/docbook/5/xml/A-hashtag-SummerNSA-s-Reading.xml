        <para>
            It is September, 2014 now - the air here in Tel Aviv, Israel
            has been getting cooler, and we are expecting the Jewish
            Autumn holidays (starting from Rosh Hashanah) soon. It seems
            that Autumn has finally arrived.
        </para>

        <para>
            The concentrated #SummerNSA (“hashtag-SummerNSA”) effort spanned
            most of the summer of 2014 for me, and now I’m trying to
            summarise it (pardon the pun). Unfortunately, I have yet to
            hear back either from Summer Glau or the other proposed
            <link xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/cast.html">cast</link> of
            the original screenplay, or from the people inside the
            NSA itself. However, I’ve learned and taught a lot this summer,
            and would like to concentrate many of my insights here, and
            am not giving up on my intention to have a film, in whatever
            format, created.

<para>
(<emphasis role="bold">2014-Sep-07</emphasis>)
Following the <link xlink:href="http://unarmed.shlomifish.org/3001.html">call for
action</link> for “Finishing
Off The Open Content / Web 2.0 Revolution (#SummerNSA)”, I have
become tired of remaining <emphasis role="bold">The</emphasis> Hacker monarch.
As a result, I mentally decided to quit prematurely and let the whole world
go to hell.
This was done per advice of
<link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall</link>,
who was the wonderful The Hacker King of the Open Source/Usenet revolution
(~1984-1997), and quite The Invisible as well (by choice).
</para>

<para>
After feeling vindictive and resentful for a while (which I knew by
experience was a transitional feeling and that I should not act upon),
I realised something. That was that Summer Glau, being the legendary Bajoran
profile,
“The Sexiest Terminator Ever”, just terminated the
whole obsession of me and other people with a small group being
“<emphasis role="bold">The</emphasis> Hacker Monarch” and instead there are now multiple
potential “Hacker Monarchs”. And to that I am grateful to her.
</para>

<para>
(FFFFUUUU <link xlink:href="http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Rainbow_Dash">Rainbow Dash</link>
-like people, who always think there should be one and only winner in a
competition.)
</para>

<para>
Therefore, I plan on remaining <emphasis role="bold">an</emphasis> awesome hacker monarch for the
foreseeable future,
and will be joined by Ms. Glau and by other people who are willing to play
that role. Perhaps future historians will designate some people in particular
as being that in the present, but such global
<link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superlative">superlatives</link>
probably ought to die for now.
</para>

<para>
(Also see how previously
the fictional Selina Mandrake, being The Dispeller
<link xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/ongoing-text.html#from-dispeller-to-selina">dispelled the whole ordeal with assigning profiles</link>.)
</para>

<para>
I still plan on passing that d10 die to Summer in person with much fanfare,
because it's now her property. And I am still planning on becoming a
successful, rich, and famous, writer/entertainer/philosopher and
screenwriter. Remember the name: Shlomi “Rindolf” Fish!

Hi William,

&gt;  Why is the gender or the nationality of the winner significant?
&gt; I would prefer to hear what she did or wrote or discovered to win the prize.
&gt;

First of all, she was the first woman to have won this prize which has been
given for a long time, so it is significant. Part of the problem is that the
prize is given only to mathematicians under the age of 40, which for women is
often a problem because they wish to have a family.

Otherwise, I dislike the &quot;I don&#39;t care about what makes you who you are
attitude&quot;. Like I note in my new screenplay “Buffy: A Few Good Slayers”:
http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Buffy/A-Few-Good-Slayers/ongoing-text.html#faith-s-childhood
:

««««««««
[ Becky and Chankey are sitting in the library, studying together, and
listening to Cimorelli - “When I’m
gone” ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpZddsmoEsI ). Faith approaches them. ]

Faith: Hmm... hi kids! That doesn’t sound exactly like Anna Kendrick.

Faith: Whoa, who are all those girls?

Becky: Oh, they are Cimorelli - six sisters who sing together. They are a big
hit on YouTube.

Faith: Six sisters!

Chankey: And they also have some brothers.

Faith: Heh, God bless their mother. After my third pregnancy (to twins) I said:
“That’s it. No way, José!”.

Faith: I would think their being a big family is part of their charm.

Chankey: Yes, and the way I see it: all the power to them. See: I read 20,000
Leagues Under the Sea as a child, and I ended up memorising the English
translation and now the French original, because I liked it so much.

Chankey: Anyway, Captain Nemo there, thinks he’s a nobody, which is what “Nemo”
means in Latin, but he&#39;s not. Thing is: lots of people expressed interest in
him due to his various distinctive qualities, and he kept thinking: “They are
interested in tangential stuff, not in the real me. They don&#39;t know the real
me.”

Chankey: And here&#39;s the thing: all these qualities are what make you who you
are, and you should exploit them and be yourself.

Faith: Indeed!
»»»»»»»»

There&#39;s more about celebrating individuality in the screenplay and in other
screenplays. So my advice to Ms. Mirzakhani is to be proud of being the first
woman to have won it, and use it as publicity and a way to help further causes
she believes in (whether related to her work and prize or otherwise) and to
possibly even try to make a profit from it - by charging for personal
appearances, collecting donations from audience in a hat (see
my Stand-up philosophy idea at
https://plus.google.com/+ShlomiFish/posts/GUpTuA6641x ).

The whole &quot;they only care about my X/Y/Z/W - they don&#39;t care about the real me&quot;
is damaging. You are the whole of your qualities not just a core, minimalistic,
abstract, I-ness.

And you are a born superstar -

Best regards,

&gt;
&gt; The Fields Medal in Mathematics has been awarded to Maryam Mirzakhani, of
&gt; Stanford U.
&gt;
&gt; She is the first woman to be awarded this prize, the &quot;Nobel Prize of
&gt; Mathematics&quot;, and the first Iranian.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;The prizes are awarded every four years. Wednesday&#39;s prizes were presented
&gt; by South Korean President Park Geun-hye, the first woman to hold that
&gt; post.&quot;

&gt; Medals, which are awarded every 4 years.
