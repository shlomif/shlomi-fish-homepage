<p>
This is a local HTTP proxy to make
<a href="http://www.yjobs.co.il/">http://www.yjobs.co.il/, an Israeli job
board</a> work with Mozilla-based browsers (such as <a href="http://en.www.mozilla.com/en/firefox/">Firefox</a>). yjobs.co.il is by default
incompatible with such browsers. It may be able to work against other
alternative browsers such as Konqueror, Safari or Opera, but is not guaranteed
to do so.
</p>

<p>
It is written in <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> and uses
the [%- WRAPPER cpan_dist d = "HTTP-Proxy" -%]CPAN HTTP-Proxy module[%- END -%] which needs to be
installed prior to running the proxy. More
instructions for deploying it are provided in a comment at the beginning
of the file.

Happy job hunting!

<p>
The following projects helped in creating this script:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://www.greasespot.net/">Greasemonkey</a> - I initially thought
I could correct yjobs.co.il using Greasemonkey, but that turned to be a
dead-end, and the correct version of the fix is neither based on Greasemonkey
nor requires it.
</li>

<li>
[% cpan.self_dist( "d" => "HTTP-Proxy", ) %] - an
excellent CPAN module for building your own HTTP proxies in Perl.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> - helped in tracing some
Mozilla incompatibilities in the JavaScript code of yjobs.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/venkman/">The Venkman
JavaScript debugger</a> - also helped in debugging the yjobs code.
</li>
