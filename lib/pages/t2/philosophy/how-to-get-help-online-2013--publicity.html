The document <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/how-to-get-help-online/2013.html">How to Get Help Online (2013)</a>, aimed at
inexperienced and not too net-savvy people, aims to summarise and spread the
knowledge, of where and how to get help with oneâ€™s problems (especially
technical and software-related ones). While many Slashdot visitors will not
gain many new insights from it, it may be useful for them to recommend less
experienced people to read it. Furthermore, its
