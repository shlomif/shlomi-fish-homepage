This is an essay about a common fallacy pattern in the
software development world, which I call the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window">Broken Window Fallacy</a> of computers. As
you may know, in the broken window fallacy, one says that if something is
damaged then it generates more revenue to the economy, because one will have
to fix the damage. However, as is demonstrated in the article, it might as
well be a net loss of time and money. To exemplify:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Let's suppose a window of a shop of Mr. John Smith was broken by a stray ball.
Some economists claim that it will be a good thing for the economy because
it will provide money to the window-vendor.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
I talked with a few people on IRC about how I hated the fact that most people
are still using Microsoft Windows which is quickly getting infected with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware">malware</a>, or
<a href="[% base_path %]no-ie/">Internet Explorer</a>, which
is lagging behind Firefox and other browsers in its support for Web standards,
and makes the job of the web designer much harder. So they told me that it is
actually a good thing because that way someone has to fight the malware (a
very uphill battle), and they have more work as web developers.
</p>

<p>
In a podcast Interview with him,
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/AboutMe.html">Joel Spolsky</a> said
that <a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/foss-other-beasts/">Open Source Software</a> will reduce the demand for programmers, because they
make some tasks easier. And so programmers are happier, but they have to
work less. He missed the point that a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software_license">proprietary software</a> also does
that, because it costs a fraction of the cost it would take to develop all
its functionality from scratch. But that's not the main thing that is wrong
in this argument.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that tech workers can never run out of things to do. In the
time they have to adapt their web-sites for Microsoft Internet Explorer, they can better spend on
tasks like having better functionality, more web-sites, and more pages. The time
people spend making sure their Windows systems are free of malware, is better
spent happily using Linux and getting some actual, productive, work done.
</p>

<p>
So Windows and Internet Explorer are huge strains on society. I can never run out of
things to do. At the moment, I have an idea for a commercial site, several
essays I'm working on, tons of ideas for other essays, open source software
to write, and lots of third-party open-source projects that would love to have
me as a contributor. Trying to adapt my sites to broken proprietary software
only slows me down. It also slows you down if you're a developer.
</p>

<p>
Also note that I believe the happiness that programmers feel also counts. As <a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/41249.html">Aristotle said, the ultimate cause of human life is happiness</a>. Thus, what makes most benevolent people happy is moral, and what makes them unhappy is immoral. Moreover, people hate doing a lot of work to handle buggy and/or idiosyncratic systems.
</p>

<p>
A previous workplace for which I worked, developed a high-speed networking card. I was part of the team that maintained the drivers for Linux and FreeBSD, which were open-source. I had to do a lot of work getting our card to behave under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware_ESXi">VMware ESX</a>, which at that time used an old version of the Linux kernel (version 2.4.x) and there were many weird problems. This is while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xen">Xen</a> and XenEnterprise mostly worked out of the box. As a result, I passionately hated VMware ESX. I had enough to do without having to deal with it.
</p>

<p>
I don't intend to defame ESX here. It may be a fine system for hosting several virtual machines for the data centre. But writing kernel drivers for it was painful.
</p>

<p>
So don't fall for the "broken window" fallacy. Encourage everyone around
you to switch away from Microsoft Internet Explorer and Microsoft Windows.
