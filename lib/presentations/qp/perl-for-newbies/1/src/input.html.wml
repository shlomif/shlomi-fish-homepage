<p>
In order to receive a value from the user, perl supplies the <code>&lt;&gt;</code>
operator. When entered, this operator reads a line from the command line, and
returns it (along with the newline character).
</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/input/input1.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
Notice the <code>chomp</code> function which strips off the trailing
newline character from the variable. You would usually want to use it,
when getting input from the user.

Here's another example:

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/input/input2.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>
