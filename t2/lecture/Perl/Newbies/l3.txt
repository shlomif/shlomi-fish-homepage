References to functions
    Taking the reference of a function - \&mysub
    Calling a function from its reference - &{$ref}(...) or $ref->( ... )
    Dynamic References to functions - sub { ... }
    Behaviour of functions inside functions (lexical scoping)
        Demonstrate the dispatch function
Modules
    Specifying a namespace with the package directive
        The :: as a namespace separator
        Where to find a module
    importing modules - use My::Module;
    Accessing functions from a different module - My::Module::func().
    Exporting Variables
        use Exporter;
        @EXPORT
        @EXPORT_OK
    Importing variables - use vars qw(...); and $My::Module::var.
        Why "my" won't work.
    BEGIN and END - global constructor and destructor for the package.
Objects
    Intro: what are objects and how they are used
    Intro 2: how it works behind the scenes
        The object is a reference to a hash
        Its members are the hash elements
        The reference is "blessed" to be associated with a module
        That module contain the methods of the object's class
        When a method name is called with $obj->method() it is searched
            for starting at a module class.
        Note: in perl, passing the reference to the object is done
            explicitily and it is the first argument of a method.
    Object use: (demonstrate on Data::Dumper, CGI)
        Initializing a new object
        Accessing class members using $obj->{'member'}
        Calling methods of an object using $obj->method( @args)
    Making your own objects:
        The constructor:
#############
        sub new
        {
            my $class = shift;
            my $self = {};
            bless $self, $class;

            $self->initialize();

            return $self;
        }
############
            Explanation
                Since calling is CGI->new() then CGI is the first argument to
                    to function
                bless
                After the blessing is done one can call methods on it.
            Note: its name need not be "new"
        Methods:
##############
            sub add_elems
            {
                my $self = shift;

                foreach my $elem (@_)
                {
                    $self->{'sum'} += $elem;
                    $self->{'sum_squares'} += $elem**2;
                    $self->{'N'}++;
                }
            }
