CMake Talk Summary:
-------------------

Introudction:

    CMake - cross platform make.
    - configure the software build process and generate makefiles (or IDE
    project files) automatically on many systems.
    - Advantages over GNU Autotools.
        - Smaller archive files and downloads (no huge "configure",
        "configure.in"/"configure.ac", Makefile.am, Makefile.in, etc.)
        - Faster configurations (using the CMake command).
            - no excessive forking and running processes in CMake.
        - make/build runs faster (due to no "libtool" commands).
        - much easier to maintain and tends to break less than Autoconf's
        m4 macros generating /bin/sh code, with many other tools in between.

        - Better Microsoft Windows support:
            - can prepare Windows NSIS packages out-of-the-box.
        - Its licence is mod-BSDL instead of Autotools' GPL.

Core language:
    - A Specialised Domain-Specific Language (DSL) with an interpreter written
    in C++
    - Turing Complete (i.e. you can write complete programs with it).
    - Supports Lists.
        - separated by ";".
    - $VAR expands lists.
    - "$VAR" expands a string into a single variable.
        - Use it when it doubt.
    - Sometimes variables are accessed by name and sometimes by their value.
        - read the documentation to be sure.
    - identifiers are case-insensitive.

        - STRING

Building targets:
    - add_library
    - add_executable
    - add_custom_target
    - add_custom_command


Checks for features and libraries:
    - pkg_check_modules
        - uses pkg_config.
    - configuration options:
        - SET (MAX_NUM_FREECELLS 8 CACHE STRING "Maximal Number of Freecells")
            - BOOL, etc.
    - configure_files
    - CHECK_C_COMPILER_FLAG
    - WIN32 (variable)
    - UNIX (variable)
