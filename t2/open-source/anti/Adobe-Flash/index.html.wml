<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Adobe Flash</a> (formerly
known as “Macromedia Flash”) is a proprietary technology intended to be
used in web browsers (and to a lesser extent outside them) that some authors
of web sites prefer out of convenience and inertia, but many users (including
me) hate. This page collects links against it.
