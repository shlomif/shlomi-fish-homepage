<p>
As unlikely as it sounds, I think I reached the "right" conclusions at <a
href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/my-real-person-fan-fiction/">my
previous attempt</a> while having a somewhat misled deduction chain.
</p>

<p id="geek_def">
As of March 2021, it seems most talented,
skillful, competent, and attractive individuals of any gender, age
and profession, and past experience are increasingly both geeks (= <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/paul-graham.html">"amateurs"</a>; love what
they do; not doing it only for money, even though they may be offered
a lot) and <a href="#what_is_hacking">great hackers</a> (= "action heroes"; bending or challenging the "rules",
not accepting their fate, being resourceful, thinking outside the box, etc.).
or even "hacker monarchs" / "messiahs".
As I show, this implies most new quality screenplays and
stories are currently and are going to increasingly not only be fanfiction but
also crossovers, parodies, and/or real person fiction - usually including
recent [% proprietary %] franchises and recent (and often living)
real people. And they aren't being written in the finicky, hard to get right,
and boring <a href="#hollywood_screenplay_format">Hollywood-blessed screenplay format</a>,
and geeks will increasingly stop sending drafts or proposals to
<a href="#be_communicative">non-communicative</a> reviewers.
</p>

<p>
One thing I got wrong is thinking a geek will refuse to get paid. Perhaps it
was true for amateurs and geeks before the advent of Capitalism, but is no
longer true now. That is wrong, as of 2021, because often, geeks are now
offered large amounts of money or at least token
pay. For example, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>, who is
a software developer, an action hero, a geek, and <a
href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">a remarkable amateur
philosopher and entertainer</a>, is believed to get paid 20 million USD/year.
While he will gladly continue to comaintain the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux kernel project</a>
for less, it is commonly accepted that it is a reasonable salary to give him.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, attractive actors (including female actresses and/or inexperienced
and obscure ones and/or formerly big name ones) are also geeky hackers. As a
result, they will not play in any badly written film (and usually a dystopian,
ending badly, pessimistic, politically correct and dishonest one) even for all
the money in the world.
</p>

<p>
Geeks are not to be confused with "dorks" who are (for the context of this
essay) people without social life, or who seem reckless, not confident,
unattractive, etc. Moreover, "amateur" now has pejorative meaning of something
done poorly or non-skillfully but in the 19th century, it was a compliment.
</p>

<p>
The word "nerd" can mean either "geek" or "dork".
</p>

<p>
These were contrasted
to "professionalism" (= doing something only for money, regardless of how little or a lot:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJrqpR_7VSo">"We're not just doing it
for money!…We're doing it for a shitload of money"</a>;
not enjoying your work).
</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJrqpR_7VSo" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<p>
A geek may agree to do some tasks that are not too enjoyable as part of their
job. There is also the old <a
href="https://shlomifish.livejournal.com/1747.html">Stoic method</a> of trying
not to hate a task and even allowing oneself to enjoy it. This is reflected in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftxnr28LDXc">the "spoonful of sugar
makes the medicine go down" scene</a> from Disney's <i>Mary Poppins</i>.
However, if the job is destructive and pointless, e.g one that stands against
the contemporary <a href="#open_free_share_steal">"open / free / share"</a>
ideals, then it can never be enjoyable.

<p>
I also contrasted "conformism" (= playing by the rules of "society", what other
people expect you to do, following <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders">superior orders</a>, doing
what you feel you are obliged to do, etc.) to "hacking" (a.k.a "action

<p>
"Craziness" / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevi%27im">Nev'ua</a> (
which was mistranslated as "prophecy"). I suspect the hebrew verb
"lenabé" had sported different meanings in Biblical times, but
at a point meant to "act crazy", to "drive crazy", "to be crazy", "to seek
[divine] guidance", including in today's casual senses. It involved:
"funny"ness, exaggeration, song-and-poetry, emulation, contradicting one self,
<a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Luna_Eclipsed">intimidation and fear
(which can be fun in a way)</a> - even blasphemy.
Many [% MOTAS %] nevertheless found it sexy.
</p>

<p>
Plato considered insanity as divine, and during his time, the good “stand-up
philosophers” or nevi'im (and many similar phenomena in the Near East), were
often funny, or otherwise exciting, exalting, non "original" (borrowed and
built upon the works of their peers and predecessors), often seemingly
or actually contradicted
themselves, blasphemous or just seemingly "stupid", and didn't take themselves
seriously. Although held with <a
href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/image-macros/#pbride_philosophers">some
contempt</a>, they were highly coveted by [% MOTAS %].

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology)">Julian Jaynes</a>
hypothesised that the Nevi'im were <a

hallucinated voices of "gods" (= <a

and who spoke in poems or rhymes. However, now I think most of the later ones
were only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania">hypomanic</a> (=
mildly-manic) at worst, often spoke in prose or in free form verse, and often not
only emulated, built-upon, parodied, or mocked their predecessors or
contemporaries, but topped them.
</p>

<p>
And they were often accused of being <a
href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/image-macros/#standup_philosopher">"bullshit"
artists</a>, being blasphemous or stupid, and "contaminating the minds of the

Like Qoheleth noted around 300 B.C.:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes">“There
is nothing new under the sun.”</a>
</p>

<p>
Just for the record, while I am enamoured with many YouTube cover
artists, and whose songs comprise of most of the music I listen to,
my sister, who is 5 years my junior and who has a Ph.D. in Computer
Science (so she is intelligent and techsavvy), has a prejudice
against them.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The Biblical
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson">Samson</a> was <strong>not</strong>
in general
an action hero, but a classical "I'm
taking them all with me" / <a
href="https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0716.htm#28">“may my soul perish with
philistines”</a> tragic hero, who worked hard (and not smart!) and took
many lives of (often innocent) people who cared about him.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Naturally, when software developers say "I hacked a Python script" or
"The Linux kernel is a great hack" they mean that they were created or
concieved with pleasure. The Ancient Hebrew verb <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%93%D7%A2">ידע ("yada`", "lada`at")</a>
meant both "to know"
and to "have had sex with". However, I hypothesised that it also
meant "to create something with joy" and a linguist friend confirmed that. A female software developer who
paid me to teach her <a href="https://perl-begin.org/">the
Perl programming language</a> told me that writing a Perl script
felt like giving birth for her.
</p>

<p>
As a result, I think "yada`" had some of the contemporary meaning of "hacking"
despite some etymological erosion.
</p>

<p>
This corresponds with the <a
href="#hacking_and_amateur__vs__conformism_and_professional">"amateur" /
"geeky" nature</a> of workers loving/enjoying their work.
</p>

<p>
Also note that hacking sometimes <b>does</b>
involve a prolonged and intense amount of work
as opposed to the <a href="#david_and_goliath">David vs. Goliath
's "taking the easy way out"</a>. David for example
had likely spent many hours practicing his slingshot skills
and honing them.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
That put aside,
despite common belief, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-nasa-spen/">NASA
astronauts did use pencils in space at first</a>, just like their Soviet peers.
However, this solution was found to be lacking. As a result, space-friendly
pens were developed (within budget) and used (including by the USSR
cosmonauts).
</p>

<p>
Traditionally (as of 2021), there was an apparent
dichotomy between geek and hacker culture and "mainstream"
culture. Geeks were considered intelligent, but unattractive,
shy, anti-social, unathletic, and often without "real-life" social life.
My 2005 [% hhfg %] story
presented male and female open source and [% opencontent %] geeks and hackers
as competent, confident, sexually attractive, socially capable, assertive, as well as
popular and coveted. It was written as an antithesis to Paul Graham's <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html">"Why Nerds are Unpopular" essay</a>
and the <a
href="https://www.shlomifish.org/me/resumes/Shlomi-Fish-Resume-as-Writer-Entertainer.html">Buffyesque false
social dichotomy</a>. Some commentators claimed it was detrimental, because the
target demographic for "open source"/etc. geeks was the social outcasts,
"uncool" kids.
</p>

<p>
However, by the time the first season of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory">The Big Bang
Theory</a> aired during late 2007, it was an established observation that geeks
and hackers were the Alphas. Moreover, I believe that its primary "anti-Geek"
character, <a href="https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Penny">Penny</a>,
despite her "hot dumb blonde girl" image, and her ignorance and laymanship, was
a superb hacker and geek. This is because she constantly challenged and broke
the hidden rules of the show's more stigmatic (and less attractive looking)
geeks, and because she was passionate and enthusiastic about many of her
endeavours. Moreover, she is often depicted as trying to emulate the
nerdier/dorkier geeks, and successfully.

Hollywood's blessed screenplay format is boring, finicky, and requires a lot of

[% IF 0 %]
It only has one proprietary Windows-only program
and one unmaintained, slow, and non-responsive, open source program - <a

Moreover, it is poorly documented, cannot be <a href="https://github.com/caramelomartins/awesome-linters">validated and linted</a> by an automated program,

being XML and HTML-friendly</a>
</p>

<p>
As a hacker/action hero, I'd rather <a href="[% base_path

than waste time preparing one in its blessed format. Furthermore,
since it cannot be automatically <a

validated</a>, one often needs to revise or
amend the drafts, which is even more time-consuming. Rinse and repeat.
</p>

<p>
One can imagine most young
or young-at-heart screen writers who use code sharing sites
and services (e.g: [% GitHub %] or GitLab), wikis, desktop or online word
processors, or similar tools, will also sport the same sentiments.

<p>
So a lack of "original" screenplays and many unemployed screenplay readers is
not surprising.

<p>
Note that even if a screenwriter has prepared such Hollywood-blessed
screenplays in the past, he or she likely met enough fans, critics (either

a custom format. Perhaps any self-contained XHTML5/HTML5 page or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB">EPUB</a> can be accepted, including
ones on the public-facing web.
</p>

<p>
One can find many screenplays like that in
<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/"><b>Archive of our own</b></a>,
but there are likely many more.
</p>

<p>
Given many screenplays are reworked, or even improvised upon
during filming, their formatting should not be too draconian and
finicky, anyway.

<p>
I am quite happy with my
<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/XML-Grammar/Fiction/">XML-Grammar-Fiction</a>'s
custom "Screenplay-Text" format, as well as its "Screenplay-XML" XML grammar,
and I added more features to these grammars as I needed them
( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI - "You aren't going to need it"</a> ).
Nevertheless, I'd be happy with other grammars that can be validated and linted.
</p>

<p>
It is also conceivable to write converters from subsets of

part of our "Literature" studies and my classmates took turns reading the
lines. One day I was assigned to read the lines of the titular character, and
whereas most of my peers read their lines without excitement, I was
enthusiastically envigorating the role with much fake emotion. I became a hit
and almost monopolised that role.
</p>

<p>
One reason I did that was that at the time, I was more oriented toward
Maths and other exact sciences, and because in Israel, one's 7th/8th grade
Literature grades have little effect on their scholastic aptitude. So
I had little to lose.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I recall playing the close-to-the-finish monologue where I was
lamenting the disappearance of my character's treasure box. I felt I acted
unnaturally, but it was still fun, and my classmates gave me an enthusiastic
ovation.

<p>
My performances there are lost in the proverbial <a

in a manner which was both easier, more fun, and was loved by the geeky
audience (whether in the cinemas, or at home). In a way, she was one of the
few selling points of most of the series' films, which although skillfully
executed, were clearly not done by artists having fun. This apparently changed
with the 7th and 8th installments, which were reportedly edgy and fun to watch.

originally voiced by Eddie Murphy, and he ends up being transformed

</p>

<p>
These are all building blocks of my creative spiritual world. Any screenwriter
who can successfully mutate the screenplay (and they have my blessing and legal
permission to do so) must use recent enough characters and quotes. To quote <a
href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Groucho_Marx">Groucho Marx</a>: <q> I don’t

that he also was Hollywood's "alpha male" at the time.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I believe most hobbyist screenwriters either approve of other people
taking their works in their own direction ( <a
href="http://ccmixter.org/files/zep_hurme/38531">"If they don't like it, tell
them they can go and remake it"</a>. ), or lack the time and energy (even if

Good hackers are constructively lazy, and <a

As an analogy, most software developers will use high-level programming

Software calls</a> "throwaway code", or "in-house code" or even a lot of
shrinkwrap (open source/proprietary/etc.) codebases whose performances are not
too critical, as well as libraries, APIs, and development tools. Writing
everything in assembly (or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit">ASIC</a>
if you're really crazy and rich) will be a grand waste of time, and usually
development effort will exceed the runtime of code written using higher level

Similarly, most competent screenwriters will use characters, concepts, and
texts from more than one recent franchises or works for most largescale
screenplays. They will either get frustrated at their "lack of imagination" or
accept that the screenplay will have to be anonymised. I'm proud of me being a
fanfic writer / remixer, and suspect the situation will only get "worse"
for the commercial film and fiction industries.
</p>

<p>
Do note that, like parents, I believe geeky and hackery screenwriters are very
proud of their intellectual children (at least when they are happy or
hypomanic), and won't mutate them on their own volition without a good reason.
They will refuse to de-fanfic them, even if it means that they'll find
different jobs (where their hacker and geek nature is being approved of and
respected, including lower-paying ones), or become <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Con_Man_(web_series)">Con-Men</a> (=
creators who frequent conventions/conferences, and making an income out of it),
or like me publish and publicise their "fics" on the web and social media
outlets. I suspect the reason several promising T.V. shows (e.g:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)"><i>Firefly</i></a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator:_The_Sarah_Connor_Chronicles"><i>Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</i></a>,
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Shakers"><i>Game Shakers</i></a>)
got cancelled recently, is that their screenwriters turned "to the dark side"
so to speak and started using fanfiction elements there, which would be
a legal and pseudo-ethical minefield.
</p>

<p>
It seems the parodical 2001 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Another_Teen_Movie"><i>Not Another Teen Movie</i></a>
killed the whole genre. However, I've written the afforementioned
[% hhfg %] story in 2005 (after recovering from my
<a href="#learning_more_from_inet_forums">Technion "education", or
relative lack of it and entertainment</a>), and it is a geeky/hackery spin
on the teen story model. It too is partly crossover/RPF fanfic, but, despite
that, two teenagers living in the USA (where it takes place) asked me if it was
real.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, its two female protagonists seemed quite farfetchedly competent back
then, but I'd bet many younger girls (or older ones that have the right
attitude) today can easily blow them out of the water.

One reason the [% RIAA %] member companies embraced YouTube and other media sharing
sites as distribution channels for their songs, was that there were enough
independent musicians who provided (sometimes not too inferior and often
superior) covers of the songs and didn't care too much about getting direct ad
revenue. It's not as if one gets penalised for getting a million views (or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_most-viewed_YouTube_videos&amp;oldid=1004942122">many
more</a>) rather than a mere one hundred. Furthermore, to <a

Tim O'Reilly</a> <q>The greatest threat to authors and creative artists is not
piracy — it’s obscurity.</q>.
</p>

<p>
The [% RIAA %] member companies are happy now providing legal or financial
services to signed artists and lately even actively promoting them and YouTuber
singers (and the line between signed and independent artists has been getting
more blurry).
</p>

<p>
As an analogy, The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church">Roman Catholic church</a> used to burn at stake girls who
admitted to having premarital sex even once. On the other hand, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna">Madonna</a>, who identifies as a
Catholic, and boasted of having had premarital sex with dozens of willing men,
(and I have no reason to doubt her) was not only left unharmed, but was welcome
in some of the holiest churches in Israel and the Palestinian Authority during
her visit there. If you ask a Catholic clergyman if she or similar "sin"ful
women should be killed again he'd likely say: <q>Dear Lord no! 'Thou shall not
kill'. It's up to God to punish them if he sees fit, but we should not act as
his agents.</q>. So the Roman Catholic church now is more benevolent
- by choice.
</p>

<p>
More recently, the <a
href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ceiling-cat">"Ceiling cat is watching you
masturbate"</a> captioned image, has stopped many preachers from using the
shopworn "omniscient, omnipresent, deity [who cares about your sex life]"
argument. However, to be frank, it was neither effective, nor desirable. I
think there are far better insights and memes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">the Hebrew Bible</a>, than that
(despite being a non-observant <a

</p>

<p>
Similarly, the [% RIAA %] is not going back to the pre-YouTube / pre-"piracy"
days, because even if it could, it would rather not. We need to be more
creative and resourceful when reforming the
fiction/drama/Hollywood/film-industry world, but I think we should try, and we
likely can succeed.

<p>
The commercial fiction industry ( "Hollywood"/etc. ) is not a good oligopoly
because they assume people will only enjoy fanfic from one franchise or at most
two. This causes franchises to be territorialised even inside media
conglomerates. On the other hand, before the 19th-20th centuries, creators
mashed together the franchises of previous generations, along with [% RPF
%] and current trends and events.
</p>

<p>
These works were often found to be funny or entertaining evenby people who were
not familiar with their origins and sources of inspiration (often indirect or

Musketeers</i></a> despite not being an expert in French history.

<p>
In order to subvert copyright maximalism, actors or other film workers, can
finance the production of fanfiction screenplays starring them, and which are
not written in <a href="#hollywood_screenplay_format">the Hollywood-blessed

analogy, Nine Inch Nails' <a

very profitable.

For example, I think either Arnold Schwarzenegger or Emma Watson can afford to
license the franchises which I used in my <a

While I am playing the domineering "<b>The</b> Messiah" for now (because
frankly you guys suck!), there are likely others who reached the same
conclusions. And my secret plan for <a
href="[% base_path %]humour/Queen-Padme-Tales/">Queen Padmé
[Amidala] Tales</a> is to beget an even greater Hacker Monarch/Messiah, who
despite being fictional, is an awe-inspiring Renaissance Woman. But she too
will likely not be the final word about Messiah-hood just like <a
href="http://www.earthstar.co.uk/deep1.htm">Deep Thought</a> is only the
"second greatest computer in the Universe of Time and Space". Like <a

Socrates, Muhammad, Saladin, da Vinci, Newton, Richelieu, Dumas, Verne, The

the Naboo of the Selinaverse. And it seems likely that people had once taken
Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Saladin, Richelieu, or Dumas not as seriously as
some people later took The Muppets, The Beatles, Buffy, or the Web 2.0
Bloggers, or xkcd.

There recently were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joss_Whedon&amp;oldid=1014512799#Accusations_of_workplace_harassment">allegations of Joss Whedon ("Buffy"/etc.) misconduct against actors on his set</a>. He is

(including to a large extent the big name directors and producers such as Whedon

<p>
I was probably too young to have prevented the death of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith">Samantha Smith</a>, one of
the youngest known hacker monarchs up to her time. I believe she died because
in her later career as a child actress, she didn't insist on doing things her
way, until she was killed by a private nighttime flight plane crash, which she
took due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris">hubris</a> and
impatience.
</p>

<p>
I am however saddened that I didn't prevent the premature death of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie">Christina Grimmie</a> at
age 22 in 2016, who was a singer, songwriter, and YouTube indie artist. I and
others expected her to dominate the music world, or perhaps the whole world at
large, for years to come (and become a <a
href="[% base_path %]philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs">"hacker
monarch"/Messiah</a> so to speak). She was killed by an obsessed fan, who shot
her, and who committed suicide shortly after shooting her. I believe her death
was also caused by her not doing things her way, which made her later work
gradually deteriorate, her sex-appeal (which <a
href="[% base_path %]philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/meaning-of-able-competent.xhtml#sexiness-as-competence">correlates
with competence</a>) to decline, and she not remaining true to her YouTuber
roots (e.g: of she doing collaborations with other artists, including the more
obscure ones). She acted in one film before she died, but even <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH_6CQso2qQ">its trailer</a> was a
complete turnoff to me.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Therefore I decided that in my quests to advocate commercial fan-fiction, and
get my screenplays directed, I will do things my way. I shall remain living
with my parents in <a

href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramat_Aviv_Gimel">Ramat Aviv Gimel</a>, in
northern Tel Aviv, in <a

continue writing and mutating screenplays using <a
href="[% base_path %]open-source/projects/XML-Grammar/Fiction/">my
own home-grown format</a>, at least until I find or devise a better one, and
write a semi-automatic converter.
</p>

<p>
I plan to <a href="[% base_path %]meta/FAQ/release_something_perfect.xhtml">release early and often</a>, and not delete content from my sites that
some others disapprove of. (Though I may add notes that I take it back.)
</p>

<p>
I may have competition, but not only will I encourage them to try to
outcompete me, but I will even try to help them. I don't <a

unathletic and clumsy, loves playing Basketball (but "royally sucks at it"),
is completely non-violent toward the demons she slays, and even shows

( <a href="http://wilwheaton.net/">Wil Wheaton</a> ), a mysterious

They are not obstacles to be casually dismissed. But they may be
surmountable. Furthermore, I am not seeking to destroy the commercial
film industry this time, but to make them prosper. And I believe
commercial fanfiction will be nice to have, even if some film studios
go out of business (which I hope will not happen).

I created <a
href="[% base_path %]humour/image-macros/indiv-nodes/evolution_of_girls_w_weapons.xhtml">a
captioned image</a> back in August 2014 which echoed my sentiments that female
fighters in films have become not-as-intimidating-as-they-could-be. Taylor
Swift's delayed (and likely indirect) response, published in 18 May 2015 was
this videoclip for her song <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Blood_%28Taylor_Swift_song%29">Bad
Blood</a>:
</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QcIy9NiNbmo" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<p>
One should note that the female entertainers in the clip marketed themselves as
singers and/or models, despite the fact that they were technically acting in
the clip. If they were actresses, appearing in that clip would have
accelerated the coming of their “Hollywood unhirability”. But why should it have?

I consider myself a child of the 1990s despite being ~12-22 years old at the time
( I am 1977-born ). I recall watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King">the <i>Lion King</i> film</a> several times using our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHS">VHS</a> copy,
and while enjoying the opening scene was mostly indifferent to it. Now watching
it while being "hypomanic" and inspired, sends shivers down my spine from feeling
exalted.

Following my <a href="[% base_path %]humour/Terminator/Liberation/ongoing-text.html#dedications">lead in "Terminator: Liberation"</a>, I will
hereby praise both living and dead great men and women. This time
I'll
also add mythical / fictional heroic figures to the mix (which
many

I also wish to dedicate this essay to the cast and makers of [% BtVS %],
including <a href="#film_industry_losing_the_psychological_war">Joss Whedon</a>
and [% SMG %]. I consider Buffy to be the <a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs">hacker monarch</a>
of the brief "Web 1.0" period, comparable to Saladin, The Muppets, Jules Verne
and The Beatles.
Unfortunately, the growing prevalence of the Internet and the web (and
the <a href="#open_free_share_steal">"open" / remix</a> culture) combined
with some unfortunate mismanagement decisions (Buffy not ending at high school
graduation, <a href="https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Faith_Lehane">Faith</a>
being placed in a coma, and the show stopping being aired in Israel
and possibly other countries) started spelling doom on it.
While Gellar was <a href="[% base_path %]meta/FAQ/biggest_celeb_crush.xhtml">my biggest celebrity crush</a>,
a role model,
and the "queen of the (1.0) Web", she was dethroned by Natalie Portman
soon after that, who in turn gave way to Jennifer Lopez,
Beyoncé Knowles, and Paris Hilton.
</p>

<p>
Like I note, I suspect the creativity crisis of the film industry is caused
by its operational and legal policies, and film makers like Whedon are
not immune to their psychological effects.

<a href="[% base_path %]humour/by-others/hitchhiker-guide-to-star-trek-tng.html">"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Star Trek - The Next Generation"</a>
had already been written in 1990 and circulated by email, and I found it
even funnier than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">the original “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy”</a>.
The web 1.0 and especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content">the User-generated content trend</a>
only amplified the "problem", and I
had no qualms of writing <a href="[% base_path %]humour/TOneW-the-Fountainhead/">my Friends / Fountainhead crossover</a>

My
