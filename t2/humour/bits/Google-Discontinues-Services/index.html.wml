<b>1 April, 2014, Tel Aviv, Israel:</b>
Google announced today that following its popular decision to discontinue
not-so-popular services such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader">Google Reader</a>, it
is going to discontinue other services such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Search">Google Web Search</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail">Gmail</a>,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs">Google Docs</a>.
</p>

<p>
“These services have been suffering from declining use and popularity”, a
Google spokesman said, “as a result, Google decided to discontinue
them in order to remain profitable.”

<p>
After discontinuing these services, Google will focus on more profitable
ventures such as version 9 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_%28JavaScript_engine%29">V8</a>, its open-source JavaScript engine (= "v8 v9"), and its
mobile operating system, Mandi the Womanoid. It is also going to provide
its world-famous customer service as a service to other companies (“Google
Customer Service as a Service” or “GCSaaS” for short).
</p>

<p>
The same Google spokesman also noted that Google is considering to discontinue
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdSense">Google AdSense</a> and
AdWords, because they too are proving to undermine its profitability.
