<h2 id="gimp"><a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP - The GNU Image
Manipulation Program</a></h2>

<p>
I wrote the so-called gradient-fu patch, which adds Procedural Database (or
PDB) handlers to manipulate gradients. This patch was written and re-written
for several versions of the GIMP, and was finally integrated in the 2.1.x
branch (which has lead to GIMP 2.2.0), with some help by Michael Natterer.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, I added a rudimentary PDB entry to gimpressionist. Seeing its
code could use a lot of refactoring, I started a heavy refactoring of the
gimpressionist code, and am now its maintainer. This was followed by a small
amount of bug squashing and cleanups.
</p>

<h2 id="subversion"><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion - A Compelling Version
Control System</a></h2>

<p>
I started out by bug-squashing some bugs I found in the
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_issues.html">Issue Tracker</a>.
The largest contribution I did was adding a <code>--config-dir</code> directive
to the Subversion clients, to specify a different directory where the
configuration files reside. The original motive for this, was to fix the
test suite when ran using a configuration that breaks it.
</p>

<p>
After some break, I
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1846">worked
on the get_locations() patch</a> which enabled tracing the past locations
of nodes in the Subversion repository. (which is useful for performing some
operations). This patch took a lot of research, a lot work, and I received a
lot of help from different people. Eventually, a reworked version of the
Patch, was applied by Peter N. Lundblad.
</p>

<h2 id="perl5"><a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl 5 Core</a></h2>

<p>
I contributed some patches to
<a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.4/pod.html">the perl 5 core
documentation</a> to make it clearer and easier to understand. Later on, I
improved the default perl debugger (what gets invoked with
“perl -d myprog.pl”) by adding new features, adding new automated test code,
and by refactoring and clean ups.
</p>

<h2 id="kde"><a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> - a desktop environment
and a software platform</h2>

<p>
I've been an active reporter of bugs for KDE, and also have been
helping in triaging and reproducing some bugs, and contributed some fixes.
</p>

</p>

<h3 id="kpatience"><a href="https://kde.org/applications/games/org.kde.kpat">KPatience - A Patience/Solitaire Suite</a></h3>

<p>
In particular, I worked on KPatience's solvers, and also helped fixing some other bugs,
and reviewed patches.
</p>

<h2 id="mandriva"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandriva_Linux">Mandriva</a> →
<a href="http://www.mageia.org/">Mageia</a> - Linux distributions.</h2>

<p>
Mandriva is an open-source, desktop-oriented, distribution of the Linux
operating system (sometimes known as “GNU/Linux”). I have used Mandriva
since Mandrake (Mandriva’s previous name) 7.1 and have been enjoying it.
Mandriva was forked by the community into Mageia Linux, and I've switched
my local installations to use it.
</p>

<p>
For a few years now, I’ve been using first
Mandriva Cooker
and later on <a href="https://wiki.mageia.org/en/Cauldron">Mageia
Cauldron</a>, which are
their development distributions and have been reporting,
triaging, fixing bugs or providing workarounds for them
as I encounter them. I was the user
“shlomif@iglu.org.il” on
the Mandriva bugzilla. I know my way around building
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager">RPM</a>
packages for Mageia, and am an active Mageia contributor and helper.
</p>

<h2 id="syscalltrack"><a href="http://syscalltrack.sourceforge.net/">Syscalltrack - A Framework
for Tracking System Calls</a></h2>

<p>
I contributed many cleanups and refactorings to a Perl 5 script that generated
code out of system calls definitions. As an appreciation of my work, I and
all the other contributors got a T-shirt with the Syscalltrack logo.
</p>

<p>
Later on, I did some work on the project’s web-site.
</p>

<h2 id="www-form"><a href="http://web-cpan.shlomifish.org/modules/WWW-Form/">WWW::Form - a Perl Module
for Web Forms Management</a></h2>

<p>
I encountered WWW::Form because I looked for an easy way to handle Web forms
in Perl. After experimenting with it a bit I discovered that there were more
stuff there that I needed (and added it to my copy), so I contacted the author,
<a href="http://www.benschmaus.com/">Benjamin Schmaus</a> and he was quite
cooperative. Eventually, I also discovered some
<a href="http://www.securiteam.com/unixfocus/5IP0L2KBPM.html">Cross Site
Scripting bugs</a> there, which were also fixed. Other than that, the module
was extended, improved, and a rudimentary test suite was written for it.
</p>

<p>
Ben and I have since been chatting using Instant Messaging.
</p>

<h2 id="freecell-pro"><a href="http://www.rrhistorical.com/rrdata/Fcpro65/">Freecell
Pro</a></h2>

<p>
Freecell Pro is a feature-ful implementation of the solitaire card game
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freecell">Freecell</a> for Win32. Being
the author of
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell
Solver</a>, I wanted to integrate it into Freecell Pro. Thus, I reached
one of the Freecell Pro core developers and current maintainer,
<a href="[% base_path %]open-source/interviews/adrian-ettlinger.html">Adrian
Ettlinger</a>. Adrian was eager to incorporate my solver as well, and we
cooperated on incorporating it.
</p>

<p>
The two programs had some incompatibility problems, which had to be
resolved by Adrian and me. Eventually, however, the integration was performed
successfully. Adrian and I became friends, and we have been talking by
E-mail since then.

<h2 id="error.pm">[%- WRAPPER cpan_dist d = "Error" -%]The
Error.pm CPAN distribution[%- END -%]</h2>

<p>
After a long time of neglect by its contemporary maintainer, I adopted this
module, and fixed the pending bugs in it. After the originator (Graham Barr)
made me a CPAN maintainer, I uploaded several corrected versions to CPAN.
Further work and maintenance of this module was performed by
<a href="http://www.leonerd.org.uk/">Paul Evans</a> .

<h2 id="xml-rss">[%- WRAPPER cpan_dist d = "XML-RSS" -%]XML::RSS - a
CPAN Module for Processing RSS[%- END -%]</h2>

<p>
After running into an XML::RSS bug, I submitted a patch for it, which was
eventually integrated. I noticed the module had many open tickets, so I
submitted patches to fix bugs (while adding regression tests to make sure
they wouldn’t be re-introduced). When I started contributing, the module in
general suffered from poor code quality and a low test coverage. Together
with the maintainer, I have gradually remedied the issues from which the
module suffered.
</p>

<p>
In 4 January 2007, I received
<a href="http://news.perl-foundation.org/2007/01/grants_awards.html">a
grant from The Perl Foundation to continue working on XML::RSS</a>. In
accordance with the grant, I increased the test coverage of XML::RSS to 100%
and then heavily refactored and cleaned up the module’s code. As a result, the
code quality of the module has heavily increased and it was made safer and more
amenable for future changes.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2007/05/xmlrss_cleanup_grant_completed.html">The
final report of the grant</a> provides a summary and some links for what
has been accomplished before and during the grant.
</p>

<h2 id="qclam"><a href="http://sageshome.net/oss/qclam.php">QClam</a></h2>

<p>
QClam is a simple program to use ClamAV in dot-qmail files. I performed some
bug-fixing to it and made the code more secure, and converted the code from
C++ to C, so it will have less dependencies. My changes were incorporated into
version 0.6.
</p>

<h2 id="loggedfs"><a href="http://loggedfs.sourceforge.net/">LoggedFS - Filesystem Monitoring with Fuse</a></h2>

<p>
I fixed some incompatibilities that made loggedfs unusable to wrap
the KDE configuration directory, and ported it to the new version of FUSE. My
changes were incorporated into version 0.4 of LoggedFS.
</p>

<h2 id="file-find-object"><a href="[% base_path %]open-source/projects/File-Find-Object/">File-Find-Object</a></h2>

<p>
File-Find-Object is a CPAN module, originally created by
<a href="http://metacpan.org/author/NANARDON">Olivier Thauvin (Nanardon)</a>,
which allows one to traverse a directory tree, and solves some inherent
limitations in the perl 5 core File::Find module. I started contributing
to this module after its 0.0.2 release, and did most of the work on it
since, including a lot of refactoring, bug fixing, and feature addition.
</p>

<p>
More recently, I worked on File-Find-Object-Rule, which is
a port of File-Find-Rule to File-Find-Object. This in turn provides
a convenient, declarative interface to File-Find-Object, while overcoming the
philosophical limitations of File::Find.
