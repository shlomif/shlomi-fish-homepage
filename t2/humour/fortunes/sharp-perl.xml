          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: I found out that my project compiles really quickly.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: under 5 or 10 minutes on a P4-2.4GHz with 1 GB of RAM.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: maybe KDE is making g++ look bad.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">rindolf: yeah, i'm not a big KDE fan</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: actually I'm using KDE-3.5.8 here.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: I was talking about the compilation speed of KDE apps and KDE itself.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: possibly because each file has half-a-gazillion headers.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">My C++ code is a server one, so we don't have too many deps.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">yeah, isn't there a way to cache header files? ie. in their "compiled" form?</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">or is that something I'm remembering from some other programming language that purported to build on top of C?</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: MSVC has that.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">ahh, nods</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: no, Visual C++ has precompiled headers.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: I remember that I kept deleting them.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">yeah, couldn't remember</saying>

          <saying who="rindolf">Pascal compiles very quickly.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">That's one of the things I enjoyed in Delphi.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">ugh, the app i'm been maintaining in Java was originally a fat client/server desktop app, written in Delphi</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: ah.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">i remember booting up the old app for the first time, and being amazed at how slow it was</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">eventually, i had to duplicate a feature in the Java code and i wasn't sure how it was implemented before</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: you mean the Java app is faster? :S</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">so being as i had no Delphi experience, and the newer Delphi environments made NO sense to me at all, i just opened up the SQL Server query analyzer</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">rindolf: yes, but only b/c the Delphi programmer was an idiot, issuing queries over and over again needlessly</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">rindolf: if you could've seen the MSSQL Performance Analyzer or whatever, it was basically just.. Query1, Query2, Query3, Query1, Query2, Query3, repeat.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">it was probably the worst ive ever seen in my life.. belongs on www.thedailywtf.com </saying>

<saying who="ne2k__">yrlnry: not that it has anything to do with perl, but the &lt;input&gt; tag in HTML has both &quot;name&quot; and &quot;value&quot; attributes. the value is what gets shown in the browser typically.</saying>

<saying who="perlygatekeeper">rindolf was that someone pretending to be me?</saying>
<saying who="perlygatekeeper">I never said those things</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlygatekeeper: it&#39;s a fictitious story.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlygatekeeper: relax.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">perlygatekeeper: or you could be the imposter right now... or maybe just schizophrenic.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: MPDed not schizophrenic.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: schizophrenia is not Multi-Persona-Disordered.</saying>
<saying who="b0at">perlygatekeeper: It&#39;s fan fiction from your fan!</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">rindolf: what&#39;s the difference?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: MPD is when there are several personalities living inside your brain.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: in schizophrenia, you have one I-ness, but hear voices, hallucinate and stuff.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">rindolf: Ah. Why is it considered a disorder? MPD could be quite useful... One would have different perspectives on a subject.</saying>
<saying who="perlygatekeeper">where&#39;s beth, she&#39;ll know it&#39;s me</saying>
<saying who="integral">But how will we know it&#39;s beth?!</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">rindolf: Oh, I have MPD then, not schizophrenia. I don&#39;t hallucinate.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">integral: WE DON&#39;T!</saying>
<saying who="b0at">I don&#39;t hallucinate, but my other personality does.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">How do I know all of you exist? Am I just a figment of my own imagination?</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">b0at: Interesting...</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: Julian Jaynes describes schizophrenia very well in his &quot;The Origins of Consciousness during the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind book&quot;.</saying>

<saying who="dabreegster">Wait, I do have the Voices. Maybe I have MPD _and_ schizophrenia.</saying>
<saying who="b0at">Ah, but the question is: do the Voices have voices?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Consciousness_in_the_Breakdown_of_the_Bicameral_Mind</saying>
<saying who="b0at">And if so, is it your own voice?</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">b0at: And do the voices of the voices have voices?</saying>
<saying who="b0at">That&#39;s just going too far.</saying>
<saying who="dkr">don&#39;t worry, those are angels, invest in tarot cards and you will be able to understand them</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">b0at: and if it&#39;s not, then could it be the voice of........ integral? rindolf? or.... buu!</saying>
<saying who="b0at">buu has other plans for our empty skulls</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">b0at: and if they do, then what do the voices of the voices of the voices of the Voices sound like?</saying>
<saying who="integral">*sob* it&#39;s the cabbages.   The cabbages keep telling me to do things</saying>

<saying who="dabreegster">The lawn gnomes tell me to stay away from Life. They force me to write poetry.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">markl_: there are plenty of other web-devel frameworks.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlbot: web frameworks</saying>
<saying who="perlbot">rindolf: CGI-Application (and Titanium), CGI-Application-Plus, CGI-Builder, CGI-Prototype, Jifty, Catalyst (and Reaction), Mojo, SweetPea, Dancer, Gantry, AxKit, WebGUI</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">markl_: yeah.</saying>
<saying who="markl_">what are the easiest ones for people good with perl but not HTML/CSS/AJAX experts ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">markl_: not that Ruby or PHP have fewer.</saying>
<saying who="markl_">or the most widely adopted one ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">markl_: the most popular appears to be Catalyst.</saying>
<saying who="markl_">catalyst seems to at least have a book :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">markl_: it has several books.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">markl_: I worked a bit with Mojolicious, and it wasn&#39;t too bad, but it reinvents a lot of wheels.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Due to its philosophy.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">markl_: I also did some Catalyst projects.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">mst: I think that&#39;s the case, no need to preach to mutewit about it.</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">mutewit: I did, and figured out the soln. when switching windows.</saying>
<saying who="mst">mutewit: aye. I&#39;m just trying to explain how to get the most learning out of us as well as the most working code.</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">sometimes thinks we spend much more IRC volume discussing netiquette than actually suffering from the bad netiquette.</me_is>
<saying who="mutewit">But by the time I came back to the channel there was a whole page of &quot;preaching&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">I was using a split method with array indexing and it felt too much like a C-approach.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: oh, you split the string into chars?</saying>
<saying who="mst">yeah, by the time you&#39;ve done map, join, split, ...</saying>
<saying who="mst">you&#39;ve basically just reimplemented substr badly :)</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">rindolf: That&#39;s what I was doing, but the map/substr approach is a lot cleaner.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: yeah/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: split into chars sometimes has some uses.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: but this reminds me too much of SICP.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlbot: sicp</saying>
<saying who="perlbot">rindolf: http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/ - &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot; - A Classical Text on Programming</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: see - http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Too-Many-Ways/slides/slide13.html</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: this is how an SICP programmer will implement a simple text processing task.</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">SICP, love the book.</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">and all the OCaml work this year has given rise to a functional bent of mind</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">which is kinda screwing around with my perl code.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: yeah.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Too-Many-Ways/slides/slide12.html - this is the fastest Perl solution.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">At least in speed.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">It can be a little shorter with a regex lookahead, but it&#39;s less elegant and slower.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Lightning/Too-Many-Ways/slides/slide9.html - there you go.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: did you know how to program before reading SICP?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I think it&#39;s not a good introductory book.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">MIT are going to ditch it in favour of some Python/Robotics curriculum.</saying>
<saying who="mst">I think it&#39;s only a good introductory book if you know some math and have the brain to follow it</saying>
<saying who="mst">it teaches a lot of hard concepts very quickly</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">mst: from a &quot;I&#39;m from the humanities department&quot; point of view it&#39;s managable. it&#39;s not easy, but everyone can work with it.</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">eval: $_ = &quot;0123456789abcdefgh&quot;; [ /(?=(.{5}))/g ]</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: ah. Using what?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">tybalt89++ # Up for the challenge.</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">and yes, MIT ditched SICP in favor of a Python-based intro course.</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">rindolf: I was off in other windows :(</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">mutewit: ^^  for 5 char slices</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mutewit: don&#39;t use it if you want future generations to understand it.</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">slaps tybalt89 with mst&#39;s slipper for golfing mutewit&#39;s solution and telling him it&#39;s a good idea.</me_is>
<saying who="tybalt89">rindolf: that&#39;s not golfing, just common simple regex :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">tybalt89: sigh.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">tybalt89: simple.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">irregular regular expression.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Maybe use Regexp::Common</saying>
<saying who="mutewit">I added in tybalt89&#39;s code but commented it for future reference.</saying>
<saying who="mst">I&#39;d definitely use the substr approach for real code</saying>
<saying who="mst">tybalt89&#39;s code is cleverness to prove it can be done; I don&#39;t believe he was recommending it</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">mst: sigh, yes, I am recommending it.  It&#39;s the clearest solution.</saying>
<saying who="mst">tybalt89: I respectfully disagree.</saying>
<saying who="mst">I find the substr approach far more obvious</saying>
<saying who="Chazz">rindolf, ty. :)</saying>
<saying who="mst">but then, I mostly write applications perl rather than scripts, so I only engage in regexp cleverness when actively useful</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">tybalt89: look-aheads and look-behinds are dark corners of the Perl not-so-reg-regexes</saying>
<saying who="Yaakov">In the context of this particular problem, it&#39;s pretty straightforward, but, knowledge of the development/maintenance team(s) would push my choce one way or another.</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">mst: note it took rindolf three tries, and even then he got it wrong.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">tybalt89: well, I&#39;m not focused now.</saying>
<saying who="mst">tybalt89: map substr($str, $_, 5), 0 .. length($str)-5; ?</saying>
<saying who="mst">maybe -6</saying>
<me_is who="tybalt89">turns the lens, trying to focus rindolf </me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">mst: -5</saying>
<saying who="mst">but it&#39;s hardly difficult; rindolf&#39;s just having a day of silly mistakes</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Unit tests!</saying>
<saying who="mst">I&#39;d expect him to get it right first time when on form too :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Some clear code is hard to get right.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Doesn&#39;t make it less clear.</saying>
<saying who="mst">yeah</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Most people will not write a correct binary search at first try.</saying>
<saying who="tybalt89">&quot;maybe -6&quot; is proof of unclearness :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">But the correct binary search is easy to digest.</saying>
<saying who="mst">tybalt89: no, it&#39;s proof it&#39;s 8pm on a sunday and I&#39;m not particularly awake either</saying>
<saying who="mst">but your code just made me go &quot;hang on, WHAT?!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="mst">then I had to stop and dissect it</saying>
<saying who="mst">-then- I saw what you were doing</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mst++</saying>
<saying who="mst">also, the substr approach displays the semantics and the reasoning</saying>
<saying who="mst">whereas the regex approach displays, well, line noise, frankly</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mst: why don&#39;t we agree to disagree with tybalt89 ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mst: so how&#39;s the weather? ;-)</saying>

<saying who="designerjean">i know i&#39;m not supposed to be using XML::Simple</saying>
<saying who="designerjean">but it&#39;s only one statement in the program</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">designerjean: is it causing problems?</saying>
<saying who="mst">yes, and it&#39;s the one that makes the $config you can&#39;t work out how to use</saying>
<saying who="designerjean">maybe</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mst: :-)</saying>
<saying who="mst">your exact problem is &quot;unable to use the results of XML::Simple&quot;</saying>
<saying who="mst">because you&#39;re stupid and XML::Simple is shit</saying>
<saying who="mst">please switch to XML::Twig</saying>
<saying who="designerjean">ok thanks</saying>
<saying who="dhoss">people still use xml?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dhoss: it&#39;s a dirty job, but it pays.</saying>
<saying who="dhoss">i guess there&#39;s that</saying>
<saying who="designerjean">another case of stupid youth</saying>
<saying who="dhoss">designerjean: how old are you</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dhoss: well, I&#39;m using XML for some stuff willingly.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dhoss: JSON wouldn&#39;t have been usable.</saying>
<saying who="dhoss">rindolf: i guess that&#39;s a legit reason</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Because I use them for text and stuff like that.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And it&#39;s hard to do something like &lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;b&gt;dhoss&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; in JSON.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">I think its mainly amongst web programmers where JSON is appreciated the most.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: JSON has many valid uses.</saying>
<saying who="DuClare">XML has none</saying>
<saying who="LeoNerd">XML is for putting attribute markup within a stream of text.</saying>
<saying who="dhoss">rindolf: yea i can see that. json is more useful in a cross language barrier bit where markup isn&#39;t needed</saying>
<saying who="LeoNerd">(mostly because it came out of SGML)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">DuClare: not true.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">XML is very widely used. that&#39;s like saying &quot;I dont need to know Java, because the language sucks&quot; ..</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">rindolf: you&#39;re mixing semantics with style here anyways. that would be bad xml.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: I was giving an illustrative example.</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">rindolf: then give a proper one. that was exactly how NOT to XML.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: besides , I think that &lt;b&gt; has some valid, semantic meaning.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And it&#39;s also shorter than &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: ok.</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">rindolf: no. bold doesn&#39;t mean &quot;be bold and courageous here&quot;. it means &quot;print this shit in bold typeface&quot;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">&lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;name&gt;Su-Shee&lt;/name&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">XML is useful for wrapping and annotating text.</saying>
<saying who="Dorward">XML is only useful for wrapping and annotating text if you use a properly designed application of XML and everyone reading the document agrees on what the meaning is.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">XTML vs XDML could derive from XML. (text and data respectively). then of course you should be able to embed XDML in XTML.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">oh wait. Im thinkin aloud.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: I&#39;ve recently played with an XML-specific compression tool.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: it achieved better compression than xz -9 --extreme but OTOH mishandled some «&quot;» not inside attributes - converting them to &amp;quot;</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">rindolf: what requirements are you trying to meet by compressing xml?</saying>
<saying who="PerlJam">smaller XML docs :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: well, to reduce the size.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">well, doh. but why?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: like over the Net, etc.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: it&#39;s like gzip compression/decompression.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">rindolf: I yet fail to see the point. :(</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Only domain-specific.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">why?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And if you have a lot of it it occupies less on the hard disk.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">Ah. you have like SHITLOADS of XML ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">It could happen.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Java...</saying>
<saying who="PerlJam">anyone who deals with XML probably has that much  ;)</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">Well, disk is pretty cheap.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I don&#39;t have too much XML.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, maybe a lot of XHTML.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">I was just curious about rindolf&#39;s use case.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">I was afraid that he was storing some binary data in XML. :)</saying>
<saying who="mst">I think he was just experimenting with technology</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Yes, I probably have more disk wasted on .mp3&#39;s and .flv&#39;s. </saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: I have some interest in compression methods.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: back from high school.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">rindolf: :)</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">if you&#39;re the company who&#39;s transferring 120 years of documents of a car company into something flexible - THEN you have a shitload of XML.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">There have been some recent advancements.</saying>
<saying who="rokoteko">So just out of curiousity, that&#39;s fine with me. :) Im just nosy sometimes.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: I think the wikipedia XML dump is pretty large.</saying>
<saying who="mst">I find it&#39;s usually safe to assume that whatver rindolf&#39;s doing, there isn&#39;t a good reason for it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rokoteko: there was some stuff about processing it quickly using Perl, etc.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mst: :-)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mst++ # Nice burn.</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">popcorn anyone? ;)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">mst: but it has a huge grain of truth in it I admit.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: microwave popcorn?</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">I don&#39;t have a microwave and I was being sarcastic...</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">I need a smiley for that.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Su-Shee">rindolf-shaped, obviously.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Su-Shee: yes, I was playing along.</saying>
<saying who="petn-randall">why not an XML-conform &lt;/sarcasm&gt; ?</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">prepares some popcorn and shares it with Su-Shee using the Popcorn-over-IRC protocol.</me_is>
<saying who="DrForr">What&#39;s this about burnt popcorn?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Popcorn-over-IRC also preserves the butter taste.</saying>
<saying who="burnedcelery">you&#39;re getting my keyboard all greasy</saying>
<saying who="apeiron">ew, butter</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">And it also supports multicasting popcorn.</saying>
<saying who="PerlJam">butter++</saying>
<saying who="PerlJam">though not so much butter that it makest he popcorn soggy.  I hate that.</saying>

<saying who="rp21">hey, why did my nick change?</saying>
<saying who="rp2">yes it may be perfectionism</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rp2: ah, sucks.</saying>
<saying who="rp2">eg i want to get all columns from a database table in Perl</saying>
<saying who="rp2">now my problem is that i want to write code that works wuith a variety of databases and both on windows and linux</saying>
<saying who="rp2">it seems that as soon as i have found a way to overcome a particular restriction, i mentally add another and spend my time trying to overcome that too, sometimes losing track of the reason i started the script</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">rp2: heh.</saying>
<saying who="rp2">if i were a better programmer i&#39;d get through the hurdles quicker and end up with solvesworldhunger.pl</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">rp2: :-D</saying>
<saying who="rp2">except that it&#39;d never get finished because i&#39;d first fix the OSes it&#39;s supposed to run on,</saying>

                <p>
                    (This bit was posted anonymously to a pastebot on 23 March, 
                    2011. It is placed her for posterity after some editing.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Question: how can I switch off my TV?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What he wants to hear? For example: Locate on/off button 
                    your TV remote a press it. The button is usually red and 
                    located at the topmost line on the remote.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The #perl expert's answer: First, what do you mean with 
                    "switch off"? Define it first. Nopaste your TV, TV remote 
                    and the living room too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a nopaste:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your room is ugly. And the TV looks terrible. Use 
                    <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Clean">Mr. 
                        Clean</a> on the screen and clean your living room 
                    first. Use three cleaning mops instead of two. Use HDMI and 
                    never use scart (?) connectors, unless you really want to. 
                    Your TV remote has unreadable buttons, clean up first.
