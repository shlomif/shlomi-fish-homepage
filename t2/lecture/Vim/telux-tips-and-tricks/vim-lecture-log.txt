Now, let's start.

You see it? Right.

This - { and this } jump paragraphs.

Shall I go over my .vimrc?

Hello this is a long line and you don't want to keep it this way. Seriusly, are you crazy, it's very long. WTF?
Mapping
Too
World

gqip / yip / dip

The ip selects the entire paragraph inside anything inside it.

Hello this is a long line and you don't want to keep it this way. Seriusly, are
you crazy, it's very long. WTF?  Mapping Too World

    Now we've pressed gqip here^^^^



«:set shiftwidth=4» controls the ">>" and "<<" and ">" and "<", etc.
which shifts the document.

You enter the guillemens using Ctrl+K-<-< or ->->.

Hello
        Yes
World
    Done
Begin
	Hello
End


Are you familiar with tags?

These are tags ^^^.

You can jump to the definition of an identifier in a hypertext-like manner.

Ctrl+] jumps to the tag. Ctrl+t is back.

<a( - de-indents the (....) block.

OK.  I asked about BiDi editing in vim.
If it does not exist now, it should be hacked.
I thought about somehow invoking fribidi from vim and doing something to
cursor.

Well, in Vim, either the Latin is reversed or the Hebrew/Arabic/etc.
It can reverse the direction of the entire text. For writing Bidi texts, I
tend to use other editors: kedit, latest KDE's kate, or I was told Katoob is
also good.

Yuk.

Yes, kedit is pretty hideous. I saw that there are problems in Notepad++
in Windows too.

gedit Hello

I use gedit for this purpose and gedit is actually rather decent, and even can be extended with Python scripts.
But I prefer to hack emacs and now maybe vim.

Well, last time I checked gedit didn't have a logical cursor.

gedit rulz!!!1111111 VIM is 4 g33x!!!!!!1111

GEdit is the Fakatza's Editor!

sub baba(
	Hello
	Thger
)

Yes, we do.

Behdad and his friend said they were interested in a truly-BiDi
-enabled Vim.

Does anyone know a programmer of Apache internals (MPM, filters, buckets/
brigades, etc.) - please call Eli - 050-5237338 eli-at-netmask.it
THANKS!

thanks.

If I press 0 - it goes to the first column of the text.
If I press ^ - it goes to the first non-whitespace character of the line.

			Hello askjdla s jckandkcas

The \< is start word in /-searches. The \> is end-word
Like \b in Perl.

Hlelo

fortunately for the poor, they have food.

A (capital "A") appends to the end of the line.

I (capital "I") inserts at the start of the line.

	Torrents .asdasd A line.Hello

"c" changes (equivalent to d+i).

B, W, w , b - jumps words or WORDS.

Ctrl+R+w - insert the word under the cursor in the command line editing
mode.

Ctrl+R+% - the current filename.

Now we are going to the coffee shop.
