<p>
I've set up <a href="http://shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/division-two/">a
    mirror of the old "Division Two Magazine" site</a> that went offline
and was replaced by a parked domain. Lots of gems there:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    Today I'm going to tackle one of the hottest topics in the industry,
    comparing Microsoft's latest offerings to the offerings being released by
    the major Linux players for both network servers and desktop solutions. I
    am going to steer clear of "total cost of ownership" arguments, because
    Microsoft has already funded extensive research that has  
    <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/News/1137722">proven</a> Windows is
    cheaper to own and operate than Linux. I'm going to be looking at the issue
    from a pure usability perspective. Which platform saves me the most time?
    Which platform has the features I need? Which platform has the best third
    party applications and utilities?
    </p>

(See <a href="http://divisiontwo.shlomifish.org/articles/mcse2.htm">"Windows
    vs. Linux on the Server and the Desktop by Jorge Lopez, MCSE</a> for
more.)
</p>

<p>
I also added <a href="http://shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/top-12-things-likely-to-be-overheard-if-you-had-a-klingon-programmer.html">"Top 12 things likely to be overheard if you had a Klingon Programmer"</a> (which was also not
originated by me):
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    12) "Specifications are for the weak and timid!"
    </p>

    <p>
11) "This machine is a piece of GAGH! I need dual Pentium processors if I am to do battle with this code!"
</p>

<p>
10) "You cannot really appreciate Dilbert unless you've read it in the original Klingon." 
</p>

<p>
There are <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/shlomif-fav.html#mit-writers-j-hall-sentence-composition">two 
    new fortunes on the shlomif-fav collection</a>.
</p>

<p>
Added Waf to the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/software-tools/">"Software
    Construction and Management Tools" directory</a>. Added Bluefish
and Code::Blocks to
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/editors-and-IDEs/">the
    list of Editors and IDEs</a>.
</p>

<p>
New links in <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/apple/">anti-Apple page</a>, <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/no-ie/">and the "Stop Using
    Internet Explorer" page</a>.
<p>

<p>
Finally as part of the conversion of the <a href="http://thewml.org/">Website
    META Language</a>'s build system from GNU Autotools to 
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>, the web-site's build process
was cleaned up and updated to build more cleanly.
