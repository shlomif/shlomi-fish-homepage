There's a new 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/How-many-Wikipedia-Editors/">humorous bit "How many Wikipedia Editors does it Take to Change a 
    Lightbulb?</a> and as an experiment I've enabled the JavaScript-based
<a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus comments</a> on that page.

There's a new <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/open-source/foss-licences-wars/">essay called "FOSS Licences Wars" about Open Source Licences</a>:

<blockquote>
<p>
When <a class="ulink" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky
    ("Joel on Software")</a> wrote his notorious blog post
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01.html">"Language
    Wars"</a>, many people asked whether he has "jumped the
shark" and that his blog will go downhill from there. I too have read
the post, and agreed, that while it had a few good points, it was
too based on "feeling rather than knowing". Joel later on posted
many good articles and shorter entries on his blog, but many people
still recalled it as a very low-point in the blog.
</p>
<p>
Like Joel, I have a home-site and several blogs, where I post articles
and essays about my thoughts, and this time I've decided to risk
something similar to what Joel has done on an equally flamatory topic:
<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_licence">licences
    of open-source software</a>. I'm going to introduce the various
options, explain a little about their motivation and then
give some advice according to my own personal opinion.

<p>PHP error debug list:</p>

<p>1) did you use the correct argument order? if you're a good programmer, use
the *reverse* from what you think it is. see if it works. no? you're not a good
programmer, or you learned php's braindeadness and can go on to step 2).</p>

<p>
2) did you think about your code? if so, don't. php will do it for you so you can do mindbogglingly stupid stuff, such as not escape the data that goes into your sql queries.</p>
