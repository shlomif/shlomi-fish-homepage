<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/"><i>Summerschool
        at the NSA</i></a> subtitled “As the
sling shoots, grown-up men will sob” is a screenplay where the Hollywood
actresses Sarah Michelle Gellar (of Buffy fame) and Summer Glau (of xkcd
notability) conspire to kick the ass of the NSA (= the United States
government’s National Security Agency), while using special warfare
that is completely non-violent:

A brand new factoids page of
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Clarissa/">Clarissa
    Darling Facts</a> (from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarissa_Explains_It_All"><i>Clarissa
        Explains It All</i></a>) as well as new Buffy facts and Chuck Norris
facts in the <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/">factoids
collection</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>

<li>
<p>
Tomorrow never dies, unless Chuck Norris volunteers to take it out of its
misery.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The Chuck Norris of the Buffyverse, has been secretly training under Buffy’s
supervision, and so far - lost every battle with her.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Clarissa Darling can start from “I think therefore I am” and prove that the
grass is green, that there are about 365 days in a year, and that Isaac Newton
formulated the Law of Gravitation back in 1687.

I added a page about <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/">my
    nickname, “Rindolf”</a> and its etymlogy, as well as about
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/#rindolfism">Rindolfism,
which is my philosophy</a>.

<p>
There are some new quotes in the <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">UNIX-like fortune cookies’ collections</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I recall discussing Buffy with a Jewish American friend,
who used to be secular, and now has become an observant
Jew, and married a woman who properly converted to
Orthodox Judaism, and they have some children. We
discussed the fact
that Sarah Michelle Gellar was Jewish, and yet that many
men (and some Lesbian women) were more attracted to Alyson
Hannigan’s character, Willow Rosenberg, who was a shy and
sheepish, redhead, Jewess. Then when I mentioned that
Hannigan was only a maternal Jew, he said she is “kosher”
(because someone whose mother is Jewish and who did not
convert to a different religion, is a bona-fide Jew). I
found it amusing that you refer to women by the same word
as you do to food, but I think the ancient Hebrew word
"kasher" also means "approved", "appropriate", "legal",
etc.
</p>

<p>
In any case, both Hannigan and Gellar are now married,
and so trying to separate between them and their husbands
is not kosher. ;-)

Finally, the main navigation menu sports a new and more usable CSS style thanks
to the great work of <a href="http://joecrawford.com/">Joe Crawford</a>. Thanks,
