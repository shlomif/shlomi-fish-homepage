This is a guide to the prospective web-designer on what to redesign.

1. The homepage and all of its pages are in:

http://www.shlomifish.org/

Its proto-sources (using Latemp) are covered in:

http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/site-source/


2. At the moment the CSS is concentrated in:

http://www.shlomifish.org/style.css

There's also a print stylesheet at:

http://www.shlomifish.org/print.css

3. Elements of the site:

    I) The main body of text. (<div class="main" id="main">)

    II) The side bar intented for navigation and links.
        - <div class="navbar" id="navbar">

    III) The Breadcrumbs' Trail:
        - <div class="leading_path">

    IV) The top-banner/ads:
        - <div class="banner">

    V) On the front page there's the <div class="about_site"> text,
    while in most of the sections there's a section navigation menu:
    <div class="sub_menu">. There's a little JavaScript to hide and show
    it.

    VI) The recommendations:

        - http://www.shlomifish.org/recommendations/

    Contain a :hover effect on an entire entry. (Which does not work on MSIE
    6 or below, but I don't care too much). These will have to be redesigned
    too.

    VII) The sidebar contains many elements that should be made more
    consistent.

    VIII) The following pages:

        - http://www.shlomifish.org/personal.html
        - http://www.shlomifish.org/work/hire-me/

    contain a version in Hebrew and English as well as a simple navigation
    bar to convert between the two. It will have to be redesigned too.

    IX) This essay - http://xrl.us/v3do - was converted from DocBook/XML
    and contains some effects to outline the sectioning of the document. (like
    indentation or a frame).

    X) The essays http://xrl.us/v3do , http://xrl.us/knjz , http://xrl.us/v3dt
    contain a stylized note. At the moment, it has a bug of the frame and the
    colour going behind the "Essays" Sub-Menu.
