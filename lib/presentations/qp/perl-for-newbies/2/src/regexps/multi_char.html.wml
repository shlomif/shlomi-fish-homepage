In this slide we will learn how to specify any character or that a character
will be one of a range of several possible characters.
</p>

<h2>The "." stands for any character</h2>

<p>
By putting a <code>.</code> character inside a regular expression, it means
that it can match any character, excluding a newline. For example,
the following snippet matches 5 letter words that start with 'l' and end with
'x':

<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/regexps/l---x.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<h2>The [ ... ] specifies more than one option for a character</h2>

<p>
When square brackets appear, one can specify more than one character inside
them as option for matching. If the first character is <code>^</code> then they
will match everything that is <b>not</b> one of the characters.
</p>

<p>
One can specify a range of characters with the hyphen. For example the pattern
<code>[a-zA-Z0-9_]</code> matches every alpha-numeric character.
</p>

<p>
Here's an example that checks if a valid identifier for a perl variable is
present in the string:

<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/regexps/perl_var.pl" />
