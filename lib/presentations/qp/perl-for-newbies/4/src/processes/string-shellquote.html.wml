<p>
When invoking raw shell commands (instead of passing a list of command
line arguments) one can easily cause a situation where an interpolated
string given as argument will place arbitrary code in the shell. If
for example we have the following qx call:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
my $ls_output = qx/ls '$dir'/;
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
Then <tt>$dir</tt> may be set to "<tt>' ; rm -fr ~ ; '</tt>",
which will make the shell delete our entire home directory.
</p>

<p>
To overcome such problems, one should make use of 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/String-ShellQuote/">the 
String-ShellQuote module</a> which provides functions for safely
preventing shell-code injection.
