<p>
So why should we use accessors instead of doing a direct 
<tt>$person-&gt;{'age'}</tt> access to the object's property? There
are several reasons for that:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Writing the property names directly each time is prone to mis-spellings
and errors, because they are strings. On the other hand, with method calls,
the existence of a particular one is validated at run-time, and will
throw an exception if a method was misspelled into a name that is not present.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
If a property needs to be converted from a first-order property to a
calculated value, then one can still use the existing method-based interface
to access it, just by changing the implementation of the methods. On the
other, this is much more difficult to change with a direct-field access.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The external interface provided by methods is cleaner and easier to
maintain compatibility with, than a direct class access.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
There may be other reasons, like better concurrency, persistence, etc.
</p>
</li>

</ol>
