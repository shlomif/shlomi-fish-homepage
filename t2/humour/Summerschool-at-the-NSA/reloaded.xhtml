<h1>Summerschool at the NSA - ~1 Year Later - Reloaded</h1>
<p>
<b>Last Updated:</b> 9-April-2011.
</p>

<p>
The Summerschool at the NSA meme dates back to a correspondence between
my friend and I back in the haydays of 1997-1998 (with Web 1.0, before the
burst of the bubble) where I said that <q>Even the NSA doesn’t have enough
programmers. But it is not likely that they will have more, and that’s because
Summerschool at the NSA may might as well be the name of Sarah Michelle
Gellar’s next movie.</q> and he rplied that <q>And as opposed to I Know What
You Did Last Summer, it is going to be scary.</q>. It was based on a hunch
based on what I knew about the NSA from fellow Internet people and from
watching the highly recommended film
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers_%281992_film%29"><i>Sneakers</i></a>.
</p>

<p>
Many years later in 5 February 2013, I started formulating the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/NSA/">NSA facts</a> (
similar to Chuck Norris Facts) and somewhat later on 27 February 2013,
I <a href="http://www.advogato.org/article/1071.html">made a post</a> to
Advogato requesting Ms. Gellar to enter the NSA premises and document which
wonders or diswonders she found there.

Eventually, on 12 March 2013, I published
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/">a
    screenplay</a> featuring Ms. Gellar and her younger, and as far as I
know, unmarried and childfree, colleague, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Glau">Summer Glau</a> (to whom
I became introduced through the online web-comics
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xkcd">xkcd</a> (and whom seemed
suitable for that). The screenplay mixed and matched xkcd, the Jewish bible
and Jewish folklore, popular American culture, Buffy, Jay-Z’s now immortal
“99 Problems” line, substance abuse clichés, Saladin’s long-misplaced
approach to psychological warfare, My Little Pony, and more into
what is essentially a mostly-realistic, political story.

<p>
Soon after that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Snowden</a> leaks were
revealed on June 9 2013. While there may have not been a causation, there
probably is a strong correlation, because people realised that the NSA are
not-something-to-be-afraid-of, harmful, incompetent, and unuseful. While
the Snowden revelations are probably true, they
