<latemp_meta_desc "Solver for Golf Solitaire, Black Hole Solitaire, and All in a Row Solitaire" />

<p>
This is a solver, written in C, to solve
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_(patience)">Golf solitaire</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hole_%28solitaire%29">the
Solitaire variant called “Black Hole”</a>
and the one called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_in_a_Row_%28Solitaire%29">“All in
a Row”</a>. It provides a portable C library,
and a command line application that after being fed with a layout will emit
the cards to move.

<h3_section id="download-solving-data" title="Solving Data">

<p>
We’ve ran the solver on the first 1 million
<a href="http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/">PySolFC</a> Black Hole Solitaire
deals and one can
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/downloads/fc-solve/black_hole_solver.dump.xz"><b>download</b>
the data from that</a> as a compressed textual dump of an
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite database</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here’s a description of the tables of the database:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
<b>bhs_runs</b> - this table contains the results and statistics of running
the solver on the boards. Its columns are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>idx</b> - the index of the PySolFC deal.
</li>
<li>
<b>status</b> - a character representing the verdict - ‘U’ for unsolved,
‘S’ for solved.
</li>
<li>
<b>num_checked</b> - the number of iterations that were checked (“num_times”).
If the game was unsolved, then it will be equal to num_generated (see below).
</li>
<li>
<b>num_generated</b> - the number of states generated (and not necessarily
checked). May only be different if the deal was solved.
</li>
</ol>

</li>

<li>

<p>
<b>bhs_solutions</b> - this table contains the compacted solutions for the
solved boards. Its columns are:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<b>idx</b> - the index of the deal (that must be ‘S’ on “bhs_runs”).
</li>

<li>
<b>solution</b> - this is the compacted solution. The 0,2,4 etc. characters are
the indices of the stacks moved in the range 1-17. The 1,3,5 etc. characters are
the corresponding moved cards after calculating
<code>chr(1 + $suits_to_n{$s} * 13 + $ranks_to_n{$r})</code> where the suits
are ordered <code>H,C,D,S</code>. It will total 51*2 characters. Here’s
<a href="https://github.com/shlomif/black-hole-solitaire/blob/master/black-hole-solitaire/range-solving/populate-summary-database.pl">the script
that was used to generate them from the more verbose solution files</a>.
