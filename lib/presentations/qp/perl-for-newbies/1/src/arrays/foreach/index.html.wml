<p>
By using the <tt>foreach</tt> loop we can iterate over all the elements of
an array, and perform the same set of operations on each one of them. Here's
an example:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/arrays/foreach/foreach.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
The <tt>foreach</tt> loop in the example assigns each of the elements of the 
array which was  passed to it to <tt>$i</tt> in turn, and executes the same 
set of commands for each value.
