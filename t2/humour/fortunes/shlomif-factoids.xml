                      Chuck Norris wrote a complete Perl 6 implementation in a day,
                      but then destroyed all evidence with his bare hands, so
                      no-one will know his secrets.

                      Chuck Norris is his own boss. If you hire him, he'll 
                      tell your boss what to do.

                      Chuck Norris does not code; when he sits at a computer, 
                      it just does whatever he wants. (By: <b>Kattana</b>.)
