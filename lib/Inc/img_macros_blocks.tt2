Most philosophers at ancient times (and similar phenomena such as
the Israelite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevi%27im">nev'im</a>)
were essentially a form of entertainers. I suspect "le-nabé" meant
"to be crazy / to act crazy" including in today's casual sense.
These philosophers
were treated with the same contempt as we now treat actors, models or most
recently (as of 2014) — reality T.V. show contestants, or independent
(covers/parodies/remixes/etc.) artists on YouTube and other social media and
Web resources (e.g.: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber">YouTubers</a>).
</p>

<p>
Many philosophers were joking and didn't take their philosophies seriously.
They were often <a href="[% base_path
%]humour/fortunes/paul-graham.html">amateurs</a> (= artists or workers who enjoy
their work, regardless of how much or how little they were paid; a.k.a:
"geeks") and polymaths, who accepted different opinions, or people who built,
parodied, and expanded upon their work.
</p>

<p>
I suspect that despite what Jaynes describes in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology)">his book</a>,
most of the good nev'im and story tellers of ancient times were only <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania">hypomanic</a> (= mildly manic)
at worse, or possibly manic, who satirised fanatical or cynical zealots, often
spoke in prose, drama or freeform verse, and were in effect "stand-up
comedians".

I <a

when chatting online</a> that the reason Madonna has not been cast into an
acting role (as of March 2021) was likely not because she lost her acting skills.
This made me recall <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/howyoudoin/comments/m0bv5i/ross_in_s04e07_yeah_like_i_could_lose_it/">that scene from <i>Friends</i></a>.

This purposely alludes to sex, but is about something else.
In the Bible, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahab">Rahab</a>
is being visited by Canaanite soldiers who ask her if she hides
the Israelite spies, and they leave after she testifies that it isn't
the case. Even today, <a href="[% base_path %]humour/So-Who-The-Hell-Is-Qoheleth/ongoing-text.html#alpha-beta-gamma-omega">alpha females</a>
are held with enough admiration and respect to assume they know
what they are doing. That is because, among humans, sex appeal
<a href="[% base_path %]philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#meaning-of-able-competent">corresponds to competence</a>.
