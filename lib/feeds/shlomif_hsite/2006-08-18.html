<!-- TITLE=My Memoirs at Elpas-->
<p>
I have added a
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/prog-evolution/shlomif-at-elpas.html">page
    with my memoirs from working as a programmer for Elpas</a> to the
site. I’ve been intending to publish it for some time now after having worked
on it for a few days, and now it’s live. Enjoy!
