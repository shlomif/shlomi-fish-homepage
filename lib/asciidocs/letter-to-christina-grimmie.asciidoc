The letter
----------

Dear Christina,

**Executive Summary**: I have always loved you, I always will, I think you rock (and my candidate for being the awesomest individual ever); I need you, I wish you were here, and I strongly suspect you are still really alive, healthy, and kicking.

I may have been overzealous in my tweeting ( https://twitter.com/shlomif/with_replies )
and my "blogging" / web publishing ( https://www.shlomifish.org/art/recommendations/music/online-artists/fan-pages/christina-grimmie/ )
so I apologise for that.
