    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
        When <ulink url="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky 
            ("Joel on Software")</ulink> wrote his notorious blog post
        <ulink url="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01.html">"Language
            Wars"</ulink>, many people asked whether he has "jumped the
        shark" and that his blog will go downhill from there. I too have read
        the post, and agreed, that while it had a few good points, it was
        too based on "feeling rather than knowing". Joel later on posted
        many good articles and shorter entries on his blog, but many people
        still recallled it as a very low-point in the blog.
    </para>

    <para>
        Like Joel, I have a home-site and several blogs, where I post articles
        and essays about my thoughts, and this time I've decided to risk
        something similar to what Joel has done on an equally flamatory topic:
        <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_licence">licences
            of open-source software</ulink>. I'm going to introduce the various
        options, explain a little about their motivation and then
        give some advice according to my own personal opinion.
    </para>

    <para>
        I should note that I am not a lawyer, and only write this according
        to my best knowledge, understanding and experience.
        <footnote id="ianal" title="IANAL">
            <para>
                Some people believe that discussing legal matters should be
                reserved to people who are Law experts. However, this is
                a <ulink url="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=39148&amp;cid=62149">sub-case 
                    of the "only specialists should deal with a
                specialised field" fallacy</ulink>.
            </para>
            <para>
                Like it or not, the Law affects us all and the Government
                expects common citizens to be aware of it and not violate
                it, even if they are not lawyers. As software developers, we
                do not limit discussions on software and computing to people
                with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (much less a
                Ph.D. or whatever) and often not-too-qualified people can be
                very knowledgable and/or productive.
            </para>
            <para>
                Similarly, I expect discussions on the governmental law to
                have a lower barrier for entry than people who are qualified 
                lawyers, or Law Professors.
            </para>
        </footnote>
        I think what I'm writing here is correct, but would still appreciate
        any correction for future versions. If you're unsure about my advice,
        then you should consult a legal expert (if you
        can afford one) or your local or global Free and Open Source Software
        organisation. I cannot guarantee my advice is valid.
    </para>
    <section id="spoiler">
        <title>Spoiler</title>

        <para>
            In this spoiler I'll explain what I'm using right away, which is
            also what I recommend other people to use. When I started
            releasing my code as open-source software, I used <ulink 
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">the 
                Public Domain</ulink>. So, for example,
            <ulink url="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</ulink>
            which is one of my earliest projects and still one
            of the most successful, used to carry <ulink url="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/fc-solve/trunk/fc-solve/source/COPYING?rev=705&amp;view=log">a 
                <filename>COPYING</filename> file</ulink> with the 
                following contents:
        </para>
        <blockquote>
            <para>
                Relax, this is not GPL software, but rather it is distributed
                under the public domain. It means it can be linked against
                anything, converted to any different license, freely used and
                distributed, and anything else without any restrictions 
                whatsoever. No Strings Attached!â„¢
            </para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>
            (This was also a joke of sorts.)
        </para>

        <para>
            Later on, to avoid the problematic status of public domain code
            in many countries, and to avoid other potential legal problems,
            I started distributing my original code under <ulink 
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_license">the 
                MIT X11 Licence</ulink>, a BSD-style licence which is the 
            closest one to the Public Domain. If the project I'm
            contributing to has a different licence, then I disclaim any
            explicit or implicit ownership on the code I wrote, and allow
            the existing copyright holders to do with my code as they see
            fit.
        </para>

        <para>
            Note that I'm using different terms for other types of
            digital artworks. Most of my essays (including this one) are
            under the <ulink url="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative 
                Commons Attribution Licence</ulink>, my original (i.e: 
            non-derived-work or fan-art) fictitious stories are under 
            <ulink url="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">the 
                Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike Licence</ulink>
            (which is more GPL-like), and most of the
            photos I took and published were placed under the Public Domain.

                    for this.

                    benefits . Access to the source code is a precondition
                    for this. 
                </para>

        </listitem></orderedlist>

        <para>

            The <ulink
                url="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.php">Open
                Source definition</ulink> is similar, but some licences can
            qualify as open-source and not as free software. This is usually
            not an issue, because the majority of open source software out
            there is free as well. (And few people would like to create an
            open-source licence that's not endorsed by the Free Software
            foundation.)

        </para>

        <para>
            A software licence qualifies as a free software/open-source 
            licence, if it allows those four freedoms. There's still a lot of 
            room to manuever and to impose various restrictions, but otherwise
            these freedoms make them usable enough for the users and
            co-developers. 
        </para>
    </section>

    <section id="public-domain-licences">

        <title>Public Domain Licences</title>

        <para>
            The first type of licences are public-domain-like licences, also
            known as 
            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD-style 
                licenses</ulink>, <ulink 
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_free_software_licence">Permissive 
                free softwarte licences</ulink>, or
            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycenter">"Copycenter 
                licences"</ulink>. These licences allow you to do almost
            anything conceivable with the program and its source code, 
            including distributing then, selling them, using the resultant
            software for any purpose, incorporating into other software,
            or even converting copies to different licences, including
            that of <ulink 
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">non-free (so-called "proprietary") software</ulink>.
        </para>

        <para>
            Probably the only two actions none of these licences
            allow is removing the original copyright notice, or suing the 
            creator of the software for damages (the latter is due to the 
            "no warranty" clause). Some of them pose some additional that
            do not reduce from their public domain nature.
        </para>

        <para>
            Prominent examples of Public Domain licences include 
            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">the
                various BSD licences</ulink> (of which the most recommended are
            the 3-clause or 2-clause variants - not the original 4-clause 
            one), the

            that descended from software licensed under them, will remain
            under the same, weak copyleft, licence. However, one can

        The Artistic Licence was later clarified into the Clarified Artistic
        Licence which incorporated the minimum changes to make it "free" and
        GPL-compatible, and now has a new and improved version - Artistic 2.0,
        which is considered free and GPL-compatible by everybody, and is
        generally preferable for newer projects.
    </para>

    <para>
    Moreover, the Apache 2.0 Licence was specifically phrased to be 
    GPL-compatible, and is considered GPL compatible by the Apache Software 
    Foundation, but the FSF concluded it was not compatible with the GPLv2 
    (although it is with the GPLv3 that was published afterwards). Their legal 
    teams still disagree on that matter. So who are you going to believe?

The Creative Commons Attribution (CC-by) and Attribution-ShareAlike Licences

Debian legal team concluded that they were not free up to version 3.0, which
was.

    <para>
    I should note that I have issues with the entire Debian policy of 
including only free-as-in-speech material in their distribution, regardless 
of its type. I don't feel that non-software-content should abide by the same 
rules as software, and even <ulink url="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/09/191257">RMS said that computer games are morally allowed 
to have non-free graphics, sound, and plots as long as their engines are 
free</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
So Debian are trying to be holier than the pope here and try to coerce 
everybody into abiding by irrational rules.
</para>
<para>
    But this is besides the point of whether they are free or not.

    Another curious licence is the <ulink 
        url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License">Affero GPL</ulink> - 
- which aims to close the "Application Service Provider Loophole". What it 
means is that if I install an AGPLed program on a web-server and modify it 
then I must make my modifications public. However, <link linkend="what-is-a-free-software-licence">the Free Software 
Definition</link> , says that one must have "The 
freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to his needs.". As a 
result, I personally don't consider the AGPL as free (because I may wish to 
run it on my publically accessible web-server and modify it), but the FSF 
thinks otherwise. We have enough problems with the suitability of the GPL for 
embedded systems, that we don't need to kill the prospering web-apps market too.

    <title>Which Licence To Choose</title>
    <para>
        Now that we covered the controversy of whether some licences are
        open-source/free software or not, let's move on to which licence you
        should choose. I'll start with some bad ideas of what not to do.
    </para>
    <section id="which-licence-non-open-source">
        <title>Bad Idea No. 1: Choose a non-Open-Source Licence</title>
        <para>
            Well, I'm not sure it is a bad idea, but choosing a licence for a
            non-FOSS program is out of the scope for what I'm trying to write.
            I'm not going to stop you from trying, but I'm not going to help
            you with the licence choice, either. My best advice is to consult 
            a lawyer.

    <section id="which-licence-non-gpl-compatible">
        <title>Bad Idea No. 2: Choose a non-GPL-Compatible Licence</title>

        <para>
            David A. Wheeler <ulink 
                url="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html">wrote 
                about why it is important to pick a GPL-compatible licence
            for one's software project</ulink>.
        </para>

        <para> 
            Now, since version 2 of the GPL is incompatible with version
            3, and vice-versa (due to the additional restrictions imposed 
            by version 3) you shouldn't choose GPLv2-only or GPLv3-only or
            GPLv3-and-above, because some projects may be licensed only under
            one of them. Also, the version 3 of the LGPL is incompatible with 
            the GPLv2, so you shouldn't choose it either.  
            GPL-version-2-or-above or LGPL-version-2.1-or-above should be 
            OK in this respect.

        <title>Bad Idea No. 3: Choose a Custom Licence</title>

        <para>
            You shouldn't phrase your own licence and hope it will be
            considered open-source and GPL-compatible as there
            are plenty of 
            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FSF_approved_software_licences">open-source licences</ulink> to
            choose from. Creating your own license may put your users
            and you under risk of abuse and will contribute to the problem
            of <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_proliferation">Licence 
                proliferation</ulink>, and may confuse your users who will
            need to read your unusual licence in order to study it.

            So, don't do that.

        <para>
            I originally <ulink url="http://use.perl.org/~Shlomi+Fish/journal/36050">wrote 
                about the problem of saying your code is "licensed under the

            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAN">CPAN</ulink> modules

                on Perlbuzz</ulink>. I'm not going to repeat these arguments
            here, and just say that using the Artistic Licence Version 2.0 
            or later, or a GPL-compatible permissive licence such as the
            MIT/X11 Licence would be preferable.

        <para>
            It is not wise to licence one's code under the Public Domain
            because the Public Domain is not widely understood or
            accepted interntionally, and because licensing code under the
            Public Domain may not be possible.

        <para>
            The concept of "Public Domain" is not recognised in many
