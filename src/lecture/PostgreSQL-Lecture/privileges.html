<h1>Database Privileges</h1>
<h3>* PostgreSQL users can grant and revoke permissions to use or
modify their database data from other users.<br />
<br />
* The SQL commands GRANT and REVOKE are used for this
purpose.<br />
<br />
* For example:<br />
<br />
As user postgres:<br /></h3>
<pre>
test=&gt; REVOKE INSERT ON employees FROM shlomi \g
CHANGE
test=&gt; REVOKE DELETE ON employees FROM shlomi \g
CHANGE
test=&gt; REVOKE UPDATE ON employees FROM shlomi \g
CHANGE
</pre>
<h3><br />
Those commands made the table employees read-only for the user
shlomi.<br />
<br />
Now:</h3>
<pre>
test=&gt; GRANT INSERT ON employees TO shlomi \g
CHANGE
</pre>
<h3><br />
has given shlomi the permission to insert records into this table.
(but not modify its existing contents or delete records).</h3>
