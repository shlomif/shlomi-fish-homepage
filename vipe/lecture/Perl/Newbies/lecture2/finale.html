I'm reminded of the day my daughter came in, looked over my shoulder at
some Perl 4 code, and said, "What is that, swearing?"
</i>
</p>
<ul>
Larry Wall (the father of Perl) in &lt;199806181642.JAA10629@wall.org&gt;
</ul>

</ul>
</p>

<p>
But luckily perl 6 will support multiple syntax front-ends, so one will be
able to write Perl in an alternate syntax that does not have all those 
pesky dollars. The question is: why would anyone ever want to do that? 
<b>:-)</b>
</p>

<p>
No, seriously. We hoped you enjoyed the lecture series, but remember 
that it does not teach you everything that is to know about perl, 
much less how to understand other people's code. But it should get you
into a good start.
</p>

<p>
By now, you can probably understand the perl man pages, so it is recommended 
that you read them in case you are looking for more information. You can 
also post questions to 
<a href="http://linuxclub.il.eu.org/">the club's</a> 
mailing-list or to the 
<a href="http://israel.pm.org/">Israeli Perl Mongers mailing-list</a>.
And naturally there are many books and web-sites about perl.
</p>

<p>
We hope to continue this lecture with a mini-series covering Perl's modules,
objects and references to functions. Until then, stay cool and may the dollar
sign be with you!
