<h2 id="note">Note (3-July-2010)</h2>

<p>
I originally planned to prepare a parodical page about COBOL (more
parodying the pages of modern languages than COBOL per-ce) a few years
back, but due to some recent developments, it seems that I've missed that
boat. So here are my notes about COBOL, with a little organisation, just
in case it will make you chuckle.

NASA Uses COBOL.

<p>
And so do:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Your bank.</li>
<li>Your insurance company.</li>
<li>Your government.</li>
</ul>

<p>
COBOL runs your life.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
COBOL is the old Java.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
COBOL has its own modern web-framework:

<q>COBOL was an evolutionary dead-end.</q> [it
was so good it didn't have to evolve further.]

<p>
Of course Paul Graham was finally wrong about COBOL being an
evolutionary dead-end! COBOL now has a modern language
based on it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE">LOLCODE</a>!
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<pre>
HAI
CAN HAS STDIO?
VISIBLE "I WUZ ONE-S KOBBOL!"
KTHXBYE
</pre>

<hr />

<p>
COBOL has an Object-Oriented Programming extension called 
"ADD 1 TO COBOL GIVING COBOL".
</p>

<hr />

<p>
COBOL does not have all the computer sciency baggage that other languages have:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
COBOL does not support object-oriented programming.
</li>

<li>
COBOL does not support <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/01.html">closures</a>.
</li>

<li>
COBOL is not a dynamic language.
</li>

<li>
COBOL supports functional programming roughly as much as C++ supports
object-oriented programming.
</li>

<li>
COBOL does not support procedural recursion.
</li>

<li>
COBOL does not have a built-in support for regular expressions.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
You name it - COBOL doesn't have it. Get rid of all the cruft, and you only
have what you need to get the job done!
