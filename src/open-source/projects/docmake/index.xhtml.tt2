<p>
Docmake is a command line tool to translate
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook">DocBook/XML</a> code into
various resultant formats such as XHTML, RTF, PDF and XSL-FO, using the
more low-level tools. It aims to be a saner replacement, written in Perl,
for <a href="http://cyberelk.net/tim/software/xmlto/">xmlto</a>, which is
written in Unix shell and had a maintenance lull at the time.
