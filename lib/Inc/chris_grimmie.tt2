If Ayn Rand was born in the 1990s, she would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie">Christina Grimmie</a>.

Very much inspired by
<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Peter_Ustinov">Peter Ustinov's quote</a>:
“If Botticelli were alive today he’d be working for Vogue.” (which was
a praise of the then held-in-much-contempt “Vogue” magazine). However,
I am taking it a little further. I hope Ms. Grimmie is not offended by me
comparing her, who despite her early low-quality cover videos, is almost
entirely perfectly
normal and wonderful in any way, to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand">Ayn Rand</a> whose words,
deeds, and personal life, both exhibited many issues that seem appalling
in 2014, and were often quite objectionable even back then.
</p>

<p>
My point is that both Ayn Rand at the time and Christina Grimmie now, are at
the cutting-edge of influencing the world and taking it forward instead of
backward (despite whatever faults they both had or have). Back in Ayn Rand’s
time, books and the early Hollywood feature films were the primary vehicle for
influence. In
this day and age, however, songs and other videos on YouTube, especially by
“independent” cover artists, are what bring the most long-term (and usually
positive) influence among the people who matter the most (= the “Alphas”).
