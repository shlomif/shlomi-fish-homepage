<h1>Guide to the Electrical Engineering Faculty's Courses</h1>

<p>
Due to the incredibly kitchy, dysfunctional and non-standards compliant
<a href="http://www.ee.technion.ac.il">homepage</a> 
of the Electrical Engineering Department, the site became unusable with many
browsers, and many of the homepages of the courses disappeared from search
engines.
</p>

<p>
I decided to create something which is more usable and hopefully allow
search engines to retrack the homepages of the courses. The contents of 
this site will be gradually filled with more information.
