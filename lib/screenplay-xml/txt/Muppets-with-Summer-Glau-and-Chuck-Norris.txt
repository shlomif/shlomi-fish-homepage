[The Muppet Show Theatre backstage. Kermit and Fozzy are there.

ChuckN enters through the door.
]

Kermit: Oh hello, Mr. Norris. We’re so glad to have you here and we would
love to learn more about you.

ChuckN: Thank you, Kermit. You can learn more about me from my 500-page
autobiography, which took me an hour to write, and from the comprehensive
book of Factoids about me, of which I wrote every one.

Fozzy: Funny! Funny!

ChuckN: Indeed. Any way, I invited a friend who is even crazier than I am.

Kermit: Really, who is this crazy guy?

ChuckN: Actually, it’s a crazy girl.

[SGlau jumps from above to the upper row and then down to where Kermit
and Fozzy are standing. Applause.]

Kermit: Oh, nice to see you here, Ms. Glau.

SGlau: shut up, Mr. Frog! I’m here on a mission from the Grammar God. Herr
Norris and I are loyal servants of Grammar Nazism, which aims to unite Grammar
Europe under the reign of the Third Grammar Reich. Hail Grammar!

ChuckN: Hail Grammar [together with SGlau].

[A modern tech office whose door says: “Venting is Us.” with a large version
of <a href="http://xkcd.com/406/">xkcd: “Venting”</a>. ChuckN and SGlau are
sitting inside.]

ChuckN: OK, Summer, I finished writing another rebuttal, who should I sign it
now?

SGlau: How about
<a href="http://gilmoregirls.wikia.com/wiki/Rory_Gilmore">Rory Gilmore?</a>

ChuckN: Sounds good. You can sign yours as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Love_Hewitt">Jennifer Love Hewitt</a>.

SGlau: Cool.

[A few muppets who look like Mafios storm in.]

Head Mafio: Are you Summer Glau and Chuck Norris?

SGlau and ChuckN: [Startled] Yes, we are?

Head Mafio: Well, I am seeking vengence on a comment the two of you wrote
and signed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Alvord">Tiffany
Alvord</a>, so we are going to wack up this office.

SGlau: Using <a href="http://xkcd.com/322/">Electro-magnetic
Pulse Cannons</a>

Head Mafio: No, using these machine guns! [Mafio muppets showing their machine
guns.]

[<b>TODO:</b> Add:

1. "Stop Summer-time!" by M.C. Summer (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otCpCn0l4Wo">M.C. Hammer’s “Stop! Hammer Time”</a> parody).

2. Don't be venting - be perfecting.

3. Mafios offering protection at half the price - 500,000 virtual love points.

4. SGlau offering a milliard real love points (and meeting for lunch).

5. SGlau shooting a warning shot at “Fräulein Piggy” for a wrong phrasing.

6. “Carpe diem” song at the end -
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10PBekTNXoo">Caitlin
Hart’s “7 minutes”</a>.
