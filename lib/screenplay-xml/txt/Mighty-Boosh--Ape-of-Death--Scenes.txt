Ape of Death: Shut up! Now you shall burn! You and your wife with the
ridiculous hair.

Vince Noir: Ridiculous hair? Have you seen yours? It’s like
split-ends-central!

Ape of Death: Shut up!

Vince Noir: Well look at it - it’s an Urban Fuzz.

Ape of Death: Shut your gub!

Vince Noir: You look ridiculous - it's like a ginger ball bag.

Ape of Death: Shut up I say! [Rises up.]

+++: I’ve always had problems with my hair. Even as a child. It’s not curly,
it’s not straight. It’s somewhere in between. If I wash it, it becomes too
dry, if I lead [?] it, it become too greasy.

+++: I can't do a thing with it.

Vince Noir: Listen, there are hair products - straightners, finishing gel.

Ape of Death: Finishing gel? What is finishing gel?

Vince Noir: Where have you been. I could sort your hair out in six minutes.
