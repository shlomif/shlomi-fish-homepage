This story aims to tell the tale of a rather insane week in the life of an
American female graphic artist named Rachel Southern. A typical Hollywood
story with not-so-typical elements. Currently, only a Hebrew version is 
available. If you would like to read the HTML version on-line use IE5
for Windows, or Konquerer for UNIX/Linux or Mozilla. Let me know if it 
doesn't there.
