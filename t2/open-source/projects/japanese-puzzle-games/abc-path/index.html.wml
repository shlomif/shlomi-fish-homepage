<p>
<get-var modname /> is a Perl 5 CPAN distribution which implements a solver
for
<a href="http://www.brainbashers.com/abcpath.asp">ABC Path</a> as featured on
brainbashers.com. It provides a standalone command-line “abc-path-solver”
program and an Application Programmer Interface (API).
</p>

<p>
The
<get-var gen_modname /> Perl 5 CPAN
distribution implements a generator for ABC Path layouts based on a random
number seed. What it does is first generate a random path through the 5*5
board, and then assigns the hints randomly. Sometimes the process takes a
relatively long time to complete.
</p>

<p>
The GitHub repository also contains a port of the code of the solver
and generator to JavaScript, which will hopefully allow it to be usable as
an in-browser game in the future.
</p>

<p>
Currently, documentation is a little lacking.
