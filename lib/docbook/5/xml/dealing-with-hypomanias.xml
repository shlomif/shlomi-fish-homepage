                I’ll discuss some of my experience as a person who had
                been through clinical depressions, clinical anxieties,
                hypomanias (= “below-manias”) and even a few manias,
                (and as a result probably has Mania-Depressia or
                “Bipolar disorder”) and how I deal with the various periods of
                “hypomania”, which I still have occasionally: periods of
                strong excitement and feelings of self-grandiosity.

    <para>
        Have you ever entered a mood where you thought you were a bad person,
        that all your past achievements did not count and were bad? Did you
        find it difficult to perform many tasks that you could do normally,
        found it hard to concentrate, was flooded with bad thoughts, and had
        problems going to sleep? If so, you may have been
        <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder">clinically
            depressed</link>, or clinically anxious. In addition, people who
        suffer from <link
            xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">Mania-Depressia
        also known as “Bipolar disorder”</link>
        (like me) also tend to get into opposite states called
        <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania">hypomanias</link>
        or Manias. While “hypomania” contains the word “mania”, they
        are actually below-mania, and the person is still in control to some
        extent, and, with some awareness, may realise they are in a bad mental
        condition.
    </para>

    <para>
        Clinical depressions are not everyday “I am depressed.”
        or “being down” depressions, but rather a feeling that one is bad, and
        being consumed with guilt, with a tendency of being less communicative
        and less able to perform one’s responsibilities.
    </para>

    <para>
        I probably have <link
            xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">Mania-Depressia</link>
        (or “Bipolar disorder”) because I had a
        single “Great Mania” and a few shorter manias, because I have frequent
        Hypomanias, and because I had some periods of clinical depressions
        and clinical anxieties. So I’m writing about this from
        experience.
    </para>

    <para>
        One should note that one swallow does not make a spring. Some people
        had a few clinical depressions at certain points, and have since
        led happy, normal lives. An example for this are
        <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_depression">Postpartum
            depressions</link> which happen to some women after giving birth
        to a child, but there are other cases.

                One of my best friends has admitted that she used to have many
                depressions. Whenever I met her in real life, or talked with
                her (on the phone, on instant messaging, etc) she seemed very
                cheerful, fun loving, intelligent, and rational.
            </para>

            <para>
                She claimed that when she is depressed she tends not to
                communicate a lot and also cannot achieve too much at work,
                which she said only makes her feel worse. I can relate to both
                of these, as I recall that that was the case for me on both
                accounts when I was depressed.

                was a troll, but I ended up PMing him and it turned out he was
                depressed. I spent the afternoon trying to help him.
                Eventually, during his (and mine) evening, he claimed that
                he was feeling better and parted. (It is known that often

                very hyperactive to me, so I wasn’t really surprised, but it
                may also be plain excitement and not a medical condition.

            <title>Dealing with Clinical Depressions</title>
        </info>

    <para>
There is a lot of misinformation and dis-information about depressions in
the public. When I was depressed and hypomanic as a teenager I didn’t know
how to call these “conditions”, or how to effectively deal with them. If,
after reading the description on the Wikipedia, you feel that you have been
depressed in the past, read on.
</para>

<para>
The best advice I can give on dealing with clinical depressions (and possibly
also as a preventative measure or just to understand what people think) is
to buy <link xlink:href="http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Therapy-Revised-Updated/dp/0380810336">the
    excellent book <emphasis>Feeling Good</emphasis></link>.
</para>

<para>
It is a self-help guide for <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">cognitive-behavioural therapy</link>, that was
originally written in English and was recommended to me by my therapist.
Just reading it helped me understand the source of my hypomanias, and I found
the exercises recommended there to be helpful as well.
</para>

<para>
One important omission from an earlier draft of this essay was that I did not
summarise the <emphasis>Feeling Good </emphasis>book here, while I should have tried to in order
to give a taste of the book here (because I know I always hate “go read X at
some place because I don’t have the nerve to explain it to you.”). So I am going
to summarise <emphasis>Feeling Good</emphasis> here.
</para>

<para>
Note that if you are depressed, (and if you’re feeling suicidal even more so),
you need to consult a cognitive-behavioural therapist for a session, as
soon as possible. I am not a mental health professional and am not qualified
to give professional therapy, and this essay is not a substitute for it.

<para>
Burns starts by giving a way to diagnose your mood and determine if you are
depressed or not. I didn’t focus on it because I normally can eventually tell
when I’m hypomanic (or could when I was depressed). He then goes on to explain
that your feelings are affected by the thoughts that go through your head,
and that by challenging your irrational thoughts, you can improve your
mood.
</para>

<para>
He then lists 10 cognitive errors that people make which may make people
depressed. Among these errors are:
</para>

<orderedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
<emphasis role="bold">Should statements</emphasis> - you try to motivate
yourself by saying things like “I should be more careful”, or
“I should not have talked to him like that.” or
“I ought to be more considerate”. What these
should statements do is actually demotivate, and make you feel down.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
<emphasis role="bold">Disqualifying the positive</emphasis> - an example for
this is that when you receive a compliment, you say something like
“they didn’t mean it.”, or “it doesn’t count.”, or “he doesn’t know the real me.”
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
<emphasis role="bold">Mental filter</emphasis> - here you focus on one negative
detail (a “fly in the ointment”), while ignoring the rest of the picture.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
<emphasis role="bold">All or nothing thinking</emphasis> - you want everything
to be perfect. For example, you’ll accept no grade below 90% or so (even if
it’s a passing grade), or so.
</para>
</listitem>

</orderedlist>

<para>
Dr. Burns then gives a simple recipe to gain self-esteem: one writes down an
automatic thought that disturbs him (or her), and then the feelings that
he feels (with percentages). Afterwards, he should write which cognitive
errors he has made followed by a rational response to the feelings, and after
that the new feelings.
</para>

<para>
Burns then discusses several useful techniques for anger management, and for
dealing with criticism.
</para>

<orderedlist>

    <listitem>
        <para>
            <emphasis role="bold">Approval Addiction.</emphasis> - you
            want to be approved by other people and fear disapproval for
            them.

<listitem>
    <para>
<emphasis role="bold">Productivity Addiction</emphasis> - you care about your
work, how productive you are, how much you achieve, etc. (Much more common
among men.)
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
    <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Love addiction</emphasis> - you want to be loved
        a lot. More common among women.

        in everything you do.

<para>
    The book <emphasis>Feeling Good</emphasis> focuses on depressions and not on hypomanias.
    As the psychologist I’ve been seeing noted, a hypomanic person should
    perform cognitive exercises on his grandiose thoughts that are
    running in his or her head when they are hypomanic.

            When people say that someone is “crazy”, “insane”,

            behaving irrationally, not that they are mentally unsound. I know
            and have heard about many people who are eccentric or very

            lives.

        <para>
            Some bad moods are normal and are a healthy part of living and
            would not lead to depression. For example, if someone you cared
            about died, it’s perfectly OK to feel sad. Rational fear is also
            normal and healthy. My point is that one cannot or should not be
            fully happy all the time. Sometimes it is also OK to be a little
            “down”.

            Depressions have a cause. According to

                Good</emphasis></link>, it is
            usually a thought or a group of thoughts that is bothering someone,
            and caused someone to feel depressed. These thoughts are normally
            triggered by something difficult or intimidating, but it is not
            necessary that something like that will make one depressed - one
            can often cope with it without being depressed.

            In any case, Psychoactive medication attempts to deal with the
            symptom that is a chemical problem in the functioning of the
            brain. However, it does not deal with the actual cause that is
            the mental problem.
        </para>

        <para>
            In order to deal with the cause instead of the symptom, you still
            need Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy and to read

        <para>
            Some unipolar individuals I talked with, who seemed to have been
            somewhat
            <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativism">relativists</link>
            argued that being clinically depressed or hypomanic, was perfectly
            OK and that it was just a natural state, and that it was just
            “society” or the “environment” that didn’t like it. All of this
            is non-sense, because I clearly recall feeling miserable when
            being depressed or clinically anxious and after gaining some
            awareness, was able to tell that my hypomanias were not desirable
            either. It’s not a belief that people have conditioned me to
            believe - it’s one that I developed myself.
        </para>

        <para>
            I can rant much more about Post-modernist relativism, that
            some of proponents of it claimed people with disabilities such as
            deafness or blindness, who can be treated to some extent,
            should not be, because deafness or blindness were just different
            ways of perception, and not actual disabilities. But the point
            is that while you may experience depression or hypomania, it is
            neither desirable nor inevitable, and that you can overcome it.
        </para>

        <para>
            During my normal state, I had, like other people, experienced many
            positive and negative emotions: joy, anger, frustration, fear,
            boredom, a feeling of disorientation, love, exhilaration,
            attraction, disappointment, hatred, remorse, sadness, etc. This is
            perfectly normal and these emotions have a purpose, and I was
            otherwise happy when I experienced them. But they are more natural
            than depression, which is much longer, and is mentally and
            physically unhealthy. <footnote

                    One should note that emotions and feelings should not be
                    our master. Often they can be misleading and irrational.
                    For example, if my friend failed a test that I did well
                    on, I may feel smugness or superiority, but this feeling
                    is probably not rational or will make me happy in the
                    long run.

                    in the sense that we deny that we feel this way. But we
                    sometimes can acknowledge that we feel like it, and behave
                    in a different way. A person is allowed to
                    <emphasis role="bold">feel anything</emphasis>
                    including a desire for mayhem and murder. Only behaving

                    bad.

                    While we can enjoy a rational happy emotion, and
                    try to behave on a rational bad emotion, we sometimes
                    need to take actions that will make us feel bad.
                    For example, validly criticising a friend in private,
                    or admitting you’ve done something wrong.

            That put aside, you shouldn’t feel bad about being depressed when

    <para>
Computer Developers are probably more likely to become anxious than people
of most other professions. With the irrational working hours (see
<link xlink:href="http://www.igda.org/articles/erobinson_crunch.php">Evan Robinson’s
“Crunch Mode” article</link> ), tight schedules,
tactless or unfriendly co-workers, bad software management practises,
bad code and lack of craftsmanship, irrational management that
demands the impossible, too few vacations, and other factors - it is
probable that they will feel trapped, resentful, unhappy, and as a likely
result, anxious or depressed.
    </para>

    <para>
        As a software manager, it is your job to keep your software
        developers happy.  This means doing the exact opposite of the
        above-mentioned points. Refer to <link xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/software-management/perfect-workplace/">an essay
            which I started writing titled “The Perfect IT Workplace”</link>
        for more information on how to do that.
    </para>

    <para>
        As opposed to common belief, treating your software developers with
        superb conditions, will make them much more productive, not less. So
        make sure you read my article above (and the links pointed to from it),
        and integrate its recommendations into your workplace.
    </para>

    <para>
        Naturally, this is more difficult to do if you’re a regular programmer
        who isn’t in management. However, you can still refer your boss to
        what I wrote if you feel he’s reasonable enough. If not, it may be a
        good idea to quit or even to relocate to somewhere with more job
        opportunities. Some jobs are worse than being unemployed.
    </para>

    <para>
        Obviously, from reading <emphasis>Feeling Good</emphasis>, it is evident that
        depressions, anxieties and hypomanias are not limited to programmers,
        and actually predate programming by a long time. Many retired people
        also find themselves the sudden victims of these mental ailments.
        However, I feel that due to the bad state-of-the-art of software
        management in the world today, it is especially common there, than in
        most other jobs.

            Exercising and especially doing aerobic exercise (jogging,

            have never smoked, and have never consumed any of the currently
            illegal drugs, such as marijuana. While it does not prevent
            hypomanias, I find that it makes me less moody, more energetic
            throughout the day, and allows me to sleep better at nights. (I had
            also tried to refrain from eating sugary foods, but I couldn’t

            helpful for keeping a good self-esteem. It’s especially important
            during anxieties.  Listening to music, sitting, thinking and doing
            nothing, taking a time for leisure at the computer, are useful for
            relief from troubling thought.

                    And, naturally, my hypomanias have been catalysts for most

            It would be a good idea to write the ideas down, or even work on
            realising the essays or articles, because it makes one less excited
            and calmer. I would be a good idea not to publicise them in public
            until you’re well out of a hypomania, because they may prove to be
            immature or silly in the short-run.

            I personally may have sometimes been rejected from jobs because
            of the many things I’ve written and placed online, and which are
            easily accessible using a Google Search.  I don’t mind that because
            I feel that expressing and publicising my creativity is more
            important than making myself a better job candidate to some
            “attractive” jobs. And some employers seemed to be very impressed
            by some of what I wrote online, or at least did not mind that, and
            these seem like jobs I prefer.

            It is naturally a good idea to receive as much commentary as
            possible about one’s articles or writings in private before
            publicising them for all the Internet to see.

It is a good idea to admit that you’re “stressed” - anxious, etc. My therapist
said that the word “hypomania” is intimidating because it contains the word
“mania”, so one should rephrase it in case the other party is not that
knowledgeable about Psychology. Sometimes you may find some of your
friends or family (but not all) good candidates for consulting with your
thoughts or feelings. I once spent an hour or so on an IRC (= Internet
Relay Chat) conversation listening to a 19-years-old whom I knew, talking
about her problems. I also consulted people on IRC or IM about my own issues
and often found creative solutions or empathy.

<para>
This is doubly correct for talking with my family members.

        <para>
            During a hypomania, it is a good idea to maintain a low online
            profile.  Namely, don’t post too much to mailing lists or other
            forums, don’t chat on the IRC too much (and try to focus on
            technical problems or your psychological situation), and in general
            try to maintain a low-profile.

            However, I feel that real-life meetings with people and talking
            to them face to face is actually very good for one’s well-being
            during a hypomania.

            So if you can get a friend or a few to meet with you in a café ,
            or go to a club meeting, it will be a good idea.

        <para>
            It is my impression that often the philosophies and idea systems
            that we are generally exposed to (e.g: most western religions),
            are very harmful for one’s self-esteem and prevent one from
            properly getting out of depressions.
        </para>

        <para>
            An example for this is what the New Testament says in the Sermon
            of the Mount: <quote>But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh
                on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her
                already in his heart.</quote>. As I explained before, people
            have no control over their immediate emotions and should
            not feel guilty for possessing ones that they may consider
            bad. While most Christians I’ve talked to about that, did not
            think that what that means is that lust was as morally condemnable
            as rape is, this has been traditionally interpreted as such,
            and is how I interpret the meaning of the this verse.
            And naturally, this is just a small example.
        </para>

        <para>
            Therefore, I suggest you instead study and adopt a more benevolent
            psychological philosophy, which will help give you enough tools
            to live your life more happily and to deal with clinical
            conditions as they arise. My personal favourite is
            <link xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/guide-to-neo-tech/">Neo-Tech</link>,
            which is an extension and re-organisation of
            <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">Ayn
                Rand’s Objectivism</link>, with many vital corrections.
            However, I do not rule out the premise that different personal
            philosophies will be better for different people.

            It’s possible that if you’re a university student or a

        In <link xlink:href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Tapestry">the
            <emphasis>Star Trek: The Next Generation episode</emphasis> “Tapestry”</link>,
        Captain Picard dies and then is
        given a choice to revert an incident in his past that has caused him
        an injure which would have eventually caused his death. After he does
        that, he discovers that he is no longer Captain and that he have
        lacked the self-motivation that was needed in order to become the
        hero that he  used to be. As a result, he says that “I would rather
        die as the man I was, than live the life I just saw.”
    </para>

    <para>
        Or consider <link
            xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller">Helen
            Keller</link>, who was born deaf-blind. If she had been born
        normal, she would most likely have led a happy life. On the other
        hand, without her disability, she might not had become the superwoman
        that she did, because there would have been nothing to motivate her.
    </para>

    <para>
        Would I rather lead a normal life? Yes, I would. But, on the other
        hand, I recognise that getting into hypomanias is part of who I am,
        and probably the price I have to pay for being so creative. While I
        would like to reduce its effect, I thank God (so to speak) for
        allowing me to be able to write so many articles and essays, compose
        so many stories, and being a capable programmer.
    </para>

    <para>
        So I guess the curse and the blessing are part of what makes me who
        I am.
    </para>

    <para>
        Nevertheless, as I noted earlier, it is probably possible to combat
        the harmful effects of Bipolarity or Unipolarity as much as possible
        using Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy and other means, and I intend
        to work on that. It is my hope that you are now wiser on how to
        better deal with such harmful psychological moods, in case
        you have been suffering from them.
