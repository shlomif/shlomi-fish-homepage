                        Of course, if SkyNet actually did exist in the future,
                        a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would
                        be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have
                        played Terminators in popular films and television
                        series, lulling us into a false sense of security,
                        i.e., that’s Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor
                        Chronicles. No, Summer, don’t kill me! I’m pro-robot!

                            Sheldon, I owe you an apology. Taking the train
                            was a stroke of brilliance! I’ve actually got a
                            shot at a Terminator

                            got a better shot of scoring with Arnold
                            Schwarzenegger.

                            You’re overlooking something. I have 11 hours with
                            her in a confined space. Unless she’s willing to
                            jump off a moving train, tuck and roll down the
                            side of a hill, she will eventually succumb to the
                            acquired taste that is Howard Wolowitz.
