        <para>
            Your assistance is required in producing the feature film
            <link xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/">Summerschool at the NSA</link> based on my original
            screenplay. The screenplay is made available under the

            is original. I have designated my

                for some the cast</link>, and the film can be filmed
            mostly or entirely in a film studio.
        </para>

        <para>
            Note however that I’ll be
            accepting of any productions whatsoever of the screenplay,
            including
            by enthusiastic independent film makers, on YouTube,
            and including releasing them as voiced animations.
        </para>

        <para>
            I also don’t mind and encourage any hacks and deviations on the
            original screenplay, up to and including
            <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger">Arnold
                Schwarzenegger</link> sending <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna">Rihanna</link> to

        <para>
            What I do not want is that nothing is going to get done and that
            there won’t be any film - by anyone - in the forseeable future.
            So please get to it ASAP. I need you, and the world needs you.

            The open content / Web 2.0 revolution has proven to be a blazing
            success and a source of decent or better income, esteem,
            and publicity for many individuals, small companies,
            large companies, and other organisations. While during the Web 1.0
            era, information was hard to find, not reliable, and often hard
            to contribute to (what Prof. Lawrence Lessig calls "read only"
            vs. "read/write" in his book
            <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_%28book%29">Remix</link>, which I read and loved.), in the Web 2.0 era, one can
            build upon information, change it, enhance it, and perform
            many remixes as well as
            <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover">crossovers
                and “mashups”</link>.
        </para>

        <para>
            It is my belief that it was I, Shlomi Fish, who was the
            <link xlink:href="http://plus.google.com/+ShlomiFish/posts/gyrcAfAASev">“Hacker
                King”</link> (a.k.a “Warrior King/Queen/Monarch” / The
            best-of-the-best-of-the-best / The Saladin / The Qoheleth / The
            John Galt /etc.) of that revolution. To quote what Quark said
            about
            the <link xlink:href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Grand_Nagus">Grand
                Nagus</link>: «Oh believe me, the Nagus has the greatest
            business mind in the entire Ferengi Alliance, always thinking ten,
            sometimes twenty steps ahead of everyone else.»
            and the kind of person who has <link
                xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=same-ideas-as-everybody-else">the same ideas as everyone else only five
                years earlier</link> and thus is named a lunatic.
        </para>

        <para>
            Nevertheless, my reign as Hacker Monarch has reached its end
            with the writing of the screenplay, <link
                xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/">Summerschool at the NSA</link>.
            The latter mixed and matched Judaism (Tanakh, Talmud, and Israelism),
            Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the
            <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xkcd">xkcd</link>
            web comic, the “99 problems” meme, the old
            “Publish or Perish” adage,
            the deeds and words of
            <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Shlomif/Saladin_Style">Saladin</link>,
            open source and open content, some
            modern but not unthinkable technology,
            sex/love/romance/relationships, pop culture, and humour, and
            more into what
            was essentially a realism story starring Sarah Michelle Gellar,
            Summer Glau, and General Keith Alexander as themselves. Furthemore,
            I ended up seeing it as my modernisation of
            <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged">Ayn
                Rand’s Atlas Shrugged novel</link> (while still building upon
            it, referencing it and going against it), which was her
            magnus opus as Hacker Monarch.
        </para>

        <para>
            Like Atlas Shrugged, “Summerschool at the NSA” was eventually
            understood to be my magnus opus, and I passed the baton to
            someone else, Summer Glau, and thus mostly concluded the
            open content/Web 2.0 revolution with a happy ending.

                            Do you wish to become the Hacker Monarch,
                            while being fully aware of the implications
                            of this role, and taking full responsibility for
                            it?

                    a plain brown ten-sided die, and ask her to determine
                    what to do with it. I urge her not to lose it or destroy
