Spark - Pre-Birth of a Modern Lisp
==================================
Author: Shlomi Fish

Introduction
------------

Spark is a Modern dialect of Lisp currently being planned. This document is
not a formal functional (much less technical) specification for it, but rather
a briandump of some of the conclusions I (= Shlomi Fish) have reached
about the fundamentals of its behaviour. Nevertheless, some preliminary
(and still subject to change) specification of it will be given and some
code examples will brought.

Beside contemporary Lisp dialects such as
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp[Common Lisp],
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29[Scheme]
and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_%28programming_language%29[Arc],
Spark draws a lot of inspiration from other modern languages, paradigms, and
technologies including http://perl-begin.org/[Perl 5],
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_6[Perl 6],
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29[Python],
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29[Ruby],
Java and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29[Haskell].

Some Spark Essentials
---------------------

These are some of the guiding elements in the design of Spark.

Spark is not another implementation of Scheme (or Common Lisp)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are far too many implementations of Scheme out there, and probably too
many of Common Lisp. However, that is beside the point that we did not come
to praise the existing dialects of Lisp, by implementing them again.

Spark will be a completely different dialect of Lisp. It won’t be compatible
with either Scheme (or any of its implementations), Common Lisp or even with
Arc. It will still be Lisp, though, as we hope you will see.


Spark will be a dynamic (so-called “scripting”) programming language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spark will be an alternative to such languages as Perl, Python, Ruby,
PHP, Tcl, Lua or io-language, which are all very different but have APIs
to achieve similar ends and are used for similar tasks. Like them and
Lisp (which is one of the oldest dynamic languages) it will be able to
determine a lot of behaviour at run time and will support dynamic
“eval”, call-by-name
, run-time typing, run-time change of type for a datum,
multiple dispatch, polymorphic macros and other features of Lisp
and other dynamic languages.

Some people have been referring to Perl and friends as "scripting
languages" but that implies they are only useful for scripts. See:

http://xoa.petdance.com/Stop_saying_%22script%22

While that article by Andy Lester illustrates the problem with labelling
programming languages as “scripting languages”, I still think saying
“script” and “scripting” is a valid way to distinguish a trivial program
from an application. For example +/usr/bin/gcc+ is essentially
a script written in
ANSI C, which just passes controls to the various compilation stages. When
we type +gcc+ at the command line, we are running this script that does the
hard work of doing the compilation for us. (+/usr/bin/gcc+ should not be
confused with GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection which is a compilation
framework for C, C++ and other languages, and is a crucial piece of the
open-source UNIX-like operating systems infrastructure).

For an “in your face” anti-thesis to the aversion to call languages scripting
languages see Larry Wall’s “Programming is Hard. Let’s Go Scripting”:

http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2007/12/06/soto-11.html

Spark aims to be popular and be actively used for real-world tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While other general purpose Lisps such as Common Lisp, Scheme, Arc or
Clojure have been influential and have some followers and users, none of them
are actively used with the same popularity as Perl, Python, Ruby or PHP are.
Spark aims to be a popular lisp dialect which will be actively used for
real-world tasks, not just toy or experimentation code.

Eventually, it is our hope that some people will get paid to maintain Spark
code. Some of them against their best preferences, like some people now are
maintaining Perl 5, PHP or even Python code while preferring a different
language. (Simply because it puts bread on their table, and they cannot get
paid to write something else.)

Python? Yes! Google for example has been hiring several Perl 5 or even Perl 5
and Perl 6 programmers and instructing them to program mostly in Python. I’ve
known two or three of them myself. Many of them tolerate or even like Python
enough to program in it, but many of them still prefer Perl and consider
themselves as Perlers at heart. But Google gives very good conditions and
many Perl programmers (despite a huge demand for them) are treated badly
or have advanced to better paying positions. And naturally a lot of the
“younger generation” (most of them) bought the hype that you shouldn’t need
to learn Perl if you already know PHP, or Python or Java or whatever.

In any case, Spark aims to become roughly as popular as any of Perl/PHP/etc.
It is not guaranteed that we succeed , but we still would like to try.
What can we do to increase our chances?

Paul Graham has written about http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html[what
makes a language popular]. Arguably, he failed to make Arc as popular as
he wanted, even after it was released (and may have violated some of his
own guidelines), but the guidelines in the article are still sound
(ad-hominem anecdote put aside).

One can spend a lot of time expanding on Graham’s points and adding more stuff
(including possibly good timing and luck and possibly a lot of financial
backing can help, which most open-source enthusiasts don’t have).

However, it is important to note that this is our ultimate goal. Some languages
didn’t have a lot of financial backing before they got popular - Perl, Python,
PHP and Ruby are examples of it. Can we do the same?

None of the P-languages are perfect. Someone on #scheme gave me a moderate
list of must have items out of which Perl, Python, PHP and Ruby each violate
at least one and Scheme and Common Lisp none. I can quote him here as the
channel is publicly logged.

I’m not going to try to violate any of them (or any of the many common sense
“never-do-it”’s that PHP alone has violated, to say nothing of the rest) on
purpose in hope it will save me from the evil eye of having a decent language.
But I don’t think languages succeed because they are bad but because they offer
at least one awesome advantage. For example Perl 1 offered the ability to write
pseudo-shell scripts in a much more robsut and powerful way than awk, sed, sh
and csh and a much easier way than ANSI C did. (Although still very primitive
by the standards of Perl 5.). By the time Perl 4 was abandoned in favour of
Perl 5 , Perl 4 was already the de-facto standard for clueful
sys admins who valued their sanity. And I recall when Perl 5 was the only
real solution for writing CGI scripts that you could use because I was hired
to work as a web developer at that time.

PHP was similar enough to Perl 5 to fool people into believing it was adequate
(while messing up the internal behaviour and core language royally) and offered
more ubiquity as far as setting up on web-hosts was concerned (which Perl 5
is still trying to catch up). You can now download very powerful and gratis
content management systems in PHP (and other gratis web applications) and
run them out of the box on your cheap hosting and call yourself a webmaster,
which would be hard with any other UNIX-based solution. PHP as a language
has many issues, but they got some parts of the implementation needs right,
and this is what made it popular.

We need to find some good reasons for people to become hooked on Spark.
Spark probably won’t be perfect because I am not perfect and don’t know all
there is to know about language design. However, neither are
Scheme and Common Lisp. But even if Spark doesn’t have so many quirks like
PHP or Perl (or even Python) it should be an attractive platform for people
to experiment with, write scripts in daily, write toy programs and serious
applications, and then one day we may get a killer app like Ruby’s Ruby on
Rails.

(Hopefully, we won’t get the added RoR hype, which I admit is based on
viral marketing and community efforts, but was hype nonetheless. Perl and
PHP were never strongly hyped, and they seem to have been doing fine without
it.)

Spark does not aim to compete with C and friends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spark does not aim to fill the same ecological niche as ANSI C, C++
Objective-C, etc. - much less assembly. ANSI C and friends have been the
de-facto standard for writing applications when some or all of certain
constraints have been met:

http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/when-c-is-best/

While their use have lately been diminishing somewhat due to the increasing
attractiveness of the Java or .NET frameworks or the various dynamic
languages (Perl/Python/PHP/Ruby/etc.) they are nevertheless still very much
in vogue and even the backends for the more high-level virtual machines
are written in C and C++ .

There have been some efforts to compete with C and C++ on their own turf
such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28programming_language%29[D]
or http://www.ecere.com/[Ecere] (and earlier efforts such as Ada 95, or
Object Pascal) and they can be commended for that, but unlike them, Spark
does not aim to replace C in most of the valid use cases for a C-like
language.

Spark will have a rich type system but won’t be strongly typed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like Common Lisp, Python, Ruby and Perl 6 and to some extent unlike Perl 5,
Spark will have a rich type system. However, it won’t be strongly typed like
Haskell. If Spark had been going to be strongly typed, it could no longer have
been considered a Lisp, and I happen to like dynamic typing.

A variable can be assigned different values with different types during its
run-time, and functions would be able to accept variables of any type
(unless they specifically forbid it).

The Spark type system will be extendable at run time, and will be analogous to
its Object Oriented Programming (OOP) system. As a result, one would be able
to call methods on pieces of data, on expressions, on S-expressions, and
on functions, macros, classes and method declarations, and on their
application.

In Spark “everything will be an object”, but unlike Java, it won’t be
overly-OO. One won’t need to instantiate a class and declare a method
just to print “Hello World” on the screen. This will work:

------------------------------------------------
$ spark -e '(say "Hello World")'
------------------------------------------------

Or:

------------------------------------------------
$ spark -e '(print "Hello World\n")'
------------------------------------------------

Or:

------------------------------------------------
$ spark -e '(-> "Hello World" say)'
------------------------------------------------

+->+ Is a simple macro that converts +(-> obj method args)+ to
+(method obj args)+ and is used for some syntactic sugar.

Spark will be capable of being used for Scripting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While Spark should not be called a scripting language, just as the name is
a misnomer for Perl 5 or for PHP, it should in fact be capable of writing
scripts, including command line scripts at the prompt or the REPL
(Read-Eval-Print-Loop). Here are some examples for command line scripts. Most
of these are taken from the descriptions in http://www.catonmat.net/blog/awk-one-liners-explained-part-one/[Peteris Krumins’ "Famous Awk
One-Liners Explained"] series (which is now in the process of being
augmented with “Famous Perl One-Liners Explained”). I’m not going to study
the Awk implementations due to lack of knowledge in Awk and lack of will
to learn it as I already know Perl 5 - its far superior superset, but I’ll
implement something similar in Spark (Hopefully, Peteris will feature a
“Famous Spark One Liners Explained” feature in his blog someday
too).

Line Count:
^^^^^^^^^^^

------------------------------------------------
$ spark -e '(foreach (fh ARGV) (++ i)) (say i)' [Files]
------------------------------------------------

Line Count Reloaded
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

------------------------------------------------
$ spark -e '(: say len getlines fh ARGV)' [Files]
------------------------------------------------

+(: ... )+ serves the same purpose as Haskell’s +$+ - to chain function
calls without too many nested parameters. So this script is equivalent
to saying:

------------------------------------------------
$ spark -e '(say (len (getlines (fh ARGV))))' [Files]
------------------------------------------------

But is shorter and cleaner.

Double-space a file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

------------------------------------------------
$ spark -pe '(say)'
------------------------------------------------

(Think Perl)

Number lines in each file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

------------------------------------------------
$ spark -ne '(say "${^LINENUM} ${^LINE}")'
------------------------------------------------

Here we can see the string interpolation of variables in action.
+${....}+ interpolates a single variable, while +$()+ is an
S-expression. Aside from that spark will also have sprintf,
http://metacpan.org/release/Text-Sprintf-Named[sprintf with named
conversions similar to Python] and something as similar as possible to
Perl’s Template Toolkit (while still being Sparky). I find Common
Lisp’s +format+ to be hard to understand and much less flexible than
Template Toolkit so I’m going to drop it.

Like in Perl 5 the +^VARNAME+ variables are reserved and
are usually in all-capitals. Unlike Perl 5 (or Common Lisp), we are not a
Lisp-2 and we use the same symbol namespace for everything (like Scheme). So
we can put assign a lambda
(could be  +(fun ... )+ , +(sub ... )+ , +(lambda ...)+ or
+(function ... )+ - all exact synonyms) to a variable and call it with a
value:

---------------------
(my square)
(:= square (fun (x) (* x x))) ; Or (<- square) but I’m hazy about (= square)
(say (square 5)) ; Prints 25 followed by a newline.
---------------------

Like in Perl 5, however, a symbol table has an arbitrary amount of slots which
we can put values. So we can say:

---------------------
(say :to (fh STDERR) "Warning, Will Robinson.")
---------------------

Which will print to STDERR.

In the case of the +:to+ named parameter to +(say)+ (or to +(print)+ or
to +(printf)+ or whatever we have or define) we don’t need the explicit
+(fh ...)+ (= file handle) call but it won’t hurt.

Note about command line magic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Out of convenience the +-e+ and the rest of the +-p+, +-n+ , etc. flags
will involve some magic manipulation of the S-expression inside -e or inside
the script. It also loads some convenient modules. However, sometimes we may
wish to convert a command line script to a full application. That’s what
the +--dump-code=code.spark+ flag is for. It dumps the code of the program to
a file containing code that can be run with just +spark code.spark+.

For example:

---------------------
$ spark --dump-code=say.spark -pe '(say)'
$ cat say.spark
(no strict) ; you should probably remove that.
(use re)
(use cmd-loop)
(cmd-loop.set-implicit-print 1)
(say)
$
---------------------

Like all examples here, this is just for the sake of the illustration. Until
version 1.0.0 comes out, everything can change. But the concepts will remain
the same.

We encourage Perl, Ruby and other dynamic languages with rich command line
interfaces, to steal the +--dump-code+ idea. Maybe one day someone will become
a multi-millionaire from selling a 300K Lines program that evolved from a
simple +spark/perl/ruby --dump-code=code.... -e '....'+ invocation (after
a successful plain +-e+ invocation).

Spark will have nested namespaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spark will have a similar namespace system to Perl 5, with nested namespaces,
and the ability to selectively import symbols from namespaces at run-time.
Similarly to http://metacpan.org/release/Sub-Exporter and as opposed to
C++ where importing symbols from namespaces is an all-or-nothing operation,
and so mostly unusable.

As opposed to Java one would be able to import several symbols from a
namespace at once and grouped by tags. +Sub-Exporter+ gives much more than
that for Perl 5, but I don’t recall all the details from the slides I saw
about it. +:-)+ .

Like Perl 5 one will be able to import symbols at run-time.

As opposed to Perl 5, classes won’t be automatically associated with
namespaces, and a namespace may contain one or more classes (or none).
Like CPAN and unlike Java (+org.apache.jakarta...+), we will not enforce
namespace purity, but hopefully there will be a better mechanism than the
current CPAN and PAUSE (Perl Authors Upload Server) to be able to fork,
spin-off, or branch CSAN distributions or choose between competing
alternatives. http://cpan6.org/[CPAN6] (orthogonal to Perl 6) is worth
a look for some ideas, as is http://www.cpan.org/misc/ZCAN.html["The Zen
of Comprehensive Archive Networks"]

Spark will be more succinct than most Lisps, but not overly terse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One thing notable about Scheme and Common Lisp is that many identifiers
and keywords there are excessively long. ++(string->integer)++ ,
++(lambda)++ , ++(concatenate)++ , etc. Yes, you can easily assign aliases
to them, but it:

1. Takes time to write and more time to maintain.

2. Will require you to carry and update a meta-syntactic package in all your
code.

3. Would make your code harder to understand to the unfamiliar.

So Spark will provide short identifiers for most common operations (either
macros or functions) by default. There won’t be too many long aliases because
they will increase the core and require more time to learn and become familiar
with for the uninitiated, but some of them will be considered.

For example, a variation on my favourite Scheme statement is:

---------------------
(vector-set! myarray idx (+ (vector-ref myarray idx) 2))
---------------------

Which in Perl is:

---------------------
$myarray[$idx] += 2;
---------------------

And in Spark would be:

---------------------
(+= (myarray idx) 2)
---------------------

Which isn’t much worse than Perl. We’re not trying to beat Perl 5, Perl 6
or much less J in code Golfing in every case - this isn’t a peeing contest.
We’re just trying to make easy tasks easy.

Furthermore, while *\+=*, *-=*, */=* and friends will be defined there
will be a macro (that will be used defined by the prelude and used there)
to define your own +${op}=+ operators. Like +(list=)+ or +(myfunc=)+.

And as you see we will try very hard that every sane expression can become an
lvalue.

And in case, you’re worried there will be a “\+\+” and “--” operators too,
with post-increment/post-decrement and pre-increment/pre-decrement variations.

Finally, by inspiration from Arc, we decided to do something about excessive
parens. So we will have a +(with (k1 v1 k2 v2 k3 v3) .... )+ scoping instead
of the unwieldy Scheme +(let*)+ and +(letrec)+ (both will be easily
replaceable
by +(with...)++ with some macro or VM trickery.). And we’ll have a C-style
for-loop instead of the obscure +(do...)++ and a while loop, and a
Perl 5/Perl 6-style foreach loop, and maybe other loops too. And you can
always use recursion.

However we’re not going down the Arc route of assigning extremely short,
and hard to pronounce and grep for identifiers. +(fn)+ How do you pronounce
it? fnn.... There’s no such sound in Hebrew, so it’s verboten by your
Hebrew-speaking overlords. We like +(fun...)+ because it puts the fun back
in function (“Functional!! Parallelism!!!!” - oh wait! Wrong language.), and we
like +(sub ...)+ because it puts the “sub” back in subroutine. And all Hebrew
speakers will rejoice because they can pronounce +“cat”+ exactly like +“cut”+
and Perl like Pérl and Lisp like Leesp, and they can pronounce TeX and
LaTeX with a honest-to-god http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaph[khaph] (or a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heth[Heth] if they put their mind to to it.),
and the God of the Israelite Programmers saw there were only 5 and a half
vowels and he was pleased.

Seriously now, I don’t like (fn) because it’s hard to pronounce, doesn’t sound
right when you read it to your mind’s ear, and is obnoxious. While being
succinct is a noble goal, picking psychologically-sound and intuitive
conventions is also important. I recall searching the Arc tutorial and
documentation for a +(not)+ function only to found it was spelled +(no)+:

----------------
(if (no soup) (print "soup is false"))
----------------

“If no soup”. Oh no, no! No soup for you. *For one year!!!* We’re going have
(not) like everybody else, and also a “!” alias .

-------------------
(if (not soup) (print "soup is false"))
-------------------

-------------------
(if (! soup) (print "soup is false"))
-------------------

So we’re going to borrow stuff from Arc, but only when it makes sense. Spark
should have an up-to-date documentation manual right from the very start,
which will be kept as up-to-date as possible, and naturally will have automated
tests, which would serve as automatically verifiable examples. Arc really
had none, and often you needed to read the implementation code, or one of
the example web applications.

Spark will be written in plaintext
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What do I mean? +sbcl+ forces to write a long command line just to run a
program from the command line and exit. Arc was not better and could not
execute a program directly. I added this functionality to the Arc git
repository myself.

No, the REPL won’t be gone in spark, and good old +(load)+ will still be
there. But you can also do:

-------------------
$ cat hello.spark
(say "Hello World!")
$ spark hello.spark
Hello World!
$
-------------------

Or put /usr/bin/env spark or whatever in your sha-bang and it will work.

A spark program will do its thing, execute to the finish and gracefully exit.

We will still have a REPL, that can be used from the command-line or from
within Emacs SLIME or within IDEs such as Eclipse. Even Vim/gvim may get a
REPL if it gets something like an embedded shell like Emacs has.

Spark programs can be abstract syntax trees, a network of objects, some
compiled bytecode or flying unicorn ponies who drop candy. Nevertheless,
they are still read from text. If you want to change the state of REPL until
you forget what it has now or it changes unbeknowest to you
(“Parallelism!!!!”) it’s an option. But you can still write your tests,
run, debug, change, run debug, etc. Hopefully with automated tests for
extra bonus points in Software Management sainthood.

Regexps and other important elements have dedicated syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

But don’t worry - it’s in the “re” module and it uses read-macros/ char-macros
/ text macros. With the help of such macros one can even create a parser
for Ruby-style syntax (or Perl’s - +;-)+), but it’ll be actively
discouraged.

So for example:

---------------------
$ spark -pe '(~ ^LINE (re.s {ba([zro])(\s+)mozart} ma$1$2bozart))'
---------------------

And it will replace the first +baz[whitespace]mozart+ with
+maz[whitespace]bozart+ , etc. The +\~+ operator is similar to Perl 5’s
+=\~+ or perl-5.10.0’s or Perl 6’s +~~+ or in that it does a smart matching
of a datum (which could be a list) to an abstract operation.

We can also use other delimiters instead of +{...}+ in the +(re.s...)+
read macro:

---------------------
$ spark -pe '(~ ^LINE (re.s /ba([zro])(\s+)mozart/ ma$1$2bozart))'
---------------------

C/Perl/etc. conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Spark will be case-sensitive

2. Unicode (UTF-8) aware-and-safe

3. With C-style escapes - backslash does the right thing.

Spark will not encourage a proliferation of implementations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As you all know Lisp is a family of languages, which includes Lisp, Scheme
Arc, Emacs Lisp, etc. and some people may say also Dylan, and that Perl 5,
Perl 6, Ruby, Python and most other modern languages have many Lispisms in
them up to being able to translate many programs written in Lisp to them
line by line. (http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html[See Paul Graham Revenge
of the Nerds for the inspiration])

However, some people on irc://irc.freenode.net/#scheme[#scheme] told me
that Scheme, due to the proliferation of incompatible implementations, was
not one Lisp dialect, but a family of languages called “Scheme” with a
common denominator. While I’m all for
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages[Germanic languages]
being a major sub-division of
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages[Indo European languages],
also with several mutually incomprehensible languages, I’m not sure I want
a “Scheme programming language”-family within Lisp. It generally shouldn’t
happen with “man-made” and computer-understood languages that are more under
our control.

As a result, I’d like Spark to remain a single language with only a few
implementations, possibly only one for each target virtual machine (e.g:
Parrotcode, the JVM, or the .NET CLR, or a C-based interpreter). Spark will
be defined and compatible even in its internals, its foreign function
interface, and “standard library” (which will also have something more
like CPAN is for Perl 5, where every J. Random Hacker can upload their
own INI parser, under a different namespace), and core functionality.

Spark will have an open-source source code (GPL-compatible BSD-style or
possibly partially Artistic 2.0 in case some of the code is derived from
Parrot code), which naturally can be span-off, branches, and forked. However,
none of them pose a threat to the fact that the Spark implementation will
remain unified.

If someone changes Spark in incompatible ways, it may either die, or forked
into a new language. This language will also be Lisp and may be Spark-like
but it won’t be Spark. Perl 5 which only has one major implementation
(+perl5+ - currently at +perl-5.10.0+), recently span off
http://metacpan.org/release/kurila[kurila] which is fork of perl 5 that is
incompatible with it and with Perl 5, on purpose. Nevertheless, while
Kurila may be considered a a language in the Perl family, it is not Perl 5
any more than Perl 4 , Perl 6 , http://sleep.dashnine.org/[Sleep] or whatever
are. So Perl 5 has still not become a family of incompatible implementations.

Another factor that will dissuade people from creating multiple implementations
of Spark is that as opposed to Scheme, creating a Spark implementation from
scratch is not going to be trivial. It’s not that Spark will be needlessly
complixified, but that it would be needfully complex to implement to be an
expressive, feature-rich and high-quality language.

To quote Bjarne Stroustrup (the creator of C++ ) from his
http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bs_faq.html#Java[FAQ question about Java]

[quote, Bjarne Stroustrup, FAQ Question about Java]
__________________________________________________________________________
Much of the relative simplicity of Java is - like for most new languages -
partly an illusion and partly a function of its incompleteness. As time passes,
Java will grow significantly in size and complexity. It will double or triple
in size and grow implementation-dependent extensions or libraries. That is the
way every commercially successful language has developed. Just look at any
language you consider successful on a large scale. I know of no exceptions, and
there are good reasons for this phenomenon. [I wrote this before 2000; now see
a preview of Java 1.5.]
__________________________________________________________________________

(I should note that, like many other FOSS hackers, I normally prefer ANSI C
over C\++ , and am not a big fan of C++ for most stuff. However, Stroustrup
is a wickedly smart guy, and despite whatever faults his language may have,
he speaks straight, and what he says here seems to make a lot of sense).

Spark hopefully won’t be as complex as C++ is today from the beginning,
but will also be more complex than Scheme to allow for better expression
and faster development. It also doesn’t aim to be an incremental improvement
over Scheme (or Common Lisp) which seems to be the case for Arc
and Clojure, but rather something like Perl 5 was to Perl 4 or Perl 6 is
to Perl 5 : a paradigm shift, which Lispers and non-Lispers alike will
appreciate.

The first version of Spark will not be the ultimate Lisp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some features of Common Lisp or other Lisps will be absent in Spark, some
things will be harder to do than Common Lisp or even other Lisps or other
non-Lisp programming languages, and some things will not work as expected
at first (bugs, etc.). A lot of it will be caused due to the fact that the
primary author of this document does not consider himself a Scheme expert
(and is very far from being a Common Lisp expert) and just likes Lisp,
Perl 5 and other languages enough to want to promote them.

As a result, some estoric features of the popular Lisp languages today or
some languages that he has not fully investigated yet, won’t be available
at first. This is expected given his ignorance, enthusiasm and anxiety
to get something out of the door first.

While he would still be interested in learning about whatever core library or
meta-programmatic features other languages have that may prove useful for
the core Spark language (or alternatively cool APIs that you think should
be ported to Spark). But he has little patience to learn entire languages
“fully” (if learning any non-trivial language fully is indeed possible)
before starting to work on Spark. And often ignorance is a virtue.

So the first versions of Spark will still have some room for improvement.
Most of it may hopefully be solvable using some meta-syntactic or
meta-programming user-land libraries (as is often the case for Lisps and
other dynamic languages). As for the rest, we could consider them bad design
decisions that still add to the language’s colour and make it a bit more
interesting to program in than a 100% perfect language. Sometimes perfection
is in imperfection.

Why Lisp Has Been Unpopular
---------------------------

Mark Jason Dominus gives
http://perl.plover.com/yak/12views/samples/notes.html#sl-39[a case study called “Why Lisp Will Never Win”]
in his “Twelve Views of Mark Jason Dominus”. He gives the following awk
one-liner:

------------------
awk 'BEGIN {FS=":"}; $6=="/sbin/nologin" {print $1}' /etc/passwd
------------------

Which a member of comp.lang.lisp suggested that Lisp should implement
something similar to. The response was that "with only a couple of new utility
macros & functions", it could become:

----------------------
(with-lines-from-file (line "/etc/passwd")
    (let ((fields (string-split line :fs #\:)))
        (when (string= (aref fields 5) "/sbin/nologin")
            (format t "~A~%" (aref fields 0))))))
----------------------

Which as Dominus notes is a little over 2.5 over the length of the awk program.
(but still required these macros). Naturally no one will opt to write it
instead. So the problems with Common Lisp is ground-up verbosity, lack of
common idioms for commonly performed tasks, and lack of motivation to use
it for common, everyday (sometimes even throwaway code).

So what will it look like in Spark?

-----------------------
spark -inaF/:/ '(if (= (^F 5) "/sbin/login") (say (^F 0)))' /etc/passwd
-----------------------

(we borrowed the +(array idx)+ notation from Arc, because an array ref object
is overloaded with a method to get the index.

Some Implementation Details
---------------------------

These are some implementation details that are still subject to change:

Virtual Machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I’m leaning towards making the initial Spark implementation use
http://www.parrot.org/[Parrot] as its virtual machine. http://llvm.org/[LLVM]
was suggested, and while it seems nice and powerful, it requires the compiler
front end to be written in C/C\++ which will cause the time to market to grow
considerably. I don’t rule out a later implementation of Spark to LLVM, but
during the initial implementation we would like to change things rapidly and
quickly, and C or C\++ will slow us down considerably.

I’m not keen on using the Java Virtual Machine, due to Java’s long historical
reputation of being “enterprisey” and non-hacker friendly (see
http://www.paulgraham.com/javacover.html ), and due to the fact it has a slow
startup time, and that it feels very “sluggish”/non-responsive. Again, I don’t
rule out a future port of Spark to the JVM.

The Parrot VM seems very suitable for dynamic languages, and it is progressing
nicely. The http://www.parrot.org/languages[Parrot languages Page] already
lists several implementation of Scheme which can serve as the basis for
a Spark implementation, so I’d like to start there.

Spark Licensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since we’re building on Parrot, the licence of the non-original code will be
the Artistic License 2.0, which is free, open-source, GPL-compatible and
somewhere between a weak copyleft licence (e.g: the LGPL) and a permissive
licence (e.g: the 2-clause or 3-clause BSD licences). The original code
will be written under the MIT/X11 licence, which is a very permissive
BSD-style licence that specifically allows sub-licensing. To avoid legal
confusion, every file should contain an explicit “Licensing” notice to
indicate under which license it is.

Test-driven development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As opposed to Arc, which shipped with no automated tests, Spark will be
developed in a Test-driven development fashion. Namely, it will have a
comprehensive test suite that will need to fully pass upon any commit to the
trunk (or “master” or whatever the main branch is called).

The code of the tests is not expected to be authoritative for how the final
version of the language will behave. Rather, some future design decisions will
require changing the code of a lot of the tests accordingly.

I still don’t have a clear idea of how to design a lot of “big picture”
Spark design decisions. While I believe that design is good, I also think
that Spark should be designed incrementally, and that we can expect many design
decisions to change. Test-driven development, while accepting the fact that
often a lot of testing code will need to be modified, will allow us to do
that.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is our plan to keep documentation for the Spark language using POD,
PseudoPod, AsciiDoc or a similar language so people will be able to learn it,
without the need to delve into many tests or the core code itself. The
documentation will be kept mostly up-to-date, but we can expect it to grow
somewhat out-of-sync with the code.

We’re not planning to make exhaustive documentation - for example, the
internals of the front-end will not be very well documented, as they will
tend to get out-of-sync with the code, and in general the code should be
structured to be self-documenting and easy to understand using refactoring.
