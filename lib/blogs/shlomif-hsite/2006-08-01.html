<h2>Bio now also Available in Hebrew + Update to “Which Wiki”</h2>
<p>
Another day, another update:
</p>

<p>
I added <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/personal-heb.html">a translation
    of my Bio to Hebrew</a> and in the process
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/personal.html">updated
    the English original</a>.
</p>

<p>
I wrote <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/web/which-wiki/update-2006-07/">an update to the “Which Open Source Wiki
    Works for You” article</a>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I’d like to thank “zero cool” for pointing out a small typo in this
blog which was also placed on the front-page. Thanks!
