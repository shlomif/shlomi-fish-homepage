<h2>What’s New on Shlomi Fish’s Homepage</h2>

<p>
Here are the recent updates for Shlomi Fish’s Homepage. The first item of
note is that I implemented an automated test suite for the site, with a
test for lack of trailing whitespace, and a spell checking test
(powered by
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Text::Hunspell">Text::Hunspell</a> and
<a href="http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/">Hunspell</a>). The many problems
pointed by these checkers were fixed, resulting in a very large patch to
review this time.
</p>

<p>
Aside from the spelling corrections, here are the items of interest:
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/">meta section</a> now
has a section navigation menu.
</p>

<p>
I added the incomplete geek parody song
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Im-The-Real-Tim-Toady/">“I’m
    the Real Tim Toady”</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    May I have your attention, please?<br />
    May I have your attention, please?<br />
    Will the real Tim Toady please match up?<br />
    I repeat: will the real Tim Toady please match up?<br />
    We’re going to have two problems here.

<p>
jnoakes’ page about
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/grad-student-jokes-from-jnoakes/">Graduate
    Student Jokes</a>, which I have enjoyed, and which has gone offline,
has been restored on the site:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>You know you’re a grad student when…</b></p>

<ul>
<li>you can identify universities by their internet domains. </li>
<li>you are constantly looking for a thesis in novels. </li>
<li>you have difficulty reading anything that doesn't have footnotes. </li>
<li>you understand jokes about Foucault. </li>
<li>the concept of free time scares you. </li>
<li>you consider caffeine to be a major food group. </li>
<li>you've ever brought books with you on vacation and actually studied. </li>
<li>Saturday nights spent studying no longer seem weird. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/text-processing-tools/">A
page with a List of Text Processing Tools</a> has been added to the software
resources sub-section.
</p>

<p>
There are new additions to the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html">Aphorisms and quotes collection</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If it isn’t in my E-mail, it doesn’t exist. And if the whole world says one
thing and E-mail says another, Email will conquer
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Said to me in a private conversation by an Israeli Linux enthusiast.)</p>

<p>
There are also some new quotes in the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/">Chuck
Norris Facts</a> page:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Chuck Norris is the reason why the Knights who until Recently Said “Ni”, are no
longer saying “Ni”.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Finally, there are some new
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">fortune cookies</a>:

<p>
Enjoy!
