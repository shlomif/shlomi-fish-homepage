CMake Talk Summary:
-------------------

Introudction:

    CMake - cross platform make.
    - configure the software build process and generate makefiles (or IDE 
    project files) automatically on many systems.
    - Advantages over GNU Autotools.
        - Smaller archive files and downloads (no huge "configure", 
        "configure.in"/"configure.ac", Makefile.am, Makefile.in, etc.)
        - Faster configurations (using the CMake command).
            - no excessive forking and running processes in CMake.
        - make/build runs faster (due to no "libtool" commands).
        - much easier to maintain and tends to break less than Autoconf's
        m4 macros generating /bin/sh code, with many other tools in between.

        - Better Microsoft Windows support:
            - can prepare Windows NSIS packages out-of-the-box.
        - Its licence is mod-BSDL instead of Autotools' GPL.

Core language:
    - A Specialised Domain-Specific Language (DSL) with an interpreter written 
    in C++
    - Turing Complete.
    - Supports Lists.
        - separated by ";".
    - $VAR expands lists.
    - "$VAR" expands a string into a single variable.
        - Use it when it doubt.
    - Sometimes variables are accessed by name and sometimes by their value.
        - read the documentation to be sure.
