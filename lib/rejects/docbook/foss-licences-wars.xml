        <title>In the Beginning - there was the Public Domain</title>

        <para>
            As computers became more popular after World War II, people
            started writing software for them and sometimes distributing it.
            This software written in Machine code, Assembly, or more portable
            high-level programming languages, enabled people other than
            the original author to run the code and make use of it.
            The traditional "licence" for such software was
            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">the
                Public Domain</ulink>, which is a legal term in the United
            States and other countries that describes what becomes of
            an intellectual artwork whose (limited) copyright term has
            expired. As traditionally understood, a Public Domain artwork
            can be freely distributed (commercially or non-commercially),
            freely derived from and included in future artworks, and freely
            used and enjoyed. As a result, such software was generally
            free-for-all-to-use.
        </para>

        <para>
            That's not all. In fact, as many computer workers at that point
            in hisotry understood, it was unnatural for software to be
            copyrighted and be under any licence except for the Public Domain.
            Evidence for this can be found in <ulink
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists">Bill
                Gates' "Open Letter to (Altair) Hobbyists"</ulink>,
            where he expressed dismay on them contacting him about copying
            his company's version of BASIC for the Altair (an early home
            computer), instead of buying it for money.
        </para>

        <para>
            Non-public-domain software (from now on "proprietary" or
            "non-free" software) actually preceded Gates, and was common on
            mainframe (LINK) or mini-computers (LINK), which were the
            very big (and in today's standards' - incredibly under-equiped)
            computers that preceded the now common microprocessor-based.
            However, there was still a strong tradition of what we now
            called open-source software back then. See for example,
            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHARE_%28computing%29">the
            SHARE group that shared software for IBM-based computers</ulink>.

    <section id="history--unix-and-bsd">
        <title>AT&amp;T UNIX, BSD, and the BSD Licence</title>
        <para>
            The original UNIX was an operating system originally created by
            AT&amp;T's
            Bell Labs Workers for Digital Equipment Corporation's (LINK)
            PDP-11 (LINK) computers, based on earlier
            efforts, which was distributed along with its source code in
            the C programming language to interested parties across the
            world.
        </para>
        <para>
            One of the hallmarks of AT&amp;T UNIX was that despite the fact
            that its source code was not fully-open-source (see below)
            in today's standards, it was still a fully functional operating
            system distributed along with its source, which rapidly gained
            popularity.
        </para>
        <para>
            Eventually, several workers in the University of California
            in Berkeley started working on their own version of Unix, based
            on AT&amp;T's. This was called "Berkeley Software Development"
            or BSD for short. The licence for its original parts became
            known as
            <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bsd_license">the
                BSD Licence (or BSDL or even "BSD" for short)</ulink>
            and according to its popular distribution was public-domain-like
            in the sense that it allowed free modification, redistribution,
            and conversion of derived code to any different licence.

            <footnote id="bsd-licences-footnote" title="OrigBSDL">
                <para>
                    The
                    original BSD licence had an "advertising clause" that
                    required the one who distributes or modify the code to
                    advertise its use by the copyrights holder. This clause was
                    later deamed as undesirable, and non-GPL-compatible by the
                    Free Software Foundation due to the proliferation of people
                    that require attribution. Therefore, it is now recommended
                    to use the so-called "Modified BSD Licence" with 3-clauses
                    or the further modified one with 2-clauses, which are both
                    GPL-compatible.

        <para>
            The BSD licence has proved to be popular for other software
            written for UNIX-like operating systems (and open-source
            software in general). Later on, several variations on this
            licence were initiated and also become popular.

            In 27 September 1983, <ulink
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard

            software", where free is as in "free speech", rather than as in
            gratis goods. From what I understood <ulink
                url="http://lwn.net/Articles/161270/">based on what
                Bruce Perens said</ulink>, what he meant "free software" was
            at the time not conclusively defined, and that the so-called
            <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">"Free
                Software Definition"</ulink> is a much more recent document,
            that aimed to provide an anti-thesis to the open-source
            definition.
        </para>
        <para>
            Stallman opted against using the BSD licence for the original
            software created by the GNU project and instead phrased his
            own more restrictive licence entitled <ulink
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">the
                "GNU General Public License"</ulink> (or GPL for short),
            and used it for GNU's software.

            The GPL is a relatively complex licence with many fine points.
            I admit that I did not fully understand version 2.0 of the GPL
            back when I tried to read it, and know what I know about it
            by reading knowledgable sources.

                    only be linked against code with free software licences
                    that match some criteria. This property has been recently
                    referred to as "viral".

                    Despite the first item, GPLed software can be made to
                    run on operating systems and other platforms, whose
                    licences are not incopmatible with itself, including with
                    proprietary, or even binary-only software.

            The GNU Project began to work on software programs and libraries
            to replace or complement, existing ones in the proprietary UNIX
            world, and most of them were placed under the GPL. The GPL
            was adopted for other software released on the Internet and
            elsewhere for Unix and non-Unix operating systems, but some
            people still released software under public-domain-like licences,
            such as the BSDL, the licence of the MIT X Window System
            (so-called MITL, MIT, X11L or X11) and the pure Public Domain.
        </para>

        <para>
            This co-existence of the GPL and Public-Domain-like licences still
            exist to this very day. One should note that some software
            released for UNIX-like OSes, along with its source, have carried
            different or even non-free-as-in-speech/non-open-source licences
            altogether.
