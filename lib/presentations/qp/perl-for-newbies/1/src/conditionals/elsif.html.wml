<p>
The full syntax of the if statement is as follows:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/conditionals/elsif.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
The N-th <tt>elsif</tt> block will be executed only if all the conditions 
in the previous blocks were not met <b>and</b> its own condition was met.
</p>

<p>
You can do the same with nesting <tt>if</tt> statements inside <tt>else</tt>
statements, but isn't it nice of perl to save you all those extra brackets
and indentations?
