<p>
There’s <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/COBOL-the-New-Age-Programming-Language/">a
new parodical page titled “COBOL - The New Age Programming Language”</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
NASA Uses COBOL.
</p>

<p>
And so do:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Your bank.</li>
<li>Your insurance company.</li>
<li>Your government.</li>
</ul>

<p>
COBOL runs your life.
</p>

<p>
A new page
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/javascript/">“Don’t Abuse
    JavaScript!”</a> has been added.
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
JavaScript has become popular due to being useful for scripting browsers, which
is acceptable due to being the only commonly-acceptable portable choice for
that. However, lately, it has been utilised as a host language for many other
realms where there are far saner and superior alternatives.
</p>

<p>
This page aims to explain why JavaScript should not be abused for such stuff.
