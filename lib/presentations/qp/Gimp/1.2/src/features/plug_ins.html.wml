<points>
<li>
In the GIMP, effects and filters are implemented using plug-ins.
</li>

<li>
Plug-ins are separate programs that communicate with the main GIMP program
using pipes.
</li>

<li>
Most of the plug-ins that are distributed with the GIMP are GPLed, but
it is legal and possible to write proprietary plugins.
</li>

<li>
Aside from plug-ins written in C, GIMP ships with Scheme and Perl Extensions,
that enable writing filters and scripts in these languages.
