<p>
Welcome to another edition of the Shlomi Fish’s homepage news.
</p>

<p>
I added <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/#irc_part_message">another
    question and answer to my FAQ</a>, this time about my IRC parting message.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/technion-bit-1.html">A funny
    Technion-originated and related bit (not by me and in Hebrew)</a> was
added to the humour section.
</p>

<p>
There are <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">new fortune
    cookies in the fortune collection</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/bits-and-bobs/square-waves-decomposition/">Two
    programs to perform a decomomposition of a sine wave into square waves</a>
are now available in the open-source bits-and-bobs section.
</p>

<p>
New links have been added to
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/">the against Bad software
    pages</a>, and <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/no-ie/">the Stop Using
    Internet Explorer</a> page was especially revamped:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    <b>Internet Explorer does not have a public, accessible bug tracker</b>,
    similar to Mozilla’s Bugzilla or what other similar browsers have. This
    makes bugs harder to report, reproduce, check and track and undermines the
    users and web developers.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There’s <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/interviews/">a new page
    containing links to interviews with me</a> and
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/blogs/">the weblogs page</a> was
updated.
</p>
