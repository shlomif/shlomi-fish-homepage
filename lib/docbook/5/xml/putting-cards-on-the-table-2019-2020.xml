<para>
This essay aims to present a summary of a snapshot as of 2019 of my personal
philosophy and ideology, titled
<link xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/#rindolfism">Rindolfism</link>,
which is dynamic and subject to change.
</para>

<para>
I am really tired of having truly intellectual people like me "speak in
riddles" and be somewhat dishonest, so I'd like to put as many of the cards I
have now on the table. There will likely be more into the future, and moreover, honesty
is a process and a person should strive to become more honest as time goes by.

<para>
While it had earlier occurrences, I derive this piece of wisdom from
<link xlink:href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/">Saladin</link>, a Muslim king and conqueror of Kurdish descent who is legendary
for being one of the most effective warriors, and one of most noble and merciful people
in history.
</para>

<para>
During Saladin's time <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)">Palestine</link> which is also known as "The Land of Israel" or
"The Holy Land" was ruled and terrorised by <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar">Knights Templar</link>. These were Christian conquerors
originating from Europe, who were psychotic, psychopathological, vicious, sadistic, and vandalist, who would have put <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany">the Nazis</link> much less today's
<link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</link>
or <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant">ISIL</link> to shame, and harmed the civilians in Palestine and
were feared by them.
</para>

<para>
Saladin acquired a large army of loyal warriors, who all joined him by choice,
had superior swords to those of the Knights Templar, and lighter armour, and he
set out to release Palestine from the Knights fortress by fortress.  But the
most amazing thing is that he told the knights something like that:
</para>

<blockquote>

<para>

You can fight me or you can surrender. The choice is yours. Do what you want,
you don't have to do what you think you have to. If you choose to surrender, I
will spare your life, disarm you and let you walk to Christian-controlled
territory. If you choose to fight, I will try my best not to kill or harm you,
and then swear you not to fight me any more, and let you walk to
Christian-controlled territory.

</para>

<para>

I trust you will make the right decision and entrust you with power.
Whatever your choice will be, I'll accept it.

</para>

</blockquote>

<para>
While some knights were probably killed, many of them survived and became
happy, sane, and while ostensibly Christian, unwilling to fight Saladin.
Even if their religious leaders told them to return, Saladin accepted that
oath breaking and said he'll fight them again, which caused his Knights
Templar opponents to fight extremely poorly, and be quickly disarmed, after
which they learned their lesson, and would not fight Saladin again.
</para>

<para>
By letting people do what they want, they will likely do the best thing
they can do. This is management by not managing and parenting by not
parenting, which is and always was the best way.
</para>

        <title>Big minded ("Rosh gadol") vs. Small minded ("Rosh qatan")</title>
        </info>
        <para>
        The Israeli military was small and as there was a lot of work to do
        to properly secure the Israeli civilians it coined the terms
        <link xlink:href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/12/06/news-45/">Rosh
        gadol ("big minded") and Rosh qatan ("small minded")</link>
        to encourage the soldiers to take initiative and try to perform their
        jobs as well as possible, regardless of the fact they were paid little.
        </para>
        <para>
        This extends to non-military work, government work, and voluntary work or hobbies and
        endeavours: if you care about something, do it as well as possible and
        give it enough time as needed. It will get easier and faster in time.
        </para>

        <para>
        For instance, a vendor on a candy store or an icecream parlour, should
        try to greet the customers, be friendly to them, offer recommendations
        to them if they ask, accept business cards with their personal web sites
        or social media presence and visit them, and generally treat every customer
        like royalty.
        </para>

        <para>
        If you do this, you'll likely get more returning customers, bigger tips,
        bigger bonuses and raises, and you may be able to land a better job
        based on a warm recommendation from your superiors and coworkers.
        </para>

        <para>
        The opposite is just following orders blindly, "i just work here"
        attitude, which is no different from the Nazis'
        <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders">Superior
        orders - "I was only following orders"</link> which leads to laziness,
        stagnation, vandalism and sadism, just like the German Nazis in
        World War II, or
        the Knights Templar in Saladin's time.

        <title>Hacking and Heroism vs. Conformism and Tragedy</title>
        </info>
        <para>
        As you may have read <link xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#david_and_goliath">the David who fought Goliath was a hacker</link>
        and it was modernised in <link xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anEuw8F8cpE">the famous scene from Indiana Jones</link>
        where Indy shoots a master swordsman using a gun instead of
        struggling with him. Hacking or heroism involves breaking or
        bending as many invisible rules as possible and not accepting
        your "fate" (which is usually death) and this applies both
        to fiction and to real life.
        </para>
        <para>
        The opposite of hacking is conformism where you accept all the normative
        rules of society, fear your own shadow, and stagnate and die, possibly
        by <link xlink:href="https://studybible.info/ABP_Strongs/Judges%2016:30">taking many innocent people's lives with you</link>.
        </para>
        <para>
        As a result, eccentricity and "craziness" are the road to a happy life,
        not conformism as widely believed.

        <title>Great Hackers</title>
        </info>
        <para>
        A great hacker is an action hero that is aware enough of the essence of
        hacking to become a greater and greater hacker, despite whatever
        limitations he or she may have, and despite whatever setbacks they
        may run into.
        </para>
        <para>
        Despite common belief what happens when you put a great hacker (whether
            male or female) in a secluded place with many minor hackers or
        conformists, is not one crushed great hacker, but rather many
        great hackers, who spend time effort and conscious thought on
        satisfying their customers, peers and superiors. That is the
        "fox in a chickens' coop" motif as exemplified
        in <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_(Genesis)">the
        story of Joseph in prison in the Bible</link>,
        that of <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milady_de_Winter">Milady de Winter in "The Three Musketeers"</link>, who despite
        appearances to the contrary was the epitome of hacking and good
        and is my epitome of sexiness in fiction. Finally,
        in <link xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/">my "Summerschool at the NSA" screenplay</link> a fictionalised
        Summer Glau (the actress who is notable for being <link xlink:href="https://xkcd.com/406/">featured in xkcd: Venting</link> ) is the fox (pardon the pun) who devours
        the hens of the fictionalised NSA.
        </para>
        <para>
        Currently, I, Shlomi Fish, am doing the same in real life in a
        top security Israeli psychiatric ward where I was hospitalised for being
        non normative, and doing some foolish stuff. It works surprisingly
        well, and I'm using the collected wisdom of
        Moses→Saladin→Ayn Rand→the Beatles→Sesame Street→web 2.0
        blogs and sites→My Little Pony / Taylor Swift and my own intuition and
        trial and error.
        </para>
        <para>
        Note that some great hackers were clearly fictional (e.g
        <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda">Yoda</link>,
        <link xlink:href="https://www.geekwire.com/2011/top-10-reasons-darth-vader-amazing-project-manager/">Darth Vader</link>,

        <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Piggy">Miss Piggy</link>
        or even <link xlink:href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Fluttershy">Fluttershy</link> ),
        some were female (e.g: <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Bernhardt">Sarah Bernhardt</link>
        , <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand">Ayn Rand</link> and
        <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift">Taylor Swift</link>)
        and some were underage (most notably <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Temple">Shirley Temple</link>
        and <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaulay_Culkin">Macaulay Culkin</link> ). So don't let
        anything stop you.
        </para>
        <para>
        Even our period's canonical "anti-geek", <link
        xlink:href="https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Penny">Penny</link>
        from the popular sitcom the Big Bang Theory, is a wonderful great
        hacker, as evident by her constant "hacks" (or <link xlink:href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse#Dispelling_in_the_Selinaverse">"dispelling"</link>) of the show's more stigmatic geeks' rules and prejudice.

        <para>
        Traditionally in history some great hackers have become so powerful
        that they took over the direction of the world and became a singular
        source of greatness. This is even though some of them were clearly
        or presumably fictional.
        </para>
        <para>
        In <link xlink:href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Nagus">the article about the Grand Nagus in Star Trek DS9</link>
        , Quark is quoted as saying  «Oh believe me, the Nagus has the greatest
        business mind in the entire Ferengi Alliance, always thinking ten,
        sometimes twenty steps ahead of everyone else.» and this is similar for a hacker
        monarch who is often ahead of the curve.

Following the Summer Glau "termination", it was believed that there now can be
several simultaneous hacker monarchs, and that people can try to become ones while
not dethroning (or <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic_transit_gloria_mundi">sic transit gloria mundi</link>) the previous hacker monarchs.
</para>

<para>
Note that even a hacker monarch may be fallible. Socrates almost got himself killed several times
until he willingly drank the poison. Plato and Aristotle said equally blasphemous things, but
learned from Socrates' fate and worked on a better delivery so both died as highly reverred and respected. The same story
repeated itself with Galileo and Isaac Newton.
</para>

<para>
Many Hacker Monarchs were two steps forward and one step back, like the fact Ayn Rand was
anti-Open and anti-Amateur and <link xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=neo-tech-selfishness">confused
selfishness with rational self growth</link>. So if you have a criticism against even the greatest
hackers, voice it - we <link xlink:href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/">can only benefit from it</link>.

    <para>I discovered the song <link xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTBx-hHf4BE">"One Tin Soldier"</link> - an anti war song from 1969, by accident through <link xlink:href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pachelbel-rant">Rob Paravonian's Pachelbel Rant</link>.

    However, this is wrong because we should encourage people to be
    more able and more competent, and be less needy. So assuming we
    wish people to be more able,how do we measure it?

    <orderedlist>

    The first measure of ability is <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money">Money</link> - the more money you have the more goods you can
    afford and the more free time you have to do creative works.

    <para>
    The second measure of ability is <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1175430272130650112">Fame</link>, the more people heard about

    The third measure is "luck" which is which opportunities

    <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Hilton">Paris Hilton</link>, who was the canonical "alpha female" in the world throughout
    many years between 2000 and 2014, as incompetent, talentless,

    that she was the opposite on all of these and if she utilised

    Now here is something interesting: there is a strong correlation between

    </info>
    <para>
    We were discussing <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Apple's Swift language</link> the other day
    on <link xlink:href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#gnu">#gnu</link>
    when I told someone there that he should charge 300 USD/hour for swift
    projects because he disliked them so much. I also said the high
    fee may yield <link xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=joel-camels-rubber-duckies-11">a higher demand</link>.
    Then I had a browser window open with the top Twitter accounts
    and <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift">Taylor Swift</link> was there and I noted she likely charges more than 300 USD/hour
    for her live shows. He told me that he wished she will sue Apple
    for trademark violations of the supposed "swift" trademark and win.
    I joked that if "Apple sued Taylor Swift for violation of their Apple
    Swift language's trademark they will spend all their money in the
    bank on litigation and still lose." Ha ha only serious.
    </para>
    <para>
    I then realised that Ms. Swift has become a <link xlink:href="#hacker-monarchs">Hacker Queen</link> by that time. While I think her face is good eye
    candy, she is not that beautiful in my opinion (but I think she looks
        <link xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdneKLhsWOQ">much
        better with black hair</link> than with her trademark
        blonde hair). Nevertheless, there are many things we can learn from her.
        </para>
        <para>
        First of all is that she exemplifies the <link xlink:href="#amateurs">amateur
        model</link>, because she does stuff for fun, rather than for money.
        </para>
        <para>
        Her videos despite often being popular probably
        do not offset their production value in ads, but they are good publicity,
        provide fodder for remixes, parodies and covers, and are fun enough to produce so she can afford
        to offset the cost. She doesn't work for money or even for a shitload of
        money. She works for fun.
        </para>
        <para>
        Moreover, Taylor is an unapologetic <link xlink:href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attention_whore">"attention whore"</link> who often spends large amounts of
        money or even also time in activities that will make her look like
        a better person	or more well known.
        </para>
    <para>
    Otherwise, Taylor Swift is a great philanthropist who likely
    <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1175578541292957696">also donates to friendly individuals</link>
    and realises that one should <link xlink:href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-1.htm">"cast your bread upon the waters"</link>
    to quote the wonderful Biblical scroll of <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</link>.

    My <link xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#chuck_norris">last analysis of Chuck Norris and the Chuck Norris factoids</link> turned out to not be the last word on the
    subject. It is well known than Norris took the facts to his advantage,
    and as a result became the most prominent actor in Hollywood (which
        I call "the Alpha Male"). However, shortly after that the factoids
    seem to have fallen out of favour and shortly after that,
    Norris announced that he retired from acting.
    </para>

    <para>
    Now, I still added factoids about <link xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/">other things to my collection</link>. Then one
    day in 2019, I was chatting on the #gnu chatroom on <link xlink:href="https://freenode.net/">freenode</link> and after giving someone some advice came by with
    a new factoid which I uttered there: "If Chuck Norris gives you some
    advice, and you do not follow it, he'll survive. However, you likely won't.", and to my surprise my fellow to the conversation, told me it was funny.
    Some days later I spent some time with my sister's husband, who is
    an artist and a film maker, and showed him some of the software
    applications and web services as well my own software or text works,
    which I was familiar with as a <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux (or rather "GNU/Linux")</link> user. Just when he
    and my sister were going away, I told him I had some factoids
    on my site about Chuck Norris/etc., and he told me he was a big fan of those.
    </para>

    <para>
    So what has happened?
    </para>

    <para>
    What I think happened is that Norris started playing (and
        fighting) in roles he liked, even if he didn't get paid or
    got paid relatively little, or was paid after the fact.
    He became a happy <link xlink:href="amateur">amateur</link>
    rather than an increasingly unhappy professional. I won't
    be surprised if he has agreed to appear at local schools' plays,
    and/or playing roles that were completely unlike his traditional
    Hollywood roles just because he liked them.
    </para>

    <para>
    As a result of that, I believe Chuck Norris, both himself and
    the fictionalised Chuck Norris Facts image, has become a
    new Hacker Monarch. Well Done!

    <link xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</link> is a video
    sharing site which you've probably heard of. While there are many
    official videos by signed artists or by the film owners' copyrights,
    there is also a huge ecosystem of original "direct-to-YouTube" art
    created by the so called "YouTubers" who upload anything from bootleg
    videos of songs, to technical tutorials, to low cost covers (often just
        a man or a woman singing and playing a guitar, a piano or even an electric
        organ or A cappella), to parodies, to lyric videos, to live recordings
    of any musicians or comedians.
    </para>

    Now, some people still look down on YouTubers thinking that covers can never

    One problem with YouTube is that many videos have been removed, or censored, or
    disappeared, or blocked in certain regions (often by automated

    <link xlink:href="https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</link>
    or similar downloaders to download every video that we like from
    YouTube, and while some die hard copyright puritans have looked
    down on that, I still support that as a way to battle censorship.
    </para>
    <para>
    Someone told me in a chat, that he believed that Google (who owns
        YouTube) will do a DMCA takedown for GitHub to censor youtube-dl,
    but even if they were stupid enough to do that (which I doubt), it
    would not stop youtube-dl, whose open source public domain source
    code has thousands of git clones and forks.

    While I do not condone the <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_headquarters_shooting">recent YouTube shooting</link> (by a woman

    by the aggressive and irrational content filtering and removal
    that many YouTube creators and users have been witnessing.
