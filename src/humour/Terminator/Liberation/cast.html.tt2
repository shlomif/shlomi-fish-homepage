<p>
On this page, I would like to note who I think should be the cast for some
of the characters of "Terminator: Liberation".

<p>
I'd like Whedon to direct <i>Selina</i> because I feel it should be directed
the same as the first three seasons of <i>Buffy</i>, before <a
href="https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Faith_Lehane">Faith</a> was eliminated and
the <a href="https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Scooby_Gang">Scooby Gang</a>
graduated from high school, and Buffy likely became a soap
opera. Anyway, while Buffy had very good special effects, the ones in <i>Selina</i>
may be somewhat more cheesy.
</p>

<p>
I believe more directors can and should direct parodies and <a

fiction</a> of their own works or franchises.

I originally wrote this argument for choosing Ms. Watson there:
</p>

<blockquote cite="">

<p>
Well, Selina has to be an Englishwoman, right? Otherwise, I feel that
Selina is similar enough to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger">Hermione Granger</a>
to warrant Ms. Watson playing her. Furthermore,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keira_Knightley">Keira Knightley</a>
plays the kind of females, who make the room miss a beat when they
are seen, which isn't what I want for Selina, who should be the kind of girl
that people should not feel intimated by.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
I think it was not the complete story as Watson's life paralleled both my life
as well as <a href="#kate">Kate Hampshire's</a> (only she was often better equipped,
either by her environment or by her own judgement, to avoid repeating some
of my mistakes.)

A logical choice.

Hannah is a geeky Israeli-born-and-raised Facebook friend of mine who shares a similar
height and complexion as <a href="#cast__emma_watson">Emma Watson</a>.
