        <title>Introduction</title>
    </info>

<para>
The “open source” movement is perhaps the most important phenomenon
in the software world today. Thousands of developers and
millions of users worldwide create, maintain, support and use
high-quality software packages, that are made available for everyone
to use, modify and distribute. Many Objectivists may reject this
movement on the premises of it being anti-Capitalistic in nature. The
aim of this document is to show that they need not and should not.
</para>

<para>
This document will demonstrate that working on open source software
is not anti-Capitalistic, and that it is also an objectively moral
and healthy activity. It will explain why there is no dichotomy between
the open source world and Objectivism, and why Objectivists can
support it, without having guilt feelings of behaving un-Capitalistically.
</para>

        <title>What is Open Source?</title>
    </info>

<para>
Open source is a relatively new name for a relatively old phenomenon that
is also called “free software”. (this term preceded “open source” but it
too came a long time after the phenomenon emerged). I have written
<link xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/foss-other-beasts/">a previous
introduction to this phenomenon</link> which I advise to read if you’re not
familiar at all with the term.
</para>

<para>
To sum up, an open source program is a program that is accompanied with
its original source code and can be freely used, modified, and re-distributed
without any charge. It is possible to charge money for a package that
contains free software components, but generally it is not economical to
base a business on it, because of the fact that it can later on be freely
distributed.
</para>

<para>
Some of the landmarks of the open source movement are the <link xlink:href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC-based
software development kit</link>, the
<link xlink:href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache
web-server</link> and other Internet servers, the
<link xlink:href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla
    project with its Firefox browser and other applications</link>, various high-level
languages such as
<link xlink:href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</link>,
<link xlink:href="http://www.python.org/">Python</link>,
<link xlink:href="http://www.tcl.tk/">Tcl</link> or
<link xlink:href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</link>;
the <link xlink:href="http://www.x.org/">X-Windows Graphics System</link>
 and desktops built on top.
There are also
several operating systems whose every essential component is open source.
They include the <link xlink:href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux (or GNU/Linux)
Operating System</link>, and some of the
<link xlink:href="http://www.bsd.org/">various
BSDs</link>
</para>

<para>
Open source software provides a low-cost, highly customisable, and often
more reliable or technically superior alternative to commercial, non-free
software. The open source world maintains an online web of mailing lists,
web forums, IRC channels, web-sites and other resources with which
people who are more knowledgeable in some respects help their less
experienced peers.
</para>

<section xml:id="what_is_objectivism">

    <info>
        <title>What is Objectivism?</title>
    </info>

<para>
Objectivism is a philosophy put forth by Ayn Rand, and later further
developed by others. It has a strong emphasis on individualism, objectivity
and Capitalism. Objectivism is based on the premise that existence exists
and is common to all conscious individuals independently of what anyone think
it is. As such it rejects such notions as Subjectivism (that reality is
subjective to any individual), and mysticism (that thoughts can alter reality).
</para>

<para>
One of the central themes of the Objectivism is that the conscious individual
is an end to himself, and should strive to fulfil his own happiness and
well-being. It demonstrates that by acting out of their rational self-interest
, individuals best benefit others as well.
</para>

<para>
Similarly it believes that Altruism (advocating the must to contribute to an
external cause) is a harmful notion that one has to reject from within
and without. Objectivism does not oppose individuals voluntarily
contributing time, effort, money or other resources to further the well-being
of others. However, it demonstrates that claiming that you are only worthy
of living if you help an external cause (the poor, your country, your
religion, etc) is a harmful notion that has caused a great deal of strife
in the world.
</para>

<para>
Objectivism Support Capitalism as the ideal way of running a country
and vows for Laissez-Faire Capitalism, as the ultimate form of it.
</para>

<section xml:id="about_neo_tech">

<para>
<link xlink:href="http://www.neo-tech.com/">Neo-Tech</link> is an idea
system based on Objectivism that also incorporates Psychology and Business
Management, and reaches even bolder conclusions. Summarising Neo-Tech
is not possible in this scope because the material put forth by it
is huge. It’s also not particularly relevant because this document is aimed
at Objectivists (and non-Objectivists) who have not accepted Neo-Tech yet.
</para>

<para>
However, I will borrow some concepts and text from the Neo-Tech literature
to demonstrate my points, and hope they will be commonly accepted enough by
everyone.

<section xml:id="two_levels_of_morality">
    <info>
        <title>Two Levels of Ethics and How Open Source Measures Against Them</title>
    </info>

<para>
There are two levels of Ethics: Ethos and Morality.
An ethical action is such that is allowed under objective ethics. I.e:
if you wish to perform it, then no-one can prevent you from doing it. It may
not necessarily be a good action to take, but it is still allowed. A
non-ethical action is such that will harm others and so is not allowed.
</para>

<para>
Now an ethical action is moral if it delivers genuine gain for
you or for someone else. This distinction should be made because some
ethical actions are very harmful (such as committing suicide or
consuming harmful substances).<footnote xml:id="amoral" label="Amoral">
    <para>
        Related to moral and ethical choices are amoral decisions. An amoral
        choice is a matter of taste and is neither moral nor immoral.
        Examples are: your favourite food, your favourite Ice-cream flavour,
        your preferences in members-of-the-appropriate-sex, your preference
        in music, etc.
    </para>
</footnote>
</para>


<para>
The aim of this section is to show that working on open source software is not
only ethical but moral as well.
</para>

<section xml:id="why_oss_is_ethical">
    <info>
        <title>Why Open-Source is Ethical</title>
    </info>

<para>
The best summary of what is ethical and what isn’t can be found
in the <link xlink:href="http://www.neo-tech.com/neotech/advantages/advantage83.html">
Neo-Tech Constitution</link>. This document contains a preamble, followed
by three articles, followed by 6 axioms. The articles are the most relevant
and I’ll bring them here:
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
No person, group of persons, or government may initiate force, threat of force,
or fraud against the person or property of any individual.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Force may be morally and legally used only in defence against those who violate
Article 1.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
No exception shall ever exist to Articles 1 &amp; 2.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
The validity of this definition is self-evident. Now, based on it, what
can we say about creating open-source software? It surely does not involve
initiatory force, coercion or fraud. Working on free software is done
voluntarily and its distribution does not involve harming anyone.
</para>
<para>
While vendors of commercial software may lose money or go out of business
out of competition with open-source software, it does not constitute of
force. Competition is one of the cornerstones of Capitalism. This is similar
to selling a cheaper and/or better product at the marketplace and taking
market share out of the competition.
</para>
<para>
Thus, creating and maintaining open source software is an ethical action.
</para>
</section>
<section xml:id="why_oss_is_beneficial">
    <info>
        <title>Why Open-Source Development is Moral</title>
    </info>

<para>
Naively, some Objectivists may come to believe that working on open-source
software is, while perfectly ethical, not a good action to take.
“You work on software that the masses could use, and instead of selling
it and earning a honest buck, you give it away to everybody, and have
others benefit from your efforts. What’s in it for you?” But let’s first
formulate a definition of what is moral and what isn’t.
</para>

<para>
Again, I will extract a suitable definition out of the Neo-Tech text:
</para>

<blockquote>
    <para>
        The meaning of moral in Neo-Tech is simple and direct: Whatever is
        consciously done to help fill human biological needs is good and moral
        (e.g., the productive actions of honest people). Whatever is consciously
        done to harm or prevent the filling of human biological needs is bad
        and immoral (e.g., the destructive actions of mystics and neocheaters).
    </para>
</blockquote>

<para>
The validity of this
definition is also evident. So how Open-Source measures against it? Very
well, actually. Open source software was so far used by millions of users
worldwide, greatly facilitated some of the jobs they had to do with their
computer, and generally contributed to everyone’s well-being. The very
action of creating a useful software for everyone to use is beneficial as
it eventually can help fill human biological needs.
</para>

<para>
Now, some hardcore Objectivists can ask “But what about your own
self-interest?”. Self-interest here is relevant, but in subversive ways.
The open-source developer does not economically benefit from the software
he wrote, as much as he would, had he sold it commercially (and assuming
it would indeed become successful). However, he does benefit, from having
more potential users and co-developers, from making sure his software or
one of similar vestiges will remain available as time goes by, and from
a boost of happiness knowing that people are using your software.
</para>

<para>
Usually, getting a non-free piece of software to become successful would
take a lot of effort on the developer’s part, and you always risk a
player with better resources competing with you. While it is itself beneficial
as well, it may not yield the same immediate and long-term profit from
working on an open-source package.
</para>
</section>
</section>

<section xml:id="beyond_morality">
    <info>
        <title>Beyond Morality: Why Open Source is Good for You</title>
    </info>

<para>
The reasons that make open-source a viable choice technically,
psychologically and economically were already given in
<link xlink:href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">Eric Raymond’s</link>
excellent <link xlink:href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">
“The Cathedral and the Bazaar” series</link>. In the first part,
<link xlink:href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">“The Cathedral and the Bazaar”</link>, Raymond describes the dynamics
of a small “Bazaar-style” open-source project, and analyses why
this system works so well for developing software.
</para>

<para>
In the second part, <link xlink:href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/">Homesteading the Noosphere</link> Raymond analyses the
customs of the open source community. He demonstrates that because of the
abundance of computer resources such as computing power, network bandwidth,
hard-disk capacity - there is no scarcity economics involved in the
Internet world. Instead, there is a gift culture, in which people are esteemed
according to what they give away (namely, contributions to open source
software)
</para>

<para>
The third part, <link xlink:href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/magic-cauldron/">“The Magic Cauldron”</link> analyses the economics of the
open-source world. It demonstrates why non-free commercial software is
problematic and why open-source works so well. It gives several cases in which
companies and individuals can utilise distributing software applications
under open-source licences for their own commercial gains. He also dispels the
myth that programmers will be out of job because of free software by
noting that the majority of code in the world (and what the vast majority
of programmers are working on) is code for internal use: in-house applications,
customizations of programs, embedded software, software that accompanies
hardware, software that powers web-sites, etc. Such software has no sale
value, and so its developers will not be damaged if open source takes over.
</para>

<para>
The whole series is a very recommended read.
</para>

<para>
<link xlink:href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</link> later
continued the Magic Cauldron theme in his essay
<link xlink:href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html">
Strategy Letter V</link>. He took the Micro-economics principle of
complementary products, and showed why supporting open-source software
can be a wise decision to make complementary products in greater demand. A
complementary product is one that when it is in greater abundance, demand for
its complement will become higher. For example, if flights to Florida became
cheaper, then there would be greater demand for Florida Hotel Rooms. Open
source software can be a complementary product to hardware or services
involved in supporting it, which explains why companies like IBM or Sun
are financing it.
</para>

<para>
Aside from all that, working on open-source software is a fun and rewarding
experience. One becomes more experienced and learn a lot, interacts
with users and co-developers (some of them living thousands of kilometres from
where you are), and generally becomes happy of having done something
useful.
</para>

<para>
Generally, the amount of work an open source developer invests in his
software is vastly negligible compared to the benefit he makes out of the
work of all the other developers. As someone once noted, in the open-source
model everyone contributes a brick and in return everyone gets a full house
for himself. By decentralizing effort, and splitting the development into a
large number of well-defined projects, the open source world ensures that
development is done at a highly accelerated pace.
</para>

</section>

<section xml:id="why_dichotomy">

    <info>
        <title>Why the Apparent Dichotomy Exists in the First Place?</title>
    </info>

<para>
Finally, it’s time to analyse why the apparent dichotomy between open-source
and Objectivism exists in the first place. The most important reason is
because some non-free software is sold, and because open source software
is made available for everyone to freely use and distribute. So, we see the
vendors of proprietary software as healthy Capitalists (which is true), and
automatically deduce that open source software is anti-Capitalistic.
</para>

<para>
However, software is different in the fact that the cost of duplicating
it and distributing it is virtually zero. A software developer is not
encumbered if his software has 100,000 of users instead of just 1,000.
While developing the software is time consuming, there is no reason not
to share it after one has invested this initial time.
</para>

<para>
Some people may come to believe that sharing anything is bad. But as
Eric Raymond notes in the excellent film <link
xlink:href="http://www.revolution-os.com/">“Revolution OS”</link>:
“Open source is voluntary sharing. Communism puts a gun against your head and
forces you to share.”. While sharing hammers or food does not make sense
economically because
such things take a positive amount of time to manufacture every unit of (albeit
sharing them is still perfectly ethical), sharing software is not encumbered by
these real-world constraints. That put aside, giving away something to your
friends, was not held as illogical even by Ayn Rand herself.
</para>

<para>
Another element that hinders the acceptance of Open Source software is the
belief that “if you want something good, you have to pay for it.”. This
myth does not hold in the software world, because an application can achieve
good quality by incremental contributions from its voluntary developers.
When a developer works on an application, there is the pure joy of creation
and other social rewards, and it does not matter if he makes any revenue
off selling the software. There is a similar case when developing other
types of artwork.
</para>

<para>
Alternatively, the entity that pays the developer to write the program
gains from other aspects of the software other than its sale value. (as
previously noted).
</para>

<para>
The facts also speak for themselves. The Linux operating system and other
pieces of open-source software (or for that matter freeware), have millions
of users who can testify for their superior quality and working experience.
</para>

</section>

<section xml:id="oss_and_capitalism">
    <info>
        <title>Open Source and Capitalism</title>
    </info>

<para>
Some may claim that the Open Source development methodology contradicts
Capitalism: after all, a final product is produced, and given away for free.
This is while the general theme of Capitalism is to competitively create
values that are sold in the marketplace.
</para>

<para>
A bit bucket once produced and finalised (a procedure that may require a lot
of money, effort and time), can be later distributed free-of-charge by
electronic means, without causing loss to the originator of the bit bucket.
This is as opposed to physical products such as food or tools, which cost money
to produce and distribute each unit of.
</para>

<para>
Thus, it economically makes sense to distribute software or other bit buckets
free-of-charge. The fact that vendors of proprietary software do it for money,
does not preclude a costless alternative by someone else. Capitalism has
endorsed distributing cheaper alternatives to products for a long time.
</para>

<para>
For a more thorough discussion of the economics of open source software refer
to Eric Raymond’s essay <link xlink:href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/magic-cauldron/">“The Magic Cauldron”</link>.

<section xml:id="community_and_collectivism">

    <info>
        <title>The Open Source Community and Collectivism</title>
    </info>

<para>
One of the corner-stones of Objectivism is its opposition to Collectivism.
Namely considering a collective of individuals as more important than its
individuals, or thinking that one should sacrifice the well-being or happiness
of individuals for the collective.
</para>

<para>
The open-source world exhibits a very prosperous, active and often zealous
community of users, contributors and advocates. Is this an instance of
Collectivism?
</para>

<para>
No, it is not. Collectivism is not against forming collectives. Some
collectives, like many countries, cities, and businesses, clubs and so on are
or can be benevolent. The only problem comes when the leaders of the collective
stress the welfare of the collective above the welfare of its individuals. This
is generally not the case for the Open Source community.
</para>

<para>
Moreover, the members of the Open Source community are active there at will.
There’s no force, threat of force, or fraud directed at anyone to convince
them to become an open-source user or activist. If people just use open-source
software because of its benefits or lower price, without contributing anything
back, it is considered OK and fully allowed by the licences of the software.
</para>

<para>
Thus, the open source community is not a collectivist phenomenon, and
participating in it should not be regarded as such.
