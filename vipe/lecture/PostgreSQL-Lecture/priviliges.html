<h1>Database Priviliges</h1>

<h3>
* PostgreSQL users can grant and revoke permissions to use or modify their
database data from other users.<br>
<br>
* The SQL commands GRANT and REVOKE are used for this purpose.<br>
<br>
* For example:<br>
<br>
As user postgres:<br>
</h3>
<pre>
test=&gt; REVOKE INSERT ON employees FROM shlomi \g
CHANGE
test=&gt; REVOKE DELETE ON employees FROM shlomi \g
CHANGE
test=&gt; REVOKE UPDATE ON employees FROM shlomi \g
CHANGE
</pre>
<h3>
<br>
Those commands made the table employees read-only for the user shlomi.<br>
<br>
Now:

</h3>
<pre>
test=&gt; GRANT INSERT ON employees TO shlomi \g
CHANGE
</pre>
<h3>
<br>
has given shlomi the permission to insert records into this table. (but not modify its existing contents or delete records).

</h3>
