At a certain time, when the PCs explore the first castle, they get a chance
to see their players. (“and now you will observe your true selves…”). While
they are seeing them they are very awe-inspired and excited. Afterwards, they
talk about all the things that changed in their players since the last time
they saw them. At the end Bryte says
“and did you see mine? Now she has a pony-tail.”

tries it one more time and the same thing happens. Then, he holds the knife by

its blade, and the entire tree from the bulls-eye downward gets compressed and
the tree flies at him.</p>

off its course, and it hits Bryte’s buttocks instead.</p>

<p>Bryte screams in pain and then shouts “You!”, and grabs Tilyo and throws
him. Tilyo travels the same path as the arrow and then hits the tree at its

<p>MRS - Musical Recognition Subsystem, a system that was created by Gon the
gnome and which performs operations based on the lyrics of the song which is
played.</p>

<p>To operate it the PCs make up “The Right Song” and “The Left Song” and
several other such songs. They sat sail on a boat which is controlled by MRS.
(They use “Go West” to get along and then turn right to go east.</p>

<p>Eventually they encounter a battle ship which attacks them. They use “Stop!”
by the spice girls to stop it, but then the battle ships shots at them. Then
they use the song “Fire”, but it sets fire to the boat. The boat runs into the
battle-ship and they both drown. The PCs and NPCs on the battle-ship swim out
to the shore.</p>

<p>The fire continues underneath. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the commander of the ship talks with the swashbuckler about how
he is going to explain what happened. The swashbuckler has some suggestions,
but then the commander says that he will simply tell that they ran into the
Blue Rabbit.</p>

<p>The bard and some of the crew are inventing a song called “Stop the fire” in
order to turn the under-water fire off. It goes to the melody of Back-street
Boys’ “Everybody (Back-street’s Back)”, with a novel arrangement.</p>

village.</p>

<p>We caught the rabbit, and it turned out it was just dipped in a blue dye. So
we concluded that it was a practical joke someone made.</p>

<p>Gon: How curious.</p>

<p>Clover: Yes, aside from that, a year and a half later, that same rabbit
metamorphosed into a hideous hydra that terrorized the village, and we had to
fight it. But we never knew if there was a connection between the two
cases.</p>

colouring the subject blue, a year and a half before.</p>

The PCs travel up north, and in a cold and desolate Tundra, are stopped by a
patrolling ogre guard who claims he needs to take their details before he kills
them. After telling him their details, the Ogre starts crying from joy, and he
hugs two of the PCs saying they are his heroes. Then he asks the PCs to follow
him, and they notice he has a purple neck.
</p>

<p>
Apparently, after Mordox had brought some Purple-necked ogres from the past,
they learned that they were going to become extinct and as a result, decided to
travel to desolate lands where they will be thought to be extinct but will
actually escape extinction.
</p>

<p>
The king of the Purple-Necked Ogres gives this speech:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Now that we are thought to be extinct, but are not really, the race of the
noble Purple-Necked Ogres can prove their worth to the world, and further
expand! This is all thanks to the “Blue Rabbit Adventuring Company” here,
for whom we are grateful [cheers].
</p>
<p>
So, Blue Rabbits, we like you and we would like to give you the key to
our kingdom. [cheers and yells from the audience]

Nonetheless, don’t even think we like humans. We God damn hate those weakling,

<p>
In Part II the Demonius Agitatus from Part I, appears in a smaller, but
still larger than the player characters, size, and invites them to his home
in the 3rd plane of Evil for a challenge in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_show">quiz show</a> about "real-life philosophy" with the
prize of getting to the "time travel parameters control room".
When they arrive at his home (before the quiz), they see a pleasant
European-style garden, and a table with chairs, and the demon offers
them some Raspberry tea.
</p>

<p>
In Part II the characters somehow get to a place where they can set the
parameters for time travel:
</p>

<ul>
<li>If the past can be changed or not.</li>
<li>If paradoxes that something was never invented but rather the original
idea came from an artefact that was brought from the future.</li>
<li>Whether artefacts that have been brought from time travel change due to
the changed time line.</li>
</ul>

<p>The PCs ask the supervisor if the control is stable, hence if you change one
thing and change it back it will return to its original position. He answers
that it isn’t. Then they ask him if it has a save and restore mechanism. He
answers that it does not.</p>

<p>
Then one of the PCs say “This is the worst User-Interface ever!” to which the
supervisor replies “Of course it is, we’ve won the <i>Worst User-Interface of the Year Award</i> for five years straight.”, and he shows them the
certificates.
