<p>
<get-var cpan_dist /> provides <b>Fiction-Text</b>, a lightweight
plaintext-based markup language, which can be used to write such fiction as
stories, novellas, or possibly even novels. Fiction-Text is in turn converted
to <b>Fiction-XML</b>, which is an XML-based grammar (which can be used
directly). Fiction-XML, in turn, is translated to such formats as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML">XHTML</a> and
<a href="http://www.docbook.org/">DocBook/XML</a>, for rendering by
web-browsers, and for conversions to different formats, including PDF.
</p>

<p>
Also provided are <b>Screenplay-Text</b> and <b>Screenplay-XML</b> which are
used for writing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay">screenplays
(or scripts)</a>, and can be translated to XHTML or
to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative">TEI-XML (Text
Encoding Initiative)</a>
</p>

<p>
<get-var cpan_dist /> is part of the <a href="../">Web-CPAN XML-Grammar
project</a> that provides several specialised processors for XML grammars
for various tasks.

<h3 id="news-2011-05-22">2011-05-22: <get-var cpan_dist /> version 0.5.1 is
out</h3>

<p>
There are many improvements in this release. Since the last news item here,
there were:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
New tags - <tt>&lt;ol&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;ul&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;li&gt;</tt>,
<tt>&lt;programlisting&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;a href=&gt;</tt> (the
latter for for hypertext.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Documentation improvement.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
An XSLT stylesheet to convert Screenplay-Text to
<a href="#similar_proj_tei">TEI</a> .
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Got rid of the <tt>&lt;!DOCTYPE…</tt> declaration in the Screenplay-XML
output. It made debugging difficult and was not necessary.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Add support for numeric entities such as <tt>&amp;#91;</tt>.
</p>
</li>

</ol>


<h3 id="news-2011-04-05">2011-04-05: <get-var cpan_dist /> version 0.1.5 is
out</h3>

<p>
This release has many small bug-fixes and improvements:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
The handling of a colon (“:”) inside a top-level description in
XML-Grammar-Screenplay was fixed.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Fixed the handling of an innerdesc on the start of a line in the middle of a
paragraph.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Add support for &lt;i&gt; tags in XML-Grammar-Screenplay.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Everyone are recommended to upgrade.
</p>

<h3 id="news-2009-11-25">2009-11-25: <get-var cpan_dist /> version 0.0.2 was
released</h3>

<p>
<get-var cpan_dist /> was released today, and should be available on CPAN
mirrors. This release features several improvements to the code’s
internals and automated tests suites. The external behaviour of the code
should remain the same, but the code is now much more malleable for future
improvements, and there may have been a few accidental fixes.
</p>

<h3 id="news-2009-11-05">2009-11-05: <get-var cpan_dist /> version 0.0.1 was
released</h3>

<p>
The first version of <get-var cpan_dist /> (v0.0.1) was unleashed onto the
world today. It was written for my own personal use as a writer of Hebrew
stories, but I naturally decided to release it as open-source software.
As first versions go, this version is rough on the edges, and has hairy
internals, and other warts, but still should be usable enough for people
who are clueful enough.
</p>

<p>
Happy <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo (National Novel
Writing Month)</a> and hopefully <get-var cpan_dist /> will prove of assistance
to you for this NaNoWriMo or future ones.
