<p>
It’s been 2 months since the last update. I haven’t been working on the
homesite as much as I used to, but still there are some updates worthy of
mention.
</p>

<p>
In the UNIX fortunes front, I added the 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/nyh-sigs">nyh-sigs</a>
file to the collection, which includes a collection of quotes from the
email signatures of <a href="http://nadav.harel.org.il/">Nadav Har’El</a>.
This waranted a new second digit of the fortunes-shlomif collection - 
and it’s now version 0.8.0. Moreover, several new entries were added to the
bottom of the 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/shlomif">shlomif</a>,
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/tinic">tinic</a>, and
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/shlomif-fav">shlomif-fav</a>
collections .
</p>

<p>
The puzzle section now features the 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/puzzles/situation/book-under-rock.html">“Book 
    under a Rock” situation puzzle</a> as well as 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/puzzles/cs/lotg/">the Lotg code</a>.
</p>

<p>
Two new <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/bits.html">“Bits and
    Bobs programs”</a> were added:
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/bits.html#kaddressbook_dist_lists">A KAddressBook porting script</a>,
and <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/bits.html#amarok">an Amarok
    script for recording per-song volumes</a>.
</p>

<p>
Several new CD recommendations were added <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/art/recommendations/music/">to the Music recommandations</a>. Furthermore,
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/books-recommends/">the Non-fiction
    Books’ Recommendations Page</a> was heavily revamped.
</p>

<p>
My <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/contributions/#error.pm">contributions 
    to Error.pm</a> are now mentioned in
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/contributions/">the Open Source
    Contributions Page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the entire site (including many obscure pages) was
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/18238.html">made to validate</a> and
many broken links were fixed.
