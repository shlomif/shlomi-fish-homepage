The origins of conciuosness and madness
---------------------------------------

It is well known that when individuals of most primate species (including
monkeys!) are separated from their group/tribe, they stop eating and drinking
and become unenergetic and can even die out of thirst or hunger. This
is a very similar phenomenon to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder in
humans.

In order to avoid it humans during their evolution developed a thought
process, where they hallucinated guiding thoughts or even voices of
"gods", "leaders", "rules", or even just "guidelines" to entertain them,
guide them, encourage them, etc. But they were nevertheless nonsentient.
