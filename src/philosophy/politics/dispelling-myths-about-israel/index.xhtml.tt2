<p>
While the southern part of Israel (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev">the Negev</a>) is a desert, most of the northern part has growth, and supports
a lot of trees, bushes, shrubs and fauna. There are <a href="http://www.israelimages.com/result2.asp?sql=%28Category%3D3+AND+Sub_cat%3D2%29&amp;keywords=&amp;cat=&amp;subcat=Flowers+%26+Plants&amp;r1=c2">many pictures</a>

[% WRAPPER h2_section id = "not_all_jews_are_haredi"  title = "Not all Israeli Jews are Orthodox (Haredi)"  %]

<p>
Most Israeli Jews are not Haredi Jews who dress almost completely in black.
In fact a lot of them are secular Jews who mostly don’t even wear a kippa,
or religious Jews who still lead a normal life. Religious Jews can be
distinguished by look by the fact that the males wear
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kippah">a Kippa</a>, and the females
dress dresses or skirts, instead of the usual pants or more fashionable
dresses that women wear.

<p>
While most of the Israeli-related news is about terrorist acts (or acts
of retaliation of the Israeli Defence Force against terrorist activity), Israel
is in fact a very peaceful and safe country. Here are several more serious
problems in Israel than terrorism:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
More Israelis were killed in road accidents, than all those killed in
terrorism and wars.
</li>

<li>
It has very high taxation (sometimes over 60% of the wage), many irrational
welfare laws, and a very poor middle class.
</li>

<li>
There are many irrational regulations.
</li>

<li>
There is a lot of theft, and other crimes.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Some Israeli soldiers (males and females) are required to carry a gun with them
during their service, but most don't. Moreover, Israelis who are not serving, are not required
to do that, and most of them do not make use of their gun-bearing rights
to carry a gun daily.

Israel has the 21st highest life expectancy in the world.</a>
