<p>
I woke up in the morning and went to the post. It was a bright day at the
beginning of spring. When I walked down the road that leads to the post, I
enjoyed the lively green of the field, before the summer shows its marks.
Flowers bloomed there in the colors of white, yellow and violet and I could
hear the squeak of the birds that resided on the trees and woke up before
morning. Drops of dew shined on the shrubs and flowers, and the ground was
still moist from the rain that had fallen there a day before. The sun just
began to shine and in the sky there was a war between the light-blue shade
brought by the sun and the dark red of the night. 
</p>


<p>
In my opinion, it was a perfect day to launch missiles at the Enemy’s
soldiers. However, that was no what I intended to do that day. 
</p>


<p>
As I came near the post I saw from afar that two of my comrades were oiling
one of the mortars that were in the possession of my post. They were so busy
that they did not notice me until they heard me say "Good Morning." to
them. 
</p>


<p>
"Good morning, the Member of the Organisation." They answered me while
turning to see me. "How’s it going?" added one of them. 
</p>


<p>
"Top of the world. I’m going to quit today." 
</p>


<p>
"Really? That’s a shame! ‘We’ll miss you, bro’, like they say." 
</p>


<p>
"Likewise. But we have to move on." 
</p>


<p>
And so I went from them, opened the door that lead to the office of the
post’s commander and went in. The commander sat by the table and read a
pamphlet of pages that he held in his hand. It was probably one of the many
reports and files of instructions and clarifications that he received. After I
entered, he placed the pamphlet on the table, turned to look at me and said:
"Good morning, the Member! Look, I read a couple of papers now and they explain
that we should initiate a transfer of…" 
</p>


<p>
"Good morning to you too, Sir." I interrupted him. "Excuse me for bothering
you, but I don’t think it’s relevant anymore." 
</p>


<p>
"Why?" 
</p>


<p>
"Because I came here to file my resignation." 
</p>


<p>
"No way! Just ten minutes ago the other Member of the Organisation
resigned." 
</p>


<p>
"Really?" I asked him. 
</p>


<p>
"Yes. He is now bids the other members farewell." 
</p>


<p>
"Why did he quit?"  
</p>


<p>
"This and that. Said something that he couldn’t take all this stress any
longer, and that he wishes to find a stable job and raise a family. He also
noted that ‘it was fun to serve in the Organisation, but it’s time to move on.’
 "
</p>


<p>
"Okay." 
</p>


<p>
"Yes, but as they say: when it rains it pours. Well, just sign here and I’ll
take care of all the other paperwork."  
</p>


<p>
After I started filling it, I said to him: “about the salary you gave
me...” 
</p>


<p>
“Forget it!” the commander said and continued “during your service in the
Organisation, you've done a great service to your people and your country.
You've earned your pay, even if not honestly, and we thank you that you've
joined our ranks at all in the first place. I just hope that during your civil
life, you'll continue to maintain the spirit of the organisation and its
philosophy.” 
</p>


<p>
“I'll do my best, sir.” I told him with a snap while I signed it. Then I
rose up and we shook hands. I thought a little about what the commander just
said, and then recalled something and sat down. "Look, it may no longer be so
relevant" I said to him "but I’ve been a member of the Organisation for two
years and nobody ever told me what the philosophy of the Organisation was. What
is it, really?" 
</p>


<p>
"Ah… the philosophy? I am surprised that it hadn’t been presented to you
yet. In any case, I’d be happy to give you an answer, the ex-Member of the
Organisation. Now, how should I start? Oh, I know. So here goes: 
</p>


<p>
The philosophy of the Organisation is very simple: our goal is to fight the
Enemy with all our power. It is a holy war of our people against that criminal
nation, and even though the well being of our people and its future are not at
stake, it’s a war of the utmost importance. At least according to what we are
told all the time or that we keep telling each other. 
</p>


<p>
We must sacrifice everything in order to achieve this purpose by our
struggle with the Enemy, even the lives of the members of our people, which for
their interest we are acting at the first place. And we have indeed done it
successfully, and when I look back I realise one thing: we have been doing it
and we are still doing it, despite all the difficulties. True – we had some
difficult times. But they were nothing compared to the almost impossible times,
which we usually have to operate in. 
</p>


<p>
However, since we began fighting the Enemy, we’ve noticed the existence of a
major obstacle that hinders us. Actually it’s not a physical obstacle but a
metaphysical and abstract term, and as such is supposed to be of no
significance. Yet, the popularity of this term made dealing with it an
inevitable fact. My friend, even if we had accepted a very mild interpretation
of it, we would have found ourselves bounded by all sorts of invisible and
impractical rules; we would have been in infinite conflicts and on top of all,
the ambition of our soldiers to fight would have declined enormously. This term
is ‘Morality’.  
</p>


<p>
Therefore, we have decided to accept the philosophical equation ‘Morality =
no morality’." 
</p>


<p>
"Wait a second." I interrupted him, "are you referring to the assumption
that the end justifies the means?" 
</p>


<p>
"Yes! Yes!" said the commander excitedly. " To that precisely. In any case,
accepting this equation places us in a dilemma. The reason for that is that
it’s a complete contradiction of Aristotle’s famous treatise ‘Organum’ which
states, among else, that:  
</p>


<p>
1. A is A. 
</p>


<p>
2. A is not not-A.  
</p>


<p>
Thus, we fully deny the Organum, or at least don’t view it as
indispensable." 
</p>


<p>
"In that case, it is excellent." I said to him. "I read the ‘Organum’ of
Aristotle and although it is a very interesting document in the field of pure
logic, I must say that I also had doubts about it. I’m very glad that the
Organisation rejects it, because in my opinion this fact may facilitate its
activity considerably. For instance, if A could be not-A then because the
members of the Organisation are not the soldiers of the Enemy, they can in-fact
be its soldiers. In my opinion, if you kill each other, you can save a lot of
resources, because the Enemy would be right within your reach. Plus, there will
not be a risk of any casualties since all the men that can possibly get hurt
will belong to the Enemy’s forces. The element of members risking their lives
while infiltrating the Enemy’s lines will not exist either, nor will the
possibility of the Enemy bombarding you." 
</p>


<p>
"Amazing!" cried the commander as he raised from the chair excitedly. "Why
didn’t I think of that before? I’ll make sure your proposal is implemented
right away, and I’ll inform all the other posts and the Organisation’s
headquarters about it. It will be a turn-point in our war against the Enemy. I
thank you, the ex-Member, you have definitely enlightened me." 
</p>


<p>
"The pleasure is all mine. Bye!" I told him while rising from my chair. 
</p>


<p>
"Good bye to you too." He said while barely phasing out of the arrangements
he started in order to implement my proposal. 
</p>


<p>
I left the room and then spent some time at the rest of the post. I parted
from the other members and also found the other member that resigned that day.
I suggested to him that we’ll go back together, and we indeed left the post’s
yard and started walking on the path that lead back to the village. 
</p>


<p>
We started chatting, but it was not five minutes before we heard a sound of
an explosion coming from the post, just as we climbed a hill that overlooked
it. We turned around and watched in terror how the members of the Organisation
kill each other. They split into two opposing sides and fought each other to
the knife with every weapon in the post: guns, grenades, mortars, bombs. They
even blew up the missile storage. 
</p>


<p>
At the end, only one member was left alive, and he stood on the roof of the
post’s ruin and jumped happily while holding his machine-gun over his head.
Then, the commander came out of his room and shot him three times at the
stomach using a pistol. The member fell to the ground, dead.  
</p>


<p>
The commander retrieved his pistol to its sheath, and went back into his
office. We heard him write something on his typewriter, and when he exited he
placed a letter into the mailbox of the post. We assumed it was a report
regarding the successful operation we had just witnessed, which was intended
for the Organisation’s headquarters. After he put the letter in the mailbox, he
turned towards his office while rubbing his hands. Afterwards, he took out his
pistol, turned around and shot a bullet at his head. 
</p>


<p>
After the other ex-Member and I witnessed all this, we pulled our shoulders,
turned around and continued to walk towards the village. 
</p>




<h2 id="terrorist_that_returned_from_the_cold">2. The Terrorist that Returned from the Cold</h2>


<p>
After we arrived at the village, we parted and each one of us returned to
his home. It was approximately 7 am, when I opened the door of my house. No one
was in the living room, so I sat on the coach, took off my shoes and, as I was
used to, placed my feet on the table. Then I remembered that such an action was
not appropriate for someone who lives in the house, so I took my feet off the
table, put my shoes back on, and placed my feet back on the table. 
</p>


<p>
I started to hum a popular tune, like I used to do many times after I
returned home after an exhausting day of work at the Organisation. I must note
that despite my extraordinary intelligence, even I sometimes forget stuff. In
this case I forgot that during the previous times, I returned home only during
the evenings.  
</p>


<p>
A few seconds after I started to sing, I heard some noise from the adjacent
room and then several whispers, which seemed like they were coming from the
direction of the corridor. 
</p>


<p>
Why, the hell, are you making noise now?!" shouted in whisper a feminine
voice, that I recognised as the voice of my younger sister. 
</p>


<p>
"I’m making noise? I was sleeping like a baby. You were the one who made the
noise!" my brother, who is younger than she is, replied to her. 
</p>


<p>
"And you think that I wasn’t sleeping? I don’t know, maybe you talk while
being asleep." 
</p>


<p>
"How do you know that you don’t talk while asleep?" 
</p>


<p>
"Stop it, will you? I made the noise." I shouted towards them in whisper,
"And come to talk here, so you won’t wake up Mom by mistake." 
</p>


<p>
I saw my two younger siblings hesitantly take a look at the sofa from the
opening of the corridor. When they saw it was I, they looked at each other and
then looked back at me. "The Member, why are you back home at such an hour?" my
sister asked in a surprised manner. 
</p>


<p>
"The ex-Member." I corrected her. 
</p>


<p>
"Oh... you quit? That explains it. Well, on a normal condition I would have
congratulated you... if a congratulation is suitable after a resignation. In
any case, I’m too tired to think and I want to go back to bed." And thus they
both returned as they came. 
</p>


<p>
A little later that morning, the whole family (including me) sat down near
the dining table to eat breakfast. "Can someone pass me the butter?" I said a
short time after the meal had begun. 
</p>


<p>
"There you go," my mother told me while she was passing the butter and
putting it on my side. "I understood you resigned from the Organisation." 
</p>


<p>
"Yes." I replied and started to spread the butter on my slice of bread. 
</p>


<p>
"So, what are you planning to do now?" my father asked me. 
</p>


<p>
"I didn’t really give much thought to it. I suppose I’ll go
job-hunting." 
</p>


<p>
"Very good." 
</p>


<p>
After we finished breakfast, I went out of the house and went to the other
villagers to look for a job. The first one I approached was a farmer that lived
several houses away from us. When I reached him, I saw that he was doing some
work in his crop field. "Good morning!" I said to him as I approached him. 
</p>


<p>
"Good morning, the Member of the Organisation", he answered me. 
</p>


<p>
"Actually, it’s the ex-Member, and that’s the reason why I turn to you right
now. You see: I’m looking for a job." 
</p>


<p>
"I am very sorry, I would love to offer you a job, but business have not
been very good lately. Because of the Enemy, of course." 
</p>


<p>
"But Sir, not a single missile that the Enemy shot on this village had ever
hit your land or even fell close to it." 
</p>


<p>
"Nevertheless, the noises that the missiles generated caused the crops not
to grow properly." 
</p>


<p>
"But according to my knowledge in acoustics, the resonance of the seeds is
far higher than the frequency..." 
</p>


<p>
"What difference does it make? In any case, the Enemy is responsible for
everything." 
</p>


<p>
"I see. Have a good day." 
</p>


<p>
"Yes. And in any case, good luck to you in finding a job." 
</p>


<p>
I went to another farmer that lived farther from my home. When I reached him
he was also busy taking care of his field. "Good morning, the Member!" he
greeted me as he noticed me approaching him. 
</p>


<p>
"Good morning" I answered him. "In fact, I quit from the Organisation today
and I came to ask you if you can supply me with a job." 
</p>


<p>
"Unfortunately, the crops in my field, because of the Enemy’s activity, were
not as successful as I hoped for. Therefore, I cannot offer you a job." 
</p>


<p>
"But the last missile which the Enemy fired and which hit your land was 7
years ago." 
</p>


<p>
"Still, the explosives remained in the soil." 
</p>


<p>
"I’m afraid I disagree. The amount of work you put into removing them, not
to mention the erosion during all that time, were supposed to leave only a
minute amount of them in the field, if at all. And besides, there is no
indication that harvest that grows on a field with a small amount of them will
not grow normally." 
</p>


<p>
"Never mind. I still think that there was a long-term effect." 
</p>


<p>
"Okay. I’ll try at someone else. Bye!" 
</p>


<p>
"Good bye to you too." 
</p>


<p>
 And so I went to look for a job at the village’s grocery. I had to stand in
line and when my turn cam the grocer said to me: "Good day to you! We don’t see
you around here often since you joined the Organisation."
</p>


<p>
"Actually, I quit this very day. I was wondering if you have any job for
me." 
</p>


<p>
"Thanks to your wonderful organisation I don’t. Do you remember that, three
weeks ago, the post next to the neighboring village tried to fire a missile at
one of the Enemy’s posts but instead it hit this grocery store by accident? The
missile ruined half of the ceiling and reaped a large hole in the west wall.
The renovations here cost me a fortune, and although I could really use some
help here, I really don’t have the money for a worker’s wage. Maybe some other
time." 
</p>


<p>
"That does it!" I said to myself – I had to react to it. "Sir, ", I said to
him firmly, "I’ve heard some rather weak excuses for a weak financial status
today that I decided to keep silent about, but I’m not ready to simply return
to the agenda after such a poor excuse. 
</p>


<p>
If your business is in bad shape, try to find out what you didn’t do well
and don’t blame someone else. This excuse is non-factual, not to the point,
inconsistent and simply unconvincing. Even a bad politician would not have used
an excuse like that. 
</p>


<p>
Even if you had a job to offer me, I wouldn’t agree to work for you. Have a
good day. Maybe I’ll come back in the evening, hear from you what happened to
you today, and then I’ll be able give you another ten excuses why your
financial state is bad recently. And believe me that all of them will be better
than the one you gave me this instant!" 
</p>


<p>
And so I left the place in anger. A complete lack of reason is always an
irritating thing, not to mention that there was a personal insult involved in
it too. 
</p>


<p>
After I exited I noticed that there are a senior mature officer and a group
of soldiers from the Occupier’s army standing at the end of the street. It
seemed to me like they were asking the residents of the village something, and
then I saw that one farmer pointed straight at me in answer to their questions,
and that they started walking towards me. 
</p>


<p>
The Enemy holds a small part of our country, which is close to its border,
claiming that it needs it to protect his border settlements. The Occupier, on
the other hand, holds half the nation directly, and in the other half rules a
government that it assigned and supervises. Hence, the men of the Occupier’s
army can do within my country as they please. 
</p>


<p>
In any case, after the group of soldiers got close enough to me, the officer
spoke to me and asked: "Are you the ex-Member of the Organisation?" 
</p>


<p>
"In the flesh." I answered. 
</p>


<p>
"In that case, we have a few questions to ask you. The post in which you
served was found today in an almost-destroyed state, and most of its members
were lying around killed. Do you know anything of the post’s destruction?" 
</p>


<p>
"Yes, what do you want to know?" 
</p>


<p>
"For instance, what caused its destruction and the murder of all the members
of the Organisation that served in it. One of our investigators claims that all
evidence point to the fact that they fought each other, yet we thought it was
very inconceivable." 
</p>


<p>
"Actually, it’s very conceivable. It was a constructive outcome of my
efficiency-improving proposal.", and I went on to tell him the rest of the
story. 
</p>


<p>
"But it makes no sense." cried the commander. 
</p>


<p>
"Look," I replied "You must understand that for every logical claim you can
think of there’s an opposite claim which is not logical. The conclusion is that
half of the claims in the world are illogical. You should probably encounter
them every day. 
</p>


<p>
Let me give you an example: principally speaking, is it moral that another
people, say the Enemy, will hold and tyrannize the country of another people,
say the Occupier?" 
</p>


<p>
"Damn no!" said the commander firmly. "If they dared to do so…" 
</p>


<p>
"And yet you yourself are doing it to us, even though you don’t need to do
it for a long time!" 
</p>


<p>
The younger soldiers started to laugh wildly until the commander turned his
angry look towards them and they silenced.  
</p>


<p>
He returned to me, "In any case: it was not the handiwork of the soldiers of
the Enemy’s army?" 
</p>


<p>
"Not as long as they are defined according to Aristotle’s Organum." 
</p>


<p>
"O.K. You are free to go." 
</p>


<p>
"Thank you." 
</p>


<p>
And so they went away. It seemed to me like the soldiers continued to giggle
or were at least smiling to themselves. 
</p>


<p>
I couldn’t find a job that day, but when I returned home that evening I was
told that a I had received a telegram from the leaders of the Supporter, the
country that finances the Organisation. I opened it and started reading it. The
telegram read: 
</p>


<p>
" 
</p>

<p>
Head of the Department of External Security 
</p>

<p>
Headquarters of the Supporter’s Military  
</p>

<p>
The Capital City 
</p>

<p>
State of the Supporter 
</p>


<p>
ATTN: The ex-Member of the Organisation. 
</p>


<p>
RE: Summoning for Questioning and Consultation 
</p>


<p>
Dear ex-Member of the Organisation, 
</p>


<p>
        As a result of your proposal, the Organisation stands in one of the
most severe crises in its entire existence. We would like to summon you to our
meeting, so we can all discuss your proposal and the consequences of its
execution. Although we cannot force you to come, we must mention that it is
your duty as an ex-member of our organisation, according to the Organisation
code, which you took upon yourself to follow.
</p>


<p>
The government of the Supporter will finance your travel, and you will be
able to leave tomorrow morning. We would like to inform you of the following
facts: we cannot assure your safety during this travel. Furthermore, despite
your long service at the Organisation and your constructive proposal, we cannot
say, wholeheartedly or halfheartedly, that we wish to protect your safety.
Likewise, we cannot guarantee that we would not take actions that may harm you,
indirectly or in a direct manner. 
</p>


<p>
We hope to see you here very soon. 
</p>


<p>
        Head of the Department of External Security of the Supporter’s
Military
</p>


<p>
" 
</p>


<p>
After I pondered it during the evening and discussed it with the members of
my family, I finally decided that I do want to go there and meet with them. The
next day, I traveled to the airport by car, and boarded an airplane that flew
there.  
</p>

<h2 id="crying_wolf">3. Crying Wolf.</h2>


<p>
The flight lasted only two hours, and the airplane landed at the airport of
the capital city of the Supporter. A car of the Supporter’s army waited for me
there, and it drove me to the chief headquarters of the military. On the way, I
had the chance to watch the view around the car. 
</p>


<p>
The Supporter Country belongs to the same part of the world as my country,
but because they have an even greater talent of causing the other part of the
world to hate them, I realized that the economical state of things I saw
outside the car was even worse than that of my country. Poverty and hunger were
seen almost everywhere. 
</p>


<p>
After a while, the car stopped in front of the headquarters’ building, and
then they instructed me to exit the car. Two soldiers let me into the building
and led me through several corridors until I arrived at a door that opened to a
room. Inside the room was a long and large-size table, and around it sat senior
officers as well as a number of men wearing civil clothes. At the head of the
table sat a very senior officer with a stern and grave appearance. I assumed it
was the head of the department of external security, who sent me the telegram.
The soldiers sat me in a seat far from him, and then left the room and locked
the door. It was probably a confidential meeting. 
</p>


<p>
After a few seconds, the senior officer started to speak: "I’m glad you
agreed to come here, the ex-Member, because at the moment, we find ourselves in
a very bad situation, that occurred because of you. For years the Organisation
has operated with an extraordinary efficiency and methodology. As a matter of
fact, it was one of our most efficient weapons for venting our anger against
the Enemy. But now, you, you alone, have casted a heavy shadow on its future.
 
</p>


<p>
I’m afraid that unless you find a way to bypass you proposal, then the
results will be catastrophic: not only for the Organisation but for all our
other projects around the world, that are a model of a manner to harmfully and
irrationally unload bad feelings. Moreover, I’m afraid the proposal you
suggested would have some consequences to out internal reign here! 
</p>


<p>
So, the ex-Member, what do you have to say about it?" 
</p>


<p>
"Look, " I addressed him, "I take full responsibility over the proposal I
gave you and its consequences. In my opinion, it is an excellent one, but since
you, for some reason, don’t seem to think so as well, I could help you find a
way to bypass it. The first option is simply to accept Aristotle’s
Organum." 
</p>


<p>
"I’m afraid it is impossible. It contradicts our law-book." 
</p>


<p>
"Can I take a look at your law-book?" 
</p>


<p>
"Certainly." And he ordered one of the other officers to fetch me their
law-book. I opened the book and saw that the first act read as follows:  
</p>

<p>
"1. The assumption that ‘A is A and that A is not not-A’ is not necessarily
true. (or maybe untrue)" 
</p>


<p>
"Why can’t you change the law-book?" I asked him. 
</p>


<p>
"Because then we will have to accept the fact that there’s morality present
in the world. Then, according to the forbidden books No. 34 and 139, which are
evil and unholy writings, but correct in every word, we would be unable to kill
people unless for self-defense. It is hard for me to believe that the Enemy
will independently attack the Organisation’s soldiers, if it knows that they
have no intention to independently attack it." 
</p>


<p>
"I understand. But if I study the writings you mentioned, I believe I can
find there something that will allow such action, because I have an enormous
talent to find faults in a written material. In fact, I contemplated becoming a
lawyer, but I eventually preferred to join the Organisation. It was more
satisfying to do so." 
</p>


<p>
"From the mental aspect?", one of the less prominent officers asked me. 
</p>


<p>
"No, from the physical aspect. I caused more damage this way." 
</p>


<p>
"Let’s get back to our subject:" the Head of the Department of External
Security said, "you cannot inspect the forbidden books, because they are so
dangerous that merely thinking about their content can cause a man to lose his
integrity, much less reading them. I’m afraid that if you read them, they may
affect you, and then you’ll give us a bad advice." 
</p>


<p>
"But Sir, I was never less honest than I am today." 
</p>


<p>
"Even though, I’d rather not." 
</p>


<p>
"In that case," I addressed everybody, "the only option you have left is to
accept my proposal, which in my personal opinion there’s nothing wrong
with!" 
</p>


<p>
A grave silence prevailed in the hall and all the participants seemed like
they were stunned. After a while, the senior officer said: "We’ll seriously
consider your proposal and I believe you will soon know what we have decided to
make of it." 
</p>


<p>
"Okay, I think that I can now return to my country and my village. By the
way, how many forbidden books do you have?" 
</p>


<p>
"Oh,", one of them said to me, " their number grows up geometrically. When I
checked two weeks ago, their number was 2,148,763. A week ago there were
4,278,109 forbidden writings. Now there must be about 8,600,000 ones." 
</p>


<p>
"You are wrong.", I said to him. 
</p>


<p>
"I beg your pardon?" 
</p>


<p>
"There are now exactly 8,517,559 or 8,517,560 forbidden books." 
</p>


<p>
"Why is it so important?" 
</p>


<p>
"Why, it means that meanwhile you have 82,440 or 82,441 extra books you can
read at bedtime if you can’t fall asleep!"

<p>
They game me a ride to the airport where I boarded the first plane that flew
back to my country. I arrived home at nighttime, after the car-ride from the
airport to the village. Since nobody was awake except my father, I immediately
went to sleep. I assumed I could wait until tomorrow to tell my experiences
from the trip. 
</p>


<p>
At eight o’clock, I was awaken by an increasing noise that I managed to
identify as the noise of vehicles, as well as talking and adjustment of
recording and broadcasting equipment. When I went outside I saw that all the
field outside the village was full with broadcasting-vehicles of various media
networks. According to their symbols I recognized that most of them belonged to
companies from the other part of the world. A large number of reporters,
interviewers, camera-men and technicians stood outside the vehicles and
prepared themselves for broadcasting. The whole place was astir. 
</p>


<p>
I pondered what was the reason for that commotion. After a short moment of
thought I rejected the possibility that they came to document the recent birth
of the youngest son of the head of our village, and assumed they were looking
for me. I immediately became fearful that the amplification of the
electromagnetic activity, that was caused by the crowding of the broadcasting
vehicles and radio equipment at the place, will cause another decline in the
crops’ measures. Such thing will make it even harder for me to begin working
again. Thus, I decided to make them leave as soon as possible. 
</p>


<p>
After I returned to the house, got dressed and went out,  I approached one
of the teams which belonged to a prominent channel in one of the countries of
the other part of the world. The reporter there was about to start broadcasting
and another woman from the team helped her arrange her look before she gets
on-air. When I passed by them, the reporter sprang towards me and asked: "Sir,
I assume you come from this village. Have you seen the ex-Member of the
Organisation lately?"
</p>


<p>
"I haven’t seen him since the last time I looked at the mirror.", I
answered. 
</p>


<p>
Then her eyes lighted, the cameraman started taping us and all the crew
members turned to look at me. "So you are the ex-Member?" she asked. 
</p>


<p>
"I wouldn’t have deduced it from what I said." 
</p>


<p>
"I don’t understand.", she said while looking a bit puzzled. 
</p>


<p>
"Over 99.9% of the world population have never seen the ex-Member, much less
since the last time they looked at a mirror. Most of the people that did see
him, have looked at a mirror since then. Moreover, a large part of the persons
that routinely see him, tend to look at the mirror every morning in order to
dress and comb themselves, and probably didn’t see him yet." 
</p>


<p>
Some of the crew members lowered their hand to indicate their desperation
from me, and turned their looks away, but the interviewer still continued to
interrogate me. "Nevertheless, are you the ex-Member of the Organisation?" 
</p>


<p>
"Hmmm... now that I think about it: yes." 
</p>


<p>
Immediately, all the crew members whispered my name to one another and
concentrated around me. The rumour quickly passed on to other crews and very
quickly a large crowd of reporters, cameraman, recorders and broadcasters
gathered in a large semicircle around me. 
</p>


<p>
They immediately started to ask me questions at a dazzling rate: 
</p>

<p>
"The ex-Member, do you think the Organisation will accept your
proposal?" 
</p>

<p>
"The ex-Member, why did you decide to go to the State of the
Supporter?" 
</p>

<p>
"The ex-Member, what will become of the Organisation?" 
</p>

<p>
"The ex-Member, what do you think about the situation that prevails in this
region?" 
</p>


<p>
I raised my hand to mute them, and after a few minutes they all silenced.
"I’m sorry that you had to travel until here," I said, "but I’m not ready to
answer your questions at the moment." 
</p>


<p>
Some of them seemed a bit overwhelmed from the answer. "Wait a second,",
asked a young reporter, "will you be willing to answer some questions in the
future." 
</p>


<p>
"There is a possibility that I will." I answered him. 
</p>


<p>
"Are you conditioning it in something?" he continued to ask. 
</p>


<p>
"Yes." 
</p>


<p>
Silence prevailed. "Wait, wait, wait, " another journalist said, "are you
implying that you want money for an interview?" 
</p>


<p>
"Yes! That’s exactly what I meant." 
</p>


<p>
"Ahh-ha." The journalists began to disperse and each one returned to his
broadcasting vehicle and I saw that they try to contact their news
corporations’. Eventually they all left the place, what created a serious
traffic jam at the way out of the village for a long time. 
</p>


<p>
I went back home and ate breakfast. I spent the morning searching for a job
in the vicinity of my home, and again was not able to find anything. When I
returned home for lunch, my young sister sat in the living room and prepared
her homework. "The ex-Member,  I prepared a list of broadcasting networks that
propose to pay you for an interview. It is place over there, on the table." She
said all of a sudden, and then returned to prepare her home exercises.
</p>


<p>
I looked at the list, picked up the telephone and dialed the number that was
written beside the first media corporation that called me. I was answered after
a few seconds: 
</p>


<p>
"Hello, I am the ex-Member of the Organisation; you contacted me so I will
give you an interview. I want some details about the payment you are offering
me." 
</p>

<p>
"I see." 
</p>

<p>
"Yes." 
</p>

<p>
"Okay, that sounds rather nice, I’ll call you later and tell you what I
decided about it. Good bye." 
</p>


<p>
I hanged up the phone and called the next network on the list. 
</p>

<p>
"Hello, this is the ex-Member of the Organisation, you contacted me so I’ll
give you an interview, and I’d like to inquire about the size of your
offer." 
</p>

<p>
"Ahha." 
</p>

<p>
"O.K. Maybe you’d like to know that the other company offered me more
money." 
</p>

<p>
"Yes. Roughly this amount." 
</p>


<p>
A few seconds elapsed... 
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you have a better offer." 
</p>

<p>
"How much?" 
</p>

<p>
"Hmmm. Doesn’t sound bad. I’ll call you later to let you know of my
decision." 
</p>

<p>
I called the third company and again received a better offer. Then I called
the first company again and told them about the proposal of the third company.
As I expected, they gave me an even better offer. 
</p>


<p>
And so I went on, for a day and a half, with short discussions with an
increasing number of large media networks, and I kept receiving increasing
offers of payment for an exclusive interview. In my opinion, it was very
sincere of me to tell every one of the companies about the offers I received
from the others, but for some reason, they didn’t sound too enthusiastic when
they realized I was doing it on a regular basis.  
</p>


<p>
"Sir, your offer sounds very tempting. In fact, it’s almost as tempting as
another offer, which I received a couple of hours ago. Wait a second, are you
saying that you have a better offer? Really? Yes, it does sound better. Just
give me half-an-hour to consider it. Yes. Yes. Goodbye to you too." 
</p>


<p>
And a few minutes later: "Hello Madam! I’m glad that I was finely able to
reach you. You won’t believe it but I was this close to accepting your offer
when the telephone rang, and I was offered an even better one. I’m sorry, but
it’s really nothing personal. Really? Let’s see, in comparison to the other
offer it’s..." 
</p>


<p>
Anyway, I eventually got tired of this multi-sided negotiation, and decided
to take the most attractive offer so far. This offer included a sum of money
that was considered very large even in terms of the other part of the world.
Moreover, it included a flight to one of the big cities there, and an
accommodation at a five star hotel, at the expense of the media company of
course. There I had to be interviewed at an evening show of one of the most
famous hosts in the other part of this world. This was a host which I was
particularly fond of. The main reason for that was that I had never seen any of
her shows and so did not change my initial opinion. 
</p>


<p>
So it happened that I had to leave my country for the second time that week.
After I packed my belongings, and said goodbye to my family and my neighbours,
I went to the airport in a car, which was also prepared and financed by the
media company. At the airport I boarded a plane that flew towards the city in
which the interview was about to take place. 
</p>

<h2 id="a_star_is_born_maybe">5. A Star is Born. Maybe.</h2>

<p>
The flight that lasted 11 hours exhausted me completely and I was glad that
they took me straight to the hotel, where I fell asleep right after lying on
the bed. After I woke up at a late hour of the morning, I ordered breakfast,
and then decided to go on a half tour-half shopping spree in the city. Even
though I was supposed to get most of the money only after the interview, I had
a good amount of money that was given to me in advance. The show in which I had
to be interviewed, was scheduled for that night, and I understood that I had
very little time for touring and shopping. 
</p>


<p>
The tour of the city was very interesting, and I was able to see wealth and
luxury that I never had a chance to see. At least not since the time I was a
little boy, before my country was torn by guerrilla organisations such as the
Organisation. The luxury of the hotel was also way beyond what I was used to in
my house, but I was sure that in the other part of the world, most people could
not afford themselves such luxury in their houses either. 
</p>


<p>
The time passed very quickly and it was time for the interview. Two hours
before it was held, they drove me in a limousine to the company's studios'
building, where the show was shot live. I was brought to the makeup and
dressing room where they feat me clothes, applied makeup to my face, and
prepared me for the show. 
</p>


<p>
In the middle of the makeup, the makeup person asked me: "Do you feel like
you're ready for the interview?" 
</p>


<p>
"I think so." I told her. 
</p>


<p>
"Are you calm and everything?" 
</p>


<p>
"Yes. Do I have any reason to be nervous?" 
</p>


<p>
"Maybe. Did you have the chance to see one of the shows of this
interviewer?" 
</p>


<p>
"No. Why?" 
</p>


<p>
"She's just a tough interviewer and is very candid with her interviewees. If
there is an embarrassing or a controversial issue in their background, she will
not hesitate to ask questions about it. Many people don't feel comfortable with
her. 
</p>


<p>
Maybe you want to see a recording of one of the shows to prepare
yourself?" 
</p>


<p>
"No, that's O.K. I love surprises. In fact, I noticed that I respond better
after something unexpected happened than after something that I knew was
already going to happen." 
</p>


<p>
"As you wish. By the way, how much did you get for the interview?
Really?!" 
</p>


<p>
After they finished dressing me and making me up, there was still some time
left until the beginning of the show, and I spent it in the studios. I was
offered to meet the interviewer before the interview, but preferred not to
(being spontaneous requires a little planning). Then the show started, yet I
wasn't the first person to be interviewed there (rating considerations). The
interviewer first interviewed two motion picture actors who came out with a new
film, a psychologist who published his first book, and a physicist who recently
publicised a finding that he discovered along with his colleagues. I was
supposed to enter after the interview with the physicist was finished, the
physicist being present at my interview. 
</p>


<p>
"So, " the interviewer asked the physicist towards the end of the personal
interview with him, "what would be the implications of the discovery on the
industry?" 
</p>


<p>
And he answered: "Well, the material is useful in many areas of the
industry, but because until now its price was relatively high, companies used
cheaper alternative materials instead of it. Our discovery, which lowers the
price of its manufacture, will bring that factories will be able to use it
instead of the alternative materials and thus improve the quality of their
products.  
</p>


<p>
My labs are in progressive stages of writing the patent on the improved
manufacturing process, and I hope my colleagues and I will receive a generous
sum of money from the royalties on the patent." 
</p>


<p>
"I hope it will be so, because you probably invested a lot of works in its
development." 
</p>


<p>
"Yes. Definitely." 
</p>


<p>
"That's all for now, Doctor. I ask you to stay here in the studio to receive
our next guest, which many of the viewers waited to see the interview with him
impatiently. This is a man which is so logical that it's practically scary. A
man, whose actions have implications on the whole world. A media hero, that a
week ago no one knew who he was. Is he a hero for a moment, or a new star was
born in the skies of the world's politics? 
</p>


<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the ex-Member of the
Organisation!!" 
</p>


<p>
This was my queue to come in, and so I entered the studio to the tempered
claps of the audience that sat there. I went in the direction of the
interviewer, greeted the people who were present, and shook her hand and the
hand of the physicist. Right after that, I sat down in one of the guest's
chairs that were vacant next to the physicists. And then the interview
began. 
</p>


<p>
The interviewer waited for the end of the hand-clapping, while moving here
gaze from the audience in the studio to the physicist and me. After there was
silence, she looked towards me and said: "The ex-Member, I must say we are very
happy to have you here on our show. Tell me: how do you feel here, in the other
part of the world?" 
</p>


<p>
"Excellent. The conditions are much more comfortable than what I'm usually
used to." I answered. 
</p>


<p>
"Very well. " She said, "Please tell us a bit about your service in the
Organisation? How did you feel back then?" 
</p>


<p>
"Oh, it was definitely an illustrative service. However, there was one thing
which bothered both me and my late comrades: they kept lecturing to us how bad
the Enemy was and why we must fight it. I think half of our training time was
wasted on such lectures. We knew the Enemy was bad, and that was the reason we
joined the Organisation at the first place! 
</p>


<p>
In my opinion, it was completely unnecessary. Perhaps they thought that
without those brain-washes we would have reached the conclusion that there is
no rational behind the activity against the Enemy. Most of us reached this
conclusion a few months, if not less, after we joined the Organisation and we
still kept fighting. So they didn't have a reason to go to this length and just
bother us." 
</p>


<p>
"Yet, you are content with your retirement from the Organisation and with
your interesting suggestion for improving the efficiency of its actions?" 
</p>


<p>
"Of course." 
</p>


<p>
"Tell me: do you, personally, hate the Enemy?" 
</p>


<p>
"Sure. That's why I suggested my suggestion, so the Organisation can fight
it better." 
</p>


<p>
There was a short pause. "Can you tell us, following your visit to the land
of the Supporter, how they eventually decided to handle it?", she
continued. 
</p>


<p>
"Actually, I could tell you. We reached the conclusion that my suggestion
corresponds to the philosophy of the Supporter and of the Organisation, and it
will probably be implemented to a greater extent in the Organisation and in
other establishments of the Supporter worldwide." 
</p>


<p>
"Speaking of the philosophy, according to many people who live here, in the
other part of the world, both the philosophy and the actions of the
Organisation are completely irrational." 
</p>


<p>
"The Organisation thought that such a thing might happen, and therefore he
printed his philosophy on a note." 
</p>


<p>
"I'm sorry, but I don't understand how it contributes to its validation.
Everyone can write the biggest nonsense on a note, and yet it will remain
illogical and subjective to whoever said it." 
</p>


<p>
"But this note was printed in eight billion copies, and thus there's plenty
of it for every man alive, what makes it objective for all practical reasons.
You can receive it from the Organisation for free, by enclosing mail payment
only. Likewise, you can find it on the Internet in the following URL: 
</p>

<p>
http://www.the-organisation.org/reference/anti-something/Aristotle/Organum/ 
</p>

<p>
our_philosophy.html." 
</p>


<p>
The interviewer seemed shocked for a moment. Some media experts would claim
it was unprofessional, but in my opinion, it was pretty much in place. "Indeed
a strong argument, and I'm sure many of the viewers would take your suggestion,
and will check the philosophy of the Organisation themselves. Whether they will
accept it - that it is a different question." 
</p>


<p>
"Well, the objectivity of a certain thing is not dependent on people
accepting it." 
</p>


<p>
"Of course. Let me move on to the next question, which interests me and
probably many other people very much. It is known that both the Enemy and the
Occupier invaded your country, after actions of terrorist organisations such as
the Organisation caused it to lose stability. Both countries had one share or
another in its destruction. Today, the Occupier occupies a large part of your
country directly, and controls most of the other part with a puppet government.
The Enemy, on the other hand, occupies only a small part of your country which
is close to its border, for security reasons, and the condition of the people
who live there, is as far as I know, not so bad. Why, if so, the residents of
your country act mostly against the Enemy and not against the Occupier?" 
</p>


<p>
"An excellent question, Madame. There is, probably, some activity against
the Occupier's army, but it is much limited and doesn't receive as much media
coverage. Furthermore, it is a lot easier to fight the enemy, because the
Organisation receives the support of the Supporter and the acceptance of the
Occupier. Moreover, the Enemy's country, as opposed to the Occupier's country,
is a free country, and therefore is committed to behave in a moral manner, even
towards the members of the Organisation, that are, out of self-definition,
immoral. 
</p>


<p>
If those reasons are not enough, then since the beginning of the Occupier's
occupation, there have been peace in our country, which was disturbed only by
the activity in the southern border. The civilians are happy that there's peace
at last, and so they don't really mind that the country is under foreign
occupation. 
</p>


<p>
In my opinion, even if we had all the reasons to fight the Occupier, then
like the man who looks under the light of a street-light for a coin he lost in
the dark, we would have still preferred to fight the Enemy. It's much more
convenient, and still satisfying." 
</p>


<p>
"From what I understood from what you said," The physicist said "the war
against the Enemy doesn't bring your country much good, and it would have been
better if you did not fight it at all." 
</p>


<p>
"Definitely Not!" I replied to him vigorously "The very fact that it would
have been better to fight the Occupier, doesn't mean that fighting the Enemy,
even tough it isn't beneficial for us in the long run, or even the short run,
is useless." 
</p>


<p>
"O.K., we could say you cleared that point." The interviewer said and
continued, "Several factors in the Enemy's country suggest that the Enemy's
army will retreat from the security-zone that he possesses at the moment in the
south of your country, and will try to protect his civilians only from within
his sovereign territory. This action might stop the fighting between him and
the Organisation, because the Organisation reasons the continuation of the
fighting in that it does it to liberate that territory.  
</p>


<p>
Yet, the Supporter's country despises the Enemy, not because he hurt your
people or holds part of your country, but out of ideological motives.
Therefore, its interest is that the fighting against the Enemy will not be
stopped at all. Moreover, even for the Occupier, the withdrawal from that
territory will not change anything, and he'll want the fighting to go on. 
</p>


<p>
Thus, assuming the Enemy withdrew from that limited territory he's
controlling at the moment, do you think the Organisation would continue its
activity against the Enemy?" 
</p>


<p>
Undoubtedly, this was also a very good question. I thought about it a little
and replied: "Look, it's not a small dilemma. On the one hand, it would be more
difficult for them to get support for the actions from the civilians, unless
they will manipulate the desire for revenge on the Enemy's past crimes. Still,
both the Supporter and the Occupier, which now sanctions the aggressive
activity of the Organisation, will want the Organisation to keep on fighting
out of their own motives. 
</p>


<p>
As you may well remember, I met with those who are responsible on the
Organisation's activity in the Supporter's government and I realised that
except for the fact that they reject Aristotle's Organum, they are very
reasonable people. Therefore, I estimate that in such a case, they will take
the reasonable decision. For people who reject the Organum, of course." 
</p>


<p>
"That is, will continue to fight the Enemy?", the physicist asked. 
</p>


<p>
"Or vise versa. When the Organum is rejected, it's hard to know." 
</p>


<p>
"I'd like to ask the ex-Member a question.", the physicist said. 
</p>


<p>
"Please do." The interviewer said to him. 
</p>


<p>
"Some of the actions of the Organisation were followed by bombardments of
the air force of the Enemy's military, which were, at times, even very massive.
Those bombardments sometimes caused civilians of your people to get hurt. The
Organisation knew in advance that such bombardments could come as response to
its activity, and yet didn't stop it. In your opinion, can one say that the
Organisation is responsible in killing its own people?" 
</p>


<p>
"No!" I replied to him, "It is absurd to believe that if someone performed
an action with an expected cause, then he's guilty of the cause. Thus, for
instance, as opposed to common belief, Hitler is not responsible for breaking
World War II. All he wanted was for people to hear his command to invade
Poland! 
</p>


<p>
Furthermore, a man who positioned a gun at the forehead of another man and
shot him, is not responsible for killing him. All he wanted was that the bullet
will be emitted from the barrel, or even just for the trigger to be set
backwards!" 
</p>


<p>
"Speaking about bombardments," The interviewer said, "many criticisms were
directed at the Enemy for hurting the civilians among you, although they are
only trying to hurt the Organisation's soldiers. As an objective viewer, do you
think those criticisms are justified?" 
</p>


<p>
"What do you mean?" I asked, "I have always been completely objective." 
</p>


<p>
"But you served in the Organisation!" The physicist burst, "The Organisation
tries to hurt the soldiers or even the civilians of the Enemy, who are
innocent. In my opinion, you were a criminal." 
</p>


<p>
"You are right," I told him, " But I was a criminal in an objective
manner." 
</p>


<p>
"Let's get back to the question. Are the accusations against the Enemy's
Military justified?" The interviewer addressed me again. 
</p>


<p>
"Absolutely." I answered, "Even if they were completely accurate, they would
have hurt the Organisation's soldiers and kill them." 
</p>


<p>
"But we just agreed they were criminals!" The physicist said in half
bewilderment, half anger. 
</p>


<p>
"And wait - is it justified to kill a criminal? Is the stealer from a thief
exempt?" 
</p>


<p>
"So, you are a pacifist?" 
</p>


<p>
"No! After all I served in the Organisation." 
</p>


<p>
"Very well." Said the interviewer to both of us, "In my opinion, we, more or
less, saturated the political aspect of this conversation. The ex-Member, would
you allow me to ask you a couple of personal questions now?" 
</p>


<p>
"Wait a second, do you think the questions so far weren't personal?" 
</p>


<p>
The interviewer stopped for a moment and moved her hands, "No. What kind of
questions do you consider as personal?" 
</p>


<p>
"I consider all questions as personal except for the questions 'Is question
X a personal question?' and 'Is question Y not a personal question?'. You see,
I don't want to create a private case of the Russell Paradox." 
</p>


<p>
"Well, so let's proceed with your permission with some further personal
questions." 
</p>


<p>
"Please do." 
</p>


<p>
"How do you describe your outlook on the world?" 
</p>


<p>
"Well. In my opinion, everything in the world ranges from the very stupid to
the completely illogical." 
</p>


<p>
"That's a bold statement." 
</p>


<p>
"No it's not! It's a stupid and irrational statement." 
</p>


<p>
"Oh yes, it makes sense." 
</p>


<p>
"If you say so. In my opinion, it's just stupid." 
</p>


<p>
"Speaking of lack of logic: many told me that they found your behaviour very
... ahem ... unusual and your logic also seems to them to be very insane." 
</p>


<p>
"I agree with them." I replied to her. "Had I not been already insane, I
would have long ago driven myself mad." 
</p>


<p>
"Do you have any plans for the future?" 
</p>


<p>
"Absolutely. I intend to publish a book with my memoirs from the last
period. In my opinion, it will be one of the most revolutionary books since
Aristotle's Organum, and I hope it will help lower the prestige of the last
treatise. I noticed that the contents of this treatise receives an almost full
consensus, even in the wide public, and this is despite the fact that most
people had never read it. Doubtless, this treatise had an enormous conscious
and subconscious effect since it was written - unjustifiably in my opinion -
and I hope my book will help decrease it in considerably." 
</p>


<p>
"Tell me, the ex-Member, do you have any hobbies? What do you do in your
spare time?" 
</p>


<p>
"Among the activities I do in my spare time I can list the following:
finding closer and closer solutions to a set of differential equations from the
second degree. I also deal in trying to understand the sentences I said in the
past. Except for that, I planned a political simulator that forecast the two
World Wars after I entered all the relevant data until the year 1000 AD." 
</p>


<p>
"Do you have a computer at home?" 
</p>


<p>
"Oh no. At present the program is written on a paper. Don't ask how much
time it took me to fully debug it. But it was great fun!" 
</p>


<p>
"Is that all?" 
</p>


<p>
"No... there's another thing. Let me just remember what it is. I also
like... come on... "  
</p>


<p>
"To try to disprove the Theory of Relativity?" suggested the
interviewer. 
</p>


<p>
"To plan how to take over the world by investments in the stock market?"
said the physicist. 
</p>


<p>
"Ahh... I like to play on a guitar!" 
</p>


<p>
A few laughs were heard from the direction of the audience while the
interviewer and the physicist silenced for a few seconds. "Interesting habit."
Said the Interviewer. 
</p>


<p>
"I would have never guessed you dealt with it." The physicist added. 
</p>


<p>
"Why?" I asked with wonder, "As far as I know, many people play the
guitar." 
</p>


<p>
"You know:", The physicist said, "in my opinion since you left the
Organisation you acted without thinking a lot before you did things. I would
define your behaviour as deriving from spontaneousness and fickle-mindedness
that border rashness. Do you also think so?" 
</p>


<p>
"Of course!" I answered him, "Except for arrogance, rashness is my only
defect!" 
</p>


<p>
"Gentlemen, I would have been glad to continue this interview and I'm sure
the viewers would have wanted to learn more about the exciting life of the
ex-Member. However, I am being told that our program has reached its end.", The
Interviewer said after I finished my sentence. "Dear Doctor and the ex-Member
of the Organisation, I thank you for getting interviewed here with me. As for
you, the viewers in the homes and in the studio, I hope you enjoyed the
interviews that were in the show. We wish you a good evening and a pleasant
continuation of viewing." 
</p>


<p>
And then came the signal that ended the show, and the ending music was
broadcast around the studio. The audience in the studio began to clap its
hands, while the interviewer, the physicist and I went on to sit in the studio
for a few minutes. Then we went out backstage. 
</p>


<p>
"Madame, I think it was an excellent interview!" I said to the interviewer
while the three of us were standing backstage, along with the guests that got
interviewed before, and discussed the program that was just broadcast. "The
questions were really top of the line, and I believe that even for me it was a
challenge to answer them. Doctor, you had your share of brilliant ideas
too." 
</p>


<p>
"Thank you." The Doctor said. 
</p>


<p>
"Likewise." Added the interviewer and said: "Your answers were also very ...
unusual." 
</p>


<p>
"Although this description cannot testify on their quality, I take it as a
compliment." 
</p>


<p>
Then one of the production people approached her and gave her several video
cassettes. "Here", she addressed me as she gave me one of the cassettes. "This
is a taping of the show which we prepared for the guests." 
</p>


<p>
"Well, I don't have a VCR at home right now, but thank you anyway." I
thanked her and started to walk in order to get out of the studio. But then I
stopped for a moment and turned to her: "By the way," I said, "I still haven't
figured out why the questions that you asked me during the first part of the
interview were more personal than the questions you asked me at the second
one." 
</p>




<h2 id="to_the_lions_den">6. To the Lion's Den.</h2>


<p>
The Limousine drove me back to the hotel and there I went to sleep, after
barely taking off my clothes. I slept a lot that night. When I woke up in the
morning it was already Ten O'clock, and I decided to order a small breakfast to
my room. The flight back home was only due in the evening, so I had plenty of
time; usually I would have used the opportunity to continue my tour of the
metropolis, but the interview and the preparations for it exhausted me
physically and mentally. 
</p>


<p>
Therefore I decided to stay in my room and watch television. I was happy for
the chance to see so many series at once, something that was not usually
possible in the village. When I saw sitcoms I decided that I'll keep guessing
what the next punch-line would be. All in all I was successful in 23.3 percent
of the cases. Not bad for a beginner. 
</p>


<p>
Eventually I got tired of watching television and I went down to the hotel's
lobby. While I sat there I thought about the book I was going to write about
everything that happened to me. I started planning the style in which I would
write it, how I'll negotiate with the publisher, how much money should I demand
as an initial offer, and what circulation could it have. But then I realized
something: despite the fact that I am one of the men who had the most enormous
effect on worldwide politics in the last couple of years, if not in the last
couple of decades, it wouldn't be probable that my book would be very
successful. First, I wouldn't be able to describe many events in it, because
the majority of the readers would not want me to describe the period in which I
served in the Organisation. Moreover, I came to a realisation that there is
another aspect of the affair which I did not cover yet. 
</p>


<p>
Thus I reached the conclusion that in order for the book to succeed, I must
visit the Enemy's country. I realised that I also have a patriotic motive to do
this, because I could integrate the collection of important intelligence
information about the Enemy,  into the visit. So, I rose from my seat, went out
of the hotel, ordered a cab and went to the embassy of the Enemy.
</p>


<p>
I entered the embassy and the way embassies are I had to stand in line in
order to talk with the clerk. After I waited in line for about half an hour, I
managed to speak with her at last, and declared my desire to visit the Enemy's
country. She gave me a form and asked me to fill in my details. I took the
form, took out a pen from the pocket of my shirt and started to fill the form.
In my opinion, it was a very inefficient form and practically unnecessary.
Judge for yourself: 
</p>


<p>
"Private Name:", in this field I wrote: "The ex-Member of the
Organisation". 
</p>

<p>
"Family Name:", in this field I wrote: "The family of the ex-Member of the
Organisation". 
</p>

<p>
"Address: Home of the family of the ex-Member of the Organisation; The
Village; The Country". 
</p>

<p>
"Sex [also species]: Human (Homo Sapiens)." It was hard for me to believe
that there is at the moment another species of organisms that can fill the
form, but I let it slide. 
</p>

<p>
"Citizenship: The Country." I assumed that for diplomatic purposes it
existed. 
</p>

<p>
"Marital Status [= Familiar Status] : son, brother, grandson, nephew, uncle,
cousin, brother-in-law." I assumed they were not interested in a farther
relation. 
</p>

<p>
"Purpose of the visit:", I decided to be honest with them, so they won't
cause me trouble so I wrote "hostile espionage" in this field. 
</p>

<p>
"Criminal record:", since all my actions as a member of the Organisation
were performed on a national background I wrote: "None" in this field. 
</p>

<p>
"Duration of stay:", it was hard for me to estimate it so I wrote:
"Undefined, unknown, inaccessible and/or cannot be approximated or
extrapolated." 
</p>


<p>
After I finished filling the form, I waited in line for another clerk. When
my turn arrived I gave her my form along with my passport and told her I wish
to visit her country. The clerk looked at the form and then distorted her face
as a sign of perplexity. "Sir, I'm afraid this form is not filled well." She
told me. 
</p>


<p>
"Really?" I answered, "Why not?" 
</p>


<p>
"For instance under 'Sex' you were supposed to write if you're a male or a
female." 
</p>


<p>
"And I thought it meant a biological species. The name of this field mislead
me. In my opinion, you should change it to 'sexual status' or 'sexual
tendency'." 
</p>


<p>
"Ahah. I'm afraid some people will interpret those terms in a completely
different way." 
</p>


<p>
"In that case, what do you think of 'gender'?" 
</p>


<p>
"A correct but infrequent term. I'll forward your suggestion to the higher
levels." 
</p>


<p>
"I thank you in advance, on my behalf and the behalf of the embassy's
customers that will come after me." 
</p>


<p>
"Yes, and besides in 'Marital Status' you were supposed to fill in if you're
single or married with or without children and so on." 
</p>


<p>
"Oh, if I had been married I would have also written there that I'm a
husband, son-in-law, brother-in-law and so forth while if I had had children I
would have also put 'father'." 
</p>


<p>
"O.K., but it seems to me that there is a more serious problem. You are the
citizen of the Country, which is in a state of war with us; you were a member
of the Organisation and took a part in terrorist activity that was aimed
against us, and if that's not enough you write that the purpose of your visit
is 'hostile espionage'. I don't think we can let you in our country that
way." 
</p>


<p>
"In my opinion, you should have an interest to let me in now. After all, I
am the ex-Member of the Organisation, a person with a central role and a
long-term effect on politics. If I had stood in the head of your security
institutions, I would have been very happy if I were able to interview myself,
and I can't see a better chance to do that than if I visit your country, where
you'll have a legal privilege to do so. Besides that, I must indicate that my
espionage methods are too sophisticated for me to have to take illegal
espionage actions, such as obtaining secret documents, or listening to
conferences behind closed doors." 
</p>


<p>
"I.e.: you only intend to do things that a regular tourist is freely allowed
to do?" 
</p>


<p>
"Absolutely." 
</p>


<p>
"Ah hah." The clerk said and thought for a moment. "Know what? I'll pass on
your request to the higher levels. In case you get an approval to enter the
Enemy's country, I'll let you know about it by phone, as long you stay in this
country." 
</p>


<p>
"I would very much like to visit your country and therefore I'm willing to
wait here, even a couple of days." 
</p>


<p>
"All right. Goodbye." 
</p>


<p>
"Goodbye to you too and thanks for your help." 
</p>


<p>
I went back to the hotel, and extended my stay (from my own money this time)
- it was hard to know how long they will consider if to let me in the Enemy's
country. I decided to continue my tour of the city, and returned to the hotel
only in the evening. After I entered, I was informed at the reception that I
got a message from the Enemy's embassy which informed me that I was allowed to
enter the Enemy's country. 
</p>


<p>
So I went the other day's morning to the Embassy and filled all the other
necessary forms. After the visit to the Embassy, I managed to order one of the
last tickets to a flight that left that very evening. I went after a few hours
to the airport, where after longer than usual arrangements (due to the special
permit I was given), I boarded an airplane that flew directly to the Enemy's
country. 
</p>

<h2 id="interviewing_with_the_enemy">7. Interviewing with the Enemy</h2>

<p>
After I landed in the airport I ordered a hotel in one of the main cities in
the Enemy's country and took a cab that went there. On the way I was able to
see the view around, and despite the closeness to my country, it was much
different from what was known to me. I'm not talking about the climate - the
country was simply more developed. The economy of the Enemy's country is far
from being perfect, but it is still considered to be one of the countries of
the other part of the world. 
</p>


<p>
After I rose up in the morning and started to tour it (with a direct
intention to gather intelligence information) I noticed that the atmosphere
there was not much different from what I remembered in my country. However, it
bothered me that all the people I asked accepted Aristotle's Organum without a
doubt. I assumed that that what would happen, but I hope the publication of my
book will change this fact even there. 
</p>


<p>
It was in the middle of that day when a black car stopped next to me and a
man that wore sun-glasses cam out from the seat next to the driver's seats. He
said to me in a thick voice: "The ex-Member of the Organisation, in order to
prevent unpleasantness, please enter and sit at the back seat of the car." 
</p>


<p>
"Sir," I replied, "I have a natural tendency to create unpleasantness, but I
am willing to suppress it for the while and thus I'll cooperate." I said that
and entered the car through the back door which was already open. I saw that
outside the car, the man that wore the sun-glasses, closed the back door and
entered the car himself. The car drove away, and after a short drive stopped in
front of a fortified building.  
</p>


<p>
I was instructed to get out of the car and after I exited from it, the
guards in the entrance to the building let me and the man from the front in. He
led me in a couple of hallways until we reached a door. The door opened into a
window-less room, inside which there was a desk. On one of its side set a man,
that I assumed was the investigator, and in its other side was a vacant chair.
The man that escorted me, told me to sit there, and then closed the door in
which we entered and sat down at a chair on the side. 
</p>


<p>
The investigator addressed me and said: "Are you the ex-Member of the
Organisation?" 
</p>


<p>
"Yes, sir.", I answered him. 
</p>


<p>
"We would like to ask you a few questions regarding the Organisation and we
hope, for your and our sake, that you will cooperate with us." 
</p>


<p>
"I'll do the best I can. Normally, I tend not to cooperate even with myself.
That way, if I decide to do a foolish thing - I don't get hurt and can't be
blamed for causing it either." 
</p>


<p>
"O.K.. I apologise that we brought you here so urgently, but you must
remember that if it wasn't for this interview, you wouldn't be able to visit
here, and we wanted to interview you before you start touring our country and
we'll lose track of you." 
</p>


<p>
"Sir, the only person who ever lost track of me is myself." 
</p>


<p>
"I understand, but since you're already here I'll begin the interview
anyway. First question: why did you resign from the Organisation?" 
</p>


<p>
"Because I wanted to resign from it." 
</p>


<p>
"And why did you wanted to resign from the Organisation?" 
</p>


<p>
"So I'll have a good excuse if somebody asks me why I resigned from
it." 
</p>


<p>
The investigator seemed a bit confused but went on to investigate me: "O.K.
Please describe to us in general your service in the Organisation." 
</p>


<p>
"Generally, I served in the Organisation by following my commander's orders
in our trial to kill as many soldiers from your army as possible." 
</p>


<p>
"Would you be a little more specific?" 
</p>


<p>
"But you asked me to describe the service in general." 
</p>


<p>
"All right. Can you describe it in a more detailed way?" 
</p>


<p>
"Of course. I remember what happened in a rather detailed manner. I started
to serve in November 5, 1996 at 8:03 exactly. For five minutes I waited outside
the registration room and then I was let in. The interviewer asked me for my
name and I answered him. Then he asked me for my address, my telephone number,
my marital status... " 
</p>


<p>
The investigator interrupted me: "O.K.! O.K.! Forget it. Describe the
motivation of the members of the Organisation to me." 
</p>


<p>
"Look, I only know for certain what was the motivation of my comrades from
the post, may they rest in peace, but because they are not longer among the
living, I don't think it would be very helpful to you." 
</p>


<p>
"And what about those who serve in other posts?" 
</p>


<p>
"It changes from post to post. The mutual relationship between the commander
of the post to the members of the Organisation that are under his command can
very much affect the willingness of the members to fight the Enemy." 
</p>


<p>
"How?" 
</p>


<p>
"If the relationship between them is good, they are more willing to do
so." 
</p>


<p>
"Ah hah. Can you tell me what was the attitude of your comrades toward the
Enemy, the Supporter or the Occupier?" 
</p>


<p>
"Yes. As far as I remember we hated the Enemy and despised the Occupier,
even though we acknowledged the fact that he allows us a freedom of action
against the Enemy." 
</p>


<p>
"We already know that!" 
</p>


<p>
"Excellent! Now you have a more solid basis to assume that." 
</p>


<p>
"Very well. Tell me - what weaponry and equipment and in what quantity did
you have in the post?" 
</p>


<p>
"All the weapons and equipment that we had were destroyed because of the
tragic battle that occurred there between the men of the post to
themselves." 
</p>


<p>
"Can you tell me anything about the equipment and the weaponry that is kept
by other posts?" 
</p>


<p>
"No. I wasn't interested in what went on in other posts, because I was too
concerned with the affairs of my own post. You see, I never thought I'll ever
have to give intelligence information for the other side." 
</p>


<p>
"I see. How would you rate the fighting ability and the level of the
fighters who served with you in the post?" 
</p>


<p>
"In my appreciation, the fighting ability of my comrades ranged between an
excellent fighting ability to a very low fighting ability, with a tendency to
concentrate in either of the two extremes, or in any level between them." 
</p>


<p>
"Do you have any other information that can aid us in our struggle against
the Organisation?" 
</p>


<p>
"Of course, I can explain Newton's Second Law of Motion to you. It's a very
useful law and is almost compulsory for effective military warfare." 
</p>


<p>
"The men of our military know and understand Newton's Second Law of Motion
very well, and I'm sure they use it a lot for many purposes in the routine
management of the military." 
</p>


<p>
"You see: even you agree that it's useful! But since you already know it, I
don't suppose that there's a use for me to explain it to you. I can guide you
in other fields of physics that I'm familiar with." 
</p>


<p>
"It won't be necessary. I'm afraid I'm out of questions to ask you." 
</p>


<p>
"Excellent." I replied, "Because I'm out of answers too: I made an effort
that my answers will be as to the point and as informative as possible, but at
a certain point, I too ran out of available knowledge." 
</p>

<h2 id="with_enemies_like_this_who_needs_friends">8. With Enemies Like This, Who Needs Friends?</h2>
 
<p>
After they took me out of the building of the intelligence agency, I decided
to continue my tour of the Enemy's country with the emphasis on collecting
important intelligence information in indirect means. I started my intelligence
work in a visit I conducted the next day's morning in one of the water parks of
the country. I always wanted to visit a place like that and to amuse myself in
it, and I assumed I can conduct some serious espionage over there. I continued
with guided tours in the main cities and in the ancient cities, a visit to the
theme park, and meals at fancy restaurants. One of the most dangerous espionage
missions I took was a guided tour for expert hikers that included
cliff-hanging. Of course the rest of the tourists that participated in the tour
could have done the same intelligence work I did, but they were not aware of
the great intelligence potential that was inherited in it. 
</p>


<p>
After I completed all those missions I possessed a large amount of
intelligence information about the Enemy. The only fact that could shadow the
success of my mission was that information was not substantially different from
the information I had before I visited its country. In any case, all those
missions exhausted me and I decided to continue in the tour in a less intensive
pace; I decided that I'll just tour the cities of the country in my own pace,
without a defined cause. 
</p>


<p>
So, I had the opportunity of visiting various places, most of which were
completely mundane for the locals, but still pretty interesting for a stranger.
Thus, for instance, I was present in a political assembly of one of the
country's parties. I saw the leader of the party give his speech to the loud
voice of the encouragement calls of those present. I decided to try my
mathematical skills in calculating the sum of the independent opinions of those
present in the crowd, but even I realized that it was hard for me to work with
such low numbers. After I had to change the digital precision three times
during the calculation of the sum of the first ten independent opinions, I
realised it would be too hard for me. 
</p>


<p>
However, I managed to make it up to myself on this failure during that tour.
Two days after that I stumbled into one of the universities there and noticed a
sign that announced a large gathering that took place there that day: "'Out of
the north an evil shall break forth' - a symposium regarding the political
status between us and the Occupier and the Country". I decided it was something
I had to be present in, and therefore I immediately bought an entrance ticket
and entered the lecturing hall. 
</p>


<p>
I noticed that one of the lectures was already in session and the professor
who lectured was just explaining why the present situation made it difficult on
signing a normalization treaty between the Enemy and the Occupier. I found a
vacant seat and sat there. To my side sat a young man that wrote notes in a
notebook he held in his hand. I assumed he was a student. After a few minutes
he turned his look towards me and then his face enlightened from surprise.
"Wait a second," he said "You look familiar. Are you by any chance a famous
person? Wait a second, aren't you the ex-Member of the Organisation?" 
</p>


<p>
"The answer to the first question is 'Yes'." 
</p>


<p>
"So you're not the ex-Member of the Organisation?" 
</p>


<p>
"I wouldn't have deduced it from what I said." 
</p>


<p>
"So you are the ex-Member?" 
</p>


<p>
"That's not something that is derived from what I said either. Sometimes it
just amazes me... " 
</p>


<p>
But he did not stay to hear the rest of the sentence, but rose up and
advanced towards the aisle. He probably identified me with confidence or
assumed I'm the only man in the world who can answer in such a cryptic way. He
hurried to the front of the hall where he spoke with some of the organisers of
the study day. After they whispered between themselves, one of them went on the
stage and whispered something to the lecturer. The lecturer stopped lecturing,
pondered for a moment and then said: "Gentlemen, I was informed right now that
the ex-Member of the Organisation, that as we all know is visiting our country
now, is at the moment present in this hall. Due to the important part he took
in shaping the political status we are discussing today, I ask him to get on
this stage and present us his opinion regarding the Organisation and the
political state that prevails with him." 
</p>


<p>
And so I rose and advanced toward the stage to the hand-clapping of the
audience in the hall. After I went on the stage, the professor shook my hand,
presented me with the microphone and went off the stage himself. I rose my hand
to silence the hand-clapping, waited until they stopped and started to
speak: 
</p>


<p>
"Before I begin with my speech, I'd like to indicate that for the duration
of the speech, I accept Aristotle's Organum. The reason for that is that
otherwise I'll be able to prove any statement as well as its opposite
statement. Therefore, since in this case all the possible statements are true,
I could have finished the speech at this moment, since there's no use for me to
prove them. 
</p>


<p>
As we all know, while the activity of all the other terrorist organisation
that were active in my country was disabled for a long while, and the weaponry
that they possessed was given to the army, the state of the Organisation had
never been better. Why in that case does the Occupier gives him such a broad
freedom of action? The reason for that is that the Organisation is not a
national organisation in the full sense of the word or even in half its sense.
In fact, it's an organisation that fulfills the philosophy of the Supporter,
that strictly opposes the Enemy, but doesn't have an interest to struggle
against the Occupier. 
</p>


<p>
If not for the desire of the Occupier to force the Enemy into a
normalisation treaty, the Organisation wouldn't have survived in his current
form either. Thus, out of being subordinate to an external political force, one
can say that the Organisation is an alien corn in the political map of my
country. But I, on my part, don't find any bad in the integration of foreign
interests in local politics. Allow me to quote on the subject one of the most
important people of our generation: 'Some say: 'Whatever you can do on your
own, you can do best'. I disagree with them'. 
</p>


<p>
Because when you let others meddle in your own business, you slowly lose
control on what you are doing and what happens to you. In a slow but methodical
way, one loses track of his original intentions, one feels that one more and
more doesn't understand why he's doing what he's doing... or for what or for
whose sake you're doing it. And then he gets the feeling that nothing is under
his responsibility, and that he is in fact a vassal of the external factor. And
that is, from experience, the most liberating feeling in the world, which is
accompanied by feeling a complete freedom from responsibility or from the need
to decide the future on your own. 
</p>


<p>
Some will say this liberty will soon be over in a ruin, but this liberty, as
short as it will be, is a liberty without second. Or as this great man once
said: 'Consciousness allows any conscious individual to make his own decisions,
but he is most as ease when he's not making use of his consciousness.'. 
</p>


<p>
Which brings me to the next point: do the members of the Organisation, as
members of my people, have a solid reason to fight the Enemy? Vengeance alone
was never considered a good reason by any reasonable man, and if their desire
is to cause you to get out of the security-zone you are now controlling, then
their struggle against the Enemy doesn't seem too effective. Most of the
politicians in your country are united in their opinion that it has to be kept
as long as the tension goes on, and also most of the military people support
this. For all that, it is possible, that if there will be peace in the south of
my country for an extended time, the Enemy will agree to withdraw from it, out
of knowing that it will not hurt the security of those living close to the
border. 
</p>


<p>
Therefore, unless the Organisation had been motivated by the philosophy of
the Supporter, he would have changed his manner of activity a long time ago.
But since he is subjected to the Supporter, he continues with it without a
change. 
</p>


<p>
Another issue that should be discussed is how much the members of the
Organisation are willing to endanger themselves in their struggle against the
Enemy. That same person, who is in my opinion one of the most influential men
today, tends to say: 'A fearful and senseless person can take actions that only
the bravest person will take, but he usually does not understand why he is
taking them.' Imagine a group of members of the Organisation who infiltrate the
Enemy's lines in the hope of killing soldiers out of its army. Such
infiltration would be presented as fanatical by you and as full of courage by
the Organisation itself. However, it should be remembered that behind every
such "fanatical" action there is a hierarchy of commanders and sub-commanders,
a line of comrades that support and encourage, a whole lot of national and
"ideological" preachers who give flaming speeches against the Enemy (even
though they, usually, are not involved in the physical activity against him),
and a mass of citizens that support this activity and is content with it. All
the weight of this pyramid is placed above the unit of the members of the
Organisation that flies like a cork out of a bottle and walks towards its
death. Taking all this scenario into consideration, the question being raised
is how "fanatical" they really are. 
</p>


<p>
Naturally their decision did not involve much thought, at least not in the
direction that they understand that they are walking towards their death. Or as
the same great man once commented: 'If a terrorist stopped and took ten minutes
to think about his actions, he would lose his sanity.'. I'm not saying the
members of the Organisation are terrorists, but, in my opinion, this statement
applies to them too. 
</p>


<p>
The question you are most concerned by is probably: what is going to happen
in the northern border of your country. About that, allow me to quote that same
influential person once more: 'I agree with the head mystics in our time.
Despite the logical and practical difficulties, predicting an event, is
apparently not so hard after the event had occurred.' 
</p>


<p>
The possibility exists that the Supporter will understand that the
Organisation is useless (at least objectively), and a waste of resources that
are anyhow missing to the Supporter's country. Moreover, it causes the spoiling
of the relationship between it and the countries of the second part of the
world, that detest "terrorists", not to mention the big banks who hold his
debts. As of today, the only obstacle that stops the Supporter from reaching
this realization is the fact that it rejects Aristotle's Organum. 
</p>


<p>
Another possibility that your country have is to try to arrange economical
sanctions on the Occupier, so it will stop the activity of the Organisation.
However, heads of countries are not content to harm the economical activity of
the countries by such sanctions, even if their trade with the Occupier is
limited. As for large private corporations - it's hard for me to believe that
one can convince enough of them to ostracise the Occupier enough for it to harm
his economy in a significant way. Moreover, every company is afraid its
competitors will take this opportunity to try and make a profit on its
account. 
</p>


<p>
There is the option of withdrawing from the security zone. Yet, this thing
doesn't guarantee the cease of the military activity of the Organisation at
all, and could bring to an escalation because there will be a more realistic
danger of harming the lives of citizens who live close to the border. The
acceptance of my proposal could solve the problem for you. Still, there isn't a
full guarantee that it will not be rejected if the heads of the Organisation
will find a way to bypass it, and therefore you should not count on it. 
</p>


<p>
The most practical and fast way to terminate the activity of the
Organisation is, perhaps, to sign a normalisation treaty with the Occupier.
However, the Occupier has its own conditions, that if the Enemy accepts them,
its security in the northern border will decrease significantly. Since the
power of the Occupier is ten times greater than the Organisation's, one can
understand why your country does not rejoice to sign a normalisation treaty
with it, while accepting all the conditions that are inferred from it. 
</p>


<p>
Indeed, it's very hard to deal with the Organisation, which is, in my
personal opinion, one of the most interesting organisations of its kind in the
current century, if not in the entire history. I don't think I have ever heard
about an operational militant organisation that so realiaes the well-known
sentence: 'Give me liberty or give me death'. The only shadow to my admiration,
is that in their case they constantly prefer the second alternative. 
</p>


<p>
To sum up, it can be clearly seen that dealing with the Organisation, even
though it doesn't endanger the very existence and proper functioning of the
Enemy's country, is hard and problematic. This evil that is open from the north
- no one knows when it will close. 
</p>


<p>
Does anybody have any questions?" 
</p>


<p>
I saw that some people from the audience raised their hands and I gave the
permission to speak to a student that sat in front. 
</p>


<p>
"I just wanted to ask", she addressed me, "who said all the sentences you
quoted?" 
</p>


<p>
"Why, I did!" 
</p>


<p>
"Were you also the first who said 'Give me liberty or give me death'?" 
</p>


<p>
"Oh no! That was Patrick Henry, one of the leaders of the American
Revolution." 
</p>


<p>
I saw there were no further questions and so I got off the speaker's stage
to the sound of the hand-clapping of the audience. After I shook the hands of
the professors who organised the study day and stayed to talk with them a
little, I went on my way. 
</p>


<p>
The next day I saw a picture of me giving the speech in the university
appear in the front page of the main newspapers, and from what I understood, a
videotape of the lecture was distributed to the various broadcasting networks
in the world. I thought about claiming percentage off the profit to myself, but
eventually I reached the conclusion that the profits from the book, that will
naturally include the speech, will compensate for the anguish. 
</p>

<h2 id="the_return_home">9. The Return Home</h2>


<p>
Two days after the study day I decided to return home, and therefore I
traveled by buses until the northern border of the Enemy's country, in order to
cross the border to my country. The last bus stopped right next to the border
pass that allowed passage from the Enemy's country to the security zone in the
south of my country, that as I mentioned before the Enemy had under its
control. Actually, citizens of my country who inhabit the security zone make
constant use of this border-pass, in order to work in the sovereign area of the
Enemy's country. 
</p>


<p>
The border guards did not detained me for long after they understood I was
the citizen of the country in the other side of the border, but they advised me
to get out of the zone they possessed as soon as possible. I took one organised
ride that took me outside the security zone, and then I found another car that
was about to go in the direction of my village and took it. After I went off
the car, I walked for a short while by foot until I reached the outskirts of my
village at the late afternoon. 
</p>


<p>
The village seemed more deserted and the amount of people who hanged around
its streets was smaller than usual to this hour. When I came near my house I
understood why: half of my village gathered by my house in what looked like a
party that was conducted for my return. After a few seconds, some people
noticed me and their calls ("Look over there, here he comes!") spread the news
among the entire crowd. Most of them turned their look toward the street in
which I walked and some of them even advanced toward me. 
</p>


<p>
So I found myself surrounded by many blessings, questions and shoulder taps,
but beside the basic reactions ("Thank you.", "Excellent." and many smiles) I
focused on getting a way through the crowd to reach my family. After I got
there at the end and stood in front of both my parents, I told them: "I'm
back." 
</p>


<p>
After two minutes of blessings, hugs, calls and remarks like "How we missed
you" coming from the parents and the more distant family, that stood by them,
my father got to the point: 
</p>


<p>
"So, tell us how it's been!" 
</p>


<p>
The crowd slowly silenced and waited in anticipation to my answer and the
next answers that would come. 
</p>


<p>
" How what exactly has been?" I answered. 
</p>


<p>
"Oh, you know", my mother asked, "how was the interview?" 
</p>


<p>
"Oh! I have a videotape with the interview right here. Didn't you see
it?" 
</p>


<p>
"Of course! And to be honest, we asked someone to tape it for us, too." 
</p>


<p>
"So you know how it's been." 
</p>


<p>
"Well. So - how was in the Enemy's country?" 
</p>


<p>
"Oh, the Enemy's country - that's an entirely different story. Yes. On the
Enemy country I have something very important to tell you. In fact..." 
</p>


<p>
"So get on with it and tell it already." Called one of my cousins. 
</p>


<p>
"All right, I'll get to the point: I came." 
</p>


<p>
"Yes?" 
</p>


<p>
"I saw." 
</p>


<p>
"Yes?" 
</p>


<p>
I understood, after a moment, that they expect to say another thing. 
</p>


<p>
"That's it.", I said. 
</p>


<p>
"And isn't there something else you would like to tell about it?" 
</p>


<p>
"No, because I assume you have already seen the speech I gave that study day
in the university." 
</p>


<p>
And so the reception returned to its course, as I frequently answer people's
questions regarding the trip I took abroad. "Why did you visit the Enemy's
country at all?", I was asked after a short while and I answered: 
</p>


<p>
"Well, the main reason was that I wanted material for my book. However, I
integrated into it the collection of valuable intelligence information about
the Enemy, in a manner that is not considered as illegal by the authorities.
Although I managed to get a lot of information without many disturbances, the
results I came up with are not very satisfying. 
</p>


<p>
As I made clear to myself, most of what I know now, was already known to us,
or we assumed it was like that in the first place. In fact, if I wrote a report
on the information I know about the Enemy, then 48 out of 51 pages, were
already known to us before I took the trip." 
</p>


<p>
"And what about the three remaining pages?" 
</p>


<p>
"Oh, they contain a summary, conclusions and a bibliography." 
</p>


<p>
Some time later, when I was involved in a conversation with my mother, my
sister, a friend of mine from the village and two older neighbours, my mother
burst and said: 
</p>


<p>
"Oh! I forgot to tell you until now, but I talked with out truck driver and
he said he will probably be able to hire you as his employee." 
</p>


<p>
"Very good." I told her, "But, to be honest, I think of starting my own
business. The money I got for the interview in foreign currency is considered a
fortune around here, and it will certainly suffice for starting to build the
business." 
</p>


<p>
"In what did you consider to deal with?" My friend asked. 
</p>


<p>
"Honestly, I didn't really give it much thought. I'm so talented that I
don't have enough talent to determine which one of my talents I should deal
with." 
</p>



<h2 id="epilogue">10. Epilogue</h2>

<p>
He sat on a chair under an arbour in a middle of a European-styled garden.
He was a rather short man with black hair and a small and funny black mustache.
The minute I saw him he already finished eating his breakfast, and he drank
coffee and read the morning paper while wearing army uniform. From what I saw
and described to you even a blind man could have deduced it was Adolf Hitler. I
decided to approach him. 
</p>


<p>
"Sir, " I told him, "I am a big fan of yours." 
</p>


<p>
"Really?" He said as a smile of pleasure came up on his face "I'm very glad
to hear that. Come sit, I always have time for fans." 
</p>


<p>
"Even though I'm not too fond of your actions as a whole, your contribution
to philosophy was quite impressive." 
</p>


<p>
"Pardon? To what contribution are you referring?" 
</p>


<p>
"No; you should not be modest Mr. Hitler - you should not deny that you
contributed a lot to the establishment of a thesis, which is one of the most
important philosophical theses in the last two hundred years. Yes ... It's
obvious to me that you must be feeling..." 
</p>


<p>
"Excuse me again, but I don't understand which philosophical contribution
you are praising at the moment. To praise me is, of course, something that is
always desirable, but I also want to know what is praised. I cannot think of
any special contribution which I contributed to worldwide philosophy." 
</p>


<p>
"Seriously? " I called in wonder, "I never assumed a person like you will
not know of something so significant that he's responsible for. Sir, you were
one of the central philosophers who claimed that morality is equal in fact to
'no morality'." 
</p>


<p>
"Did I claim that?" 
</p>


<p>
"Yes." 
</p>


<p>
"When?" 
</p>


<p>
"Allow me to quote you: 
</p>


<p>
'A people that is deprived of its right is allowed to use any weapon
whatsoever. We don't have a conscience and I hold any weapon I need... I will
do anything that will simplify my politics. I am willing to guarantee the
safety along all the borders and to sign agreements for non-invasion and to
make treaties of friendship with every nation and nation. After all it would be
naive to think, that you should not use such measures just because the future
status may bring you to break these festive agreements.' 
</p>


<p>
Well, don't you agree that you are saying here that the morality one should
act upon is lack of morality?" 
</p>


<p>
"No. This is indeed my quotation, but it does not mean that I think the
Aryans should behave in an immoral way. You see, in this passage I meant that
the members of the Aryan race can, or even should, take those actions in their
struggle against members of lesser races, or against Aryan peoples who stand in
the way of Nazism." 
</p>


<p>
"So you mean a Nazi cannot kill another Nazi, but he is allowed to kill a
Jew or a Negro, or even another Aryan who actively opposes the Nazism?" 
</p>


<p>
"Yes, you can interpret it that way, if you generalise it from the
international politics to the private plane." 
</p>


<p>
"Mr. Hitler, due to your response, your conception seem a lot more human to
me! I take back saying that you claim that morality in fact equals to 'no
morality'." 
</p>


<p>
"I'm glad you think so." 
</p>


<p>
"Yes. Yes. It can be seen that all the time you acted out of that ideology,
and not out of the simplistic ideology that I, by mistake, thought you held
earlier. There's definitely much more reason behind your actions now that
you've enlightened me. 
</p>


<p>
Of course an outsider, who didn't have the chance to speak with you yet,
could have reached the same conclusion I reached based on your actions. After
all, Nazi Germany attacked and destroyed countries, that were mostly Aryan, and
caused the killing of many, among them pure Aryans." 
</p>


<p>
I noticed he was opening his mouth to say something, but I did not let him
speak. "Yes, I know it was done because those countries acted out of Anti-Aryan
interests. Or just because their conquest benefited the welfare of the whole
Aryan race in the long term. I will also not discuss much detention camps,
"purification" acts and other such organized actions in which a large number of
members of Aryan peoples was killed. It's obvious that they can be justified by
similar arguments. 
</p>


<p>
But I'm interested in several hypothetical situations, that did not occur in
real-life. I'd love to know how you would have acted in them." 
</p>


<p>
He seemed a little pleased with my speech: "I definitely agree to reply to
you, so you'll witness the moral purity of the National-Socialistic
ideology." 
</p>


<p>
"I thank you." Then I took out a notebook and a pencil from my pocket, and
opened the notebook in its first page. "Let's start: What would you have done
in case of an ideological attempt of a coup d'etat?" 
</p>


<p>
"What do you mean?" 
</p>


<p>
"Imagine a group of activists, which was active until now in secret, that
energetically opposes your ideology. It turns out, that because of an
intelligence failure, a large percent of the population now supports its views
and it has a large number of enthusiastic and active supporters that are active
for the advancement of their cause." 
</p>


<p>
"And what is the nature of those activists: Socialists? Communists?
Liberals? ... " 
</p>


<p>
"Let's say for simplicity that they are people of my intellect, only as
opposed to me they are sane." 
</p>


<p>
"Okay. And what are their arguments against the Nazism?" 
</p>


<p>
"Well, they claim that the Nazism was meant to enforce the dictatorship of a
ruling and a corrupt group. This thing is done by manipulating common
psychological weaknesses and destructive mental tendencies. This political and
social doctrine is based on a basic mistrust in the ability of the individual
to decide for himself, and a total belief in the ability of the leader to
decide for the public. Likewise it opposes the freedoms of the individual but
believe in an absolute manner that the leader, who is also the founder of the
doctrine, is free to do as he pleases. The ideology of the Nazism is, in their
claim, incredibly subjective, and is based on superstitions that lack any basis
in reality. 
</p>


<p>
They also have a criticism against you: they claim you are charismatic and
manipulative but incompetent for any practical purpose, obsessive and with a
chronic lack of self-esteem. Your racism proves, in their opinion, that you are
infected by the disease that you are spreading, and the number of yells that
you cried out of your free will a long time ago exceeded the boundary of good
manners." 
</p>


<p>
"Wait a second, and people agree with them?", he said in a weak voice as he
moved uncomfortably on his chair. 
</p>


<p>
For the first time in all the events which were depicted in this book, I did
not respond to him, but kept silence and smiled a wide smile. 
</p>


<p>
"O.K. And you want me to tell you how I plan to react against them?" said
the dictator. 
</p>


<p>
"Yes. But you should also know some more things: in their claim, the Nazism
is very destructive and if they will let it go on, it could lead to the loss of
millions and even dozens of millions lives of people. Because of that, and
because of the danger it hides to the individual rights and his freedom, one
must fight the government as powerfully as possible, even through self
sacrifice." 
</p>


<p>
"And you want to know how I am going to deal with them?" 
</p>


<p>
"Of course! But don't you want to know first the percentage of those who
support them?" 
</p>


<p>
"Ahhh... yes." 
</p>


<p>
"Let's start with 10%." 
</p>


<p>
"Then for what do I wait for God's sake? I'll go to the army, to the SS and
tell them to execute or imprison every leader or activist in this movement we
know of. I'll offer large sums of money to those who will hand over the
activists who are hiding. Mass arrests, questionings..." 
</p>


<p>
"According to what the army and the intelligence estimate, such activity
will lead to a civil mutiny from the side of these supporters." 
</p>


<p>
"I am aware of that. But one should remember that at its end, Germany will
be purified from those destructive creeps, who has a handsome amount of Jewish
blood in their veins."  
</p>


<p>
"Ahhh... did I already mention the fact that the leaders of the movement are
pure Aryans?" 
</p>


<p>
"No." 
</p>


<p>
"O.K., allow me to mention it. The leaders of the movement are pure
Aryans." 
</p>


<p>
"And what does this fact have to do with anything?", the dictator said
angrily. 
</p>


<p>
"Did I say it has anything to do with anything?" I answered him in a
question. 
</p>


<p>
Hitler looked confused. Actually, I was also confused but I didn't show
it. 
</p>


<p>
"O.K.," he said "is there anything else you want to know?" 
</p>


<p>
"Yes. What would you have done if the ratio of the supporters was 20%?" 
</p>


<p>
"I told you... executions, arrests..." 
</p>


<p>
"And 30%?" 
</p>


<p>
"Likewise." 
</p>


<p>
"40%?" 
</p>


<p>
He stood up from his chair and said: "The same thing." 
</p>


<p>
"O.K." I said to him, "You clarified your position sufficiently. I
understand your decision, because people from all the political wings agree
that one have to take any measures against ideological activists whose ideology
poses a threat to the proper regime. I'm sure that about a military coup
d'etat, your decision would be completely different." 
</p>


<p>
"Wh... Wh... Wh... " 
</p>


<p>
" 'What' ? " 
</p>


<p>
"Yes. What do you mean by 'military coup d'etat'? Do you mean some kind of
'Sunday's coup' when a couple of military officers try to assassinate me or
something like that?" 
</p>


<p>
"No, of course not. In fact Goring and several generals of the Warmacht lead
this coup. They intend to preserve the Nazism but are not content from you as
their leader." 
</p>


<p>
"And what are their arguments against me?" 
</p>


<p>
"Well, they use a more popular terminology than the first time - they just
claim you're mentally ill, capricious and delusional. Luckily for you, part of
the people still support you." 
</p>


<p>
"Really? How much?" 
</p>


<p>
"10%, for a start." 
</p>


<p>
"From where do you take those situations? O.K. - so I go underground, wage a
war against the people who betrayed me and the forces that support them, and
try to become ruler again." 
</p>


<p>
"Interesting. And what would you do if 20% support you?" 
</p>


<p>
"Excellent! That would give me a better chance of succeeding!" 
</p>


<p>
I wonder if he noticed the bad aspect of the matter. "30%? 40%?", I asked
him. 
</p>


<p>
"Even better!" 
</p>


<p>
Apparently he did not. 
</p>


<p>
So I continued to present to hypothetical situations to him and to ask him
what he would have done if they had happened. As time went by, he became more
relaxed, responded with less emotion, and sat comfortably in his chair. It even
seemed to me that he enjoys the whole deal. After a small hour I finished
questioning him, and then I turned back the pages in my notebook, studied what
I noted down a bit, and closed the notebook. I lifted my head and said to the
dictator: 
</p>


<p>
"Mr. Hitler, I must remark that besides your great contribution to modern
philosophy, I am beginning to think you have an extraordinary gift for
diplomacy. Despite everything you've said, I am still convinced that your
doctrine is not based on the assumption that morality equals 'no morality'. You
definitely allowed for millions of Aryans to fight each other, whether in
battles between armies, civil mutiny or even gang wars. You've come to dividing
Germany and even the entire Aryan race to two camps, equal in their size and
power, which were willing to fight each other until dusk. All that I've
mentioned was done for the sole cause of you staying to rule over Germany. 
</p>


<p>
But bloodshed was not the only act you defended with such a brilliant
strategy. In the course of the investigation you reasoned how you would team
together with Jews, Communists and/or Democrats in order to serve your
interest; how you would agree to be the leader of a large group of clear
anti-Nazis, in hope you'll be able to convert them to Nazism later. You even
agreed to give speeches that boldly deny the Nazi theory in case it would have
left you as a ruler. 
</p>


<p>
If another person would say all that, then most people would think he was
the most selfish and power-hungry person they met. But because of your
extraordinary diplomatic talent, I am still convinced you're doing it out of
high morality, and for a noble cause! I don't have enough words to describe the
deep impression I have from the way you said those things! 
</p>


<p>
Do you have anything to say about it, Mr. Hitler?" 
</p>


<p>
Oh! I wish you could see the look on his face! Actually, I would have also
liked to see the look on his face, but just then I woke up from the dream.
After I woke up, I sat on my two elbows and looked outside the window. It was
before dawn, a few minutes before sunrise, so the sky were a little lit to the
east. Many birds twittered intensively their morning twit - the coldness,
probably, did not disturb them much. After I looked a little at the village
houses, which most of the people in it were still asleep, I removed my elbows
and lied down on bed. 
</p>


<p>
"Damn it!" I said to myself "I was just beginning to warm up..." 
</p>

<p>
                            -- End --
