<a href="http://better-scm.berlios.de/">Version control systems</a>
(also known as "Revision control systems", "source control systems" or
sometimes as part of "software configuration management" systems)
are programs that allow one to maintain various historical versions of
one's data, retrieve earlier versions, and do other operations like
branching or tagging.

This section will give the motivation for why you should start using
version control for your software development and will give a short
demonstration using <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">the
Subversion version control system</a>. Feel free to skip this section
if you're already drinking the version control kool-aid.
