There are three ways to acquire land:
</li>
<li>
On the frontier, it is possible to acquire land by <i>homesteading</i>
it - fencing it, protecting it and proclaiming it is yours.
</li>
<li>
Normal active real estate is transferred from one person to the other
by <i>transfer of title</i>: voluntarily giving it to him.
</li>
<li>
A land that was abandoned can be claimed by <i>adverse possession</i>: moving
in it, fencing it, etc.
</li>
</ul>
