Engineering Studies in the Technion</a></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>
The quality of the material [which is taught in the technion] is very good, in
my opinion. It is quite up to date and relevant to
what we have to learn, with a few exceptions (like the infamous teaching of
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il%40cs.huji.ac.il/msg44728.html">C-Shell</a>
programming in Matam and Mamat). But as a general rule, there aren’t many
complaints here.
</p>

<p>
The material seems to cover basics and foundations instead of cutting-edge
technologies, which is a good thing, in my opinion, because a university’s
purpose is to teach just that. The latter is best taught by experiencing.

day and age. Includes a critique of some other opinions, some useful relations

food for thought.
