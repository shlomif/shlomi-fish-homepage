Perl was introduced in 1987 (4 years before Linux itself), when the 
author, <b class="plain">Larry Wall</b>, released version 1.000 of it. 
The reason for its creation was that Wall was unhappy by the 
functionality that sed, C, awk and the Bourne Shell offered him. He 
looked for a language that will combine all of their best features, 
while having as few disadvantages of its own.
</p>

<p>
Since then, perl has seen several versions, each adding additional 
functionality. perl version 5, which was released in 1994, was a 
complete re-write of the perl interpreter, and introduced such things 
as hard references, modules, objects and lexical scoping. Several minor 
versions of perl appeared since then, and the most up-to-date stable 
version (as of October 2005) is 5.8.x.

<p>
Perl became especially popular as a language for writing server-side
scripts for web-servers. But that's not the only use of perl, as it is 
commonly used for system administration tasks, managing database data, as 
well as writing GUI applications.
