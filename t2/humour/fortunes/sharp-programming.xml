<saying who="joeyadams">lol.  Zuu&#39;s probabilistic, so maybe he can solve you.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">but i guess i have now</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Formal definition of Turing hard:  blah blah blah hard blah blah Turing blah.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">Hahahaha :D</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Wikipedia:   Given a set X in P(N), a set A in N is called Turing hard for X if X &lt;=_T A for all X in X. If additionally A is in X, then A is called Turing complete for X.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Does that clarify?</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_reduction for the actual math symbols)</saying>
<me_is who="joeyadams">assumes you get the point</me_is>
<saying who="Zuu">yeah, i think i&#39;ll have to put significant time into that, for me to comprehend it :)</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">but maybe i will, some day :P</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">My point is that people like to use mumbo jumbo to describe more concise mumbo jumbo.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">E.g. A problem is NP-hard if it is at least as hard as all the problems in NP.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">i undersstand enough of it, to be fairly confident that rindolf being turing hard, will not say much about his ability to be solved</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">I&#39;m guessing Turing-hard means you can&#39;t solve a problem with a Turing machine (e.g. the halting problem)</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">(substitute Turing machine with &quot;your computer&quot; :) )</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">no, turing hard has something to do with expressiveness</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">okay, Zuu &gt; joeyadams, so I can&#39;t help you :)</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">tickles joeyadams ^^</me_is>
<saying who="joeyadams">A delicious apple is any fruit ∈ apple that is at least as tasty as any other fruit ∈ apple.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">In other words, apples are in the set of recursively nommable fruits.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">joeyadams: what&#39;s up?</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">I&#39;m babbling.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">joeyadams: Apple is one of my least favourite fruits.</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">watches a number of apples that recursively NOM&#39;s eathother</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">It tends to be too commonplace.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Or simpleton.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">whoops, my logic is incorrect</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Only delicious apples are ∈ the nommable fruits.</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">(recursively is just a word you throw in to sound smart)</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">NOMs joeyadams :&gt;</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">joeyadams: a friend of one of my sisters said that Apple is his favourite fruit.</saying>

<me_is who="joeyadams">has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection nommed by peer))</me_is>
<saying who="Zuu">yeah, unfortunately a lot of people throw with a lot of words to sound smart :/</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">my favourite fruit is a recursive banana!</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">although it certainly helps to use complex terminology to solve complex problems.  As Aristophanes said, &quot;High thoughts must have high language.&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">.. along with immutable polymorphic pears</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">Zuu&gt; I guess you have to peel it indefinitely?</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">lol</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">Hahah, yeah :P</saying>
<saying who="joeyadams">I tend to eat bananas in deterministic polynomial time.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">i eat them in linear time, but uses exponential space</saying>

<saying who="Zuu">Hi rindolf :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Hi Zuu </saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: I&#39;ve been thinking that maybe you can find some corresponding Zuus of the appropriate sex in a different dimension.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">hmmm... interresting!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: are you a heterosexual Zuu or a homosexual one?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">Im not sure what sex I am.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">:P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: you can look.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: in the mirror or something.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: don&#39;t you have obligatory genders in Danish/</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Like in German, French, etc.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Or Hebrew and Arabic.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">obligatory genders?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">you mean, the genders in linguistics?</saying>
<me_is who="Zuu">never understood those</me_is>
<saying who="Zuu">but Danish have two i believe, and if i remember correctly there is female and &#39;none&#39;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: yes, genders in linguistics.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">i dont remember what which is which though :P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Like in Hebrew &quot;Haben Halakh lagan&quot; - the boy went to the garden. &quot;Habath Halkha lagan&quot; - &quot;The girl went to the garden&quot;</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">That almost sounds like allah akbar</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">rindolf, no we dont distinct between the genders of the subject in the danish language</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">our nouns have genders though</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">zuu-nina?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">like &#39;house&#39; is one gender and &#39;car&#39; is another</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: of course the question is - what language do Zuus speak natively?</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">rindolf: Of course, Zuu speaks Zuu!</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuuish?</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">The Zulu population also does not speak Zuluish, just Zulu.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">so if you want to say &#39;the house&#39; its &#39;huse_t_&#39; and if you want to say &#39;the car&#39; its &#39;bile_n_&#39;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">c_sphere: Arnavoth (sounds like an Aztec god) is &quot;Hares&quot; (the Rabbit-like mammal) in Hebrew.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: can you understand Swedish?</saying>
<saying who="c_sphere">Aemeth</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">rindolf, some :)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">swedish branched from danish afaik</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">same with norwegian</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">yes, Zuu&#39;s speak Zuuish nativley :P</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">is listening to Hans Zimmer - Jack Sparrow</me_is>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: ah.</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">Zuuish have few words, all of which is based on words about cake from othre languages :P</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">c_sphere, are you by any chance related to s_cube ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: ah, what do you use the Hebrew word &quot;עוגיה&quot; (= `ugiyah, cookie) for?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">&quot;Chocolate chip pie crust marmalade marzipan cookie yum yum!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">i use it for cookies baked from a hebrew recipe :P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">What does it mean in Zuuish?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">it&#39;s hard to really say something in Zuuish... al you can really do is say something equivalent to &quot;COOKIES!!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">or &quot;YAY CAKE!&quot;</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">basically, you can only express excitement over different kinds of cakes :P</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Zuu: do Zuus eat anything except cakes or cookies?</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">There was this one time...</saying>
<saying who="Zuu">wait.. no. That was someone else.</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">Chekov: I disagere with what ESR says in TAOUP that you shouldn&#39;t apply factor optimisations. I think they can make a very large difference.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Chekov: he seems to imply you should wait until computers are fast enough.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Problem is people don&#39;t want to upgrade and if a competing program (maybe a fork ) is much faster, then some of them will switch.</saying>
