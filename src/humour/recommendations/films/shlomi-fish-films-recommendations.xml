<p>
This is my favourite movie, and the favourite of a lot of others from
my generation. It has an excellent dialogue, with many power sentences. The
acting is excellent, and the film is very enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
The Princess Bride has the format of a classic fairy tale, but with a few
interesting and non-ordinary twists. It is funny, engaging and highly
recommended.

<p>
    Spaceballs is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Essentially a
    parody of Star Wars and other Science-Fiction films, this films features
    Druish Princesses, mercenaries who “don’t do it for money”, but rather
    for “a shitload of money”, and an old small alien guru who claims that you
    should “never underestimate the power of the Schwartz”.
</p>

<p>
    I’ve seen this movie several times, and also watched or linked many
    meme-scenes on YouTube.

<p>
<i>Last Action Hero</i> is a film where a young boy is transferred
into an absurd world where his imaginary hero, Jack Slater
(played by <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/bad_acting_arnie.xhtml">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> ),
is real whereas many truisms that we take for granted in
"the real world" do not hold.
</p>

<p>
<i>Last Action Hero</i> theme of self-reference, strange loops,
and real vs. imaginary <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/nav-blocks/blocks/#self_ref_sect">influenced my own works</a>.

                            Disney movies. It’s funny, fun, with a lot
                            of great songs and other music, with many jokes
                            and anecdotes, and with a great plot.

                        <p>
                            I’ve seen it several times and always enjoyed
                            it. I’ve also read the first two books in the
                            series, and they are very nice, but very different
                            from the film.

<p>
A wonderful French bittersweet comedy that takes place in early-2000
France. Amélie is a young woman who was raised in solitude, and is
starting to familiarise herself with the outside world. She tries to do
good deeds to her loved ones, and avenge a man she hates.
</p>

<p>
Funny, exciting, and engaging - Amélie is a wonderful movie.

<p>
I saw this movie several times on television, and liked what I saw. An
Irishman decides to popularise his Bed and Breakfast hotel by pretending
it is a ghost castle and inviting several American guests to stay there.
But much to everyone’s surprise, real actual ghosts appear and start
haunting the living.
</p>

<p>
My favourite quote from the movie is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Oh my God, What have I done? Oh my God! What have I done? Oh my God! What
a woman!
</p>
</blockquote>

                        <p>
                            The Naked Guns are among the funniest movies
                            I’ve ever seen. I’ve watched them many times
                            on T.V. (and watched the third one originally
                            in the cinema), and enjoy them almost every time
                            I watch them.

                            of his friends. The movies have a lot of jokes,

                            to absurd situations.

                            It tells the story of a lovable, but multi-phobic
                            psychiatric patient, who at his mature age has
                            already accumulated a lot of psychiatric
                            pseudo-knowledge. He follows his recent successful
                            psychiatrist on his vacation, and slowly drives
                            him mad. This setting enables many jokes, gags,
                            and positively great humour.

                            This is a sports comedy about an award-winning
                            San-Diego-based cheerleading squad that discovers
                            that its departing Captain stole their moves from
                            a different squad from a run-down part of Los
                            Angeles. As the Toros struggle to get their
                            act together, there’s a lot of fun to be seen.

                            It’s hard for me to know what I exactly like
                            about this movie, but there are probably many
                            things to like. Kirsten Dunst acts great as
                            usual and I always adore her facial expressions.
                            Eliza Dushku and Gabrielle Union are also good.
                            It’s a fun movie, which I enjoyed watching several
                            times, and it’s still fun.

                        <p>
                            This series of movies takes on the decades-old
                            fascination of science-fiction writers with
                            time travel, and combines it with a lot of zany
                            humour, high-paced action, a great plot, wonderful
                            acting, and a superb setting.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly, a hip kid
                            who is friends with Dr. Emmett Brown (the excellent
                            Christopher Lloyd), a Mad Scientist who invents
                            a time machine that causes a mess-up in Marty’s
                            past, future, and present, and a wacky
                            attempt to restore it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The two first parts of the trilogy are really
                            fun, with the second being more wacky and
                            high-paced. The third part is not as good,
                            but still worth the watch, if only for closure.

                        </p>

                        <p> Melvin Udall: Now, I got a real great compliment
                        for you, and it's true.  </p>

                        <p> Carol Connelly: I'm so afraid you're about to say
                        something awful.  </p>

                        <p> Melvin Udall: I've got this, what, ailment? My
                        doctor, a shrink that I used to go to all the time, he
                        says that in fifty or sixty percent of the cases, a
                        pill really helps. I hate pills. Very dangerous thing,
                        pills. Hate. I'm using the word "hate" here, about
                        pills. Hate. My compliment is, that night when you came
                        over and told me that you would never... all right,
                        well, you were there, you know what you said. Well, my
                        compliment to you is, the next morning, I started
                        taking the pills.  </p>

                        <p> Carol Connelly: I don't quite get how that's a
                        compliment for me.  </p>

                        <p> Melvin Udall: You make me want to be a better man.
                        </p>

                        <p> [pause] </p>

                        <p> Carol Connelly: [stunned] That's maybe the best
                        compliment of my life.  </p>

                        <p> Melvin Udall: Well, maybe I overshot a little,
                        because I was aiming at just enough to keep you from
                        walking out.  </p>

                                Wars</a>. I watched these movies on video
                            as a child, and recall liking them a lot. Star
                            Wars is a mixture of Science Fiction, Fantasy,
                            and Adventure, with a lot of vivid imagination,
                            wonderful special effects (especially for
                            its time) and an engaging plot.

<p>
This is a relatively obscure, but a positively beautiful and touching, science
fiction film. A human pilot ends up stranded on a strange planet, beside a
reptilian humanoid-like alien, who belongs to a race, which the humans are at
war with. While initially being enemies, they learn to cooperate with each
other, speak each other’s language, and eventually even love and care for
each other.
</p>

<p>
There are some twists to the plot after that, and the movie kept me captivated.
Unfortunately, the movie budget’s had gone out of proportion, in part due
to a change of director, and it was not successful commercially. But watching
it on the Television proved to be an engaging experience for me when I was
younger.

<p>
An adaptation to film of the first part of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neverending_Story">the
Novel <i>The Neverending Story</i> by Michael Ende</a> (which I’ve read later
and can also recommend). The film is aesthetically pleasing, with wonderful
special effects, exotic fantastical creatures, great acting, and wonderful
and atmospheric music.
</p>

<p>
This is one of the finest fantasy movies I’ve ever seen, and I highly
recommend it.

                            A fantasy film based on a story by George
                            Lucas. An evil queen-sorceress is told that
                            a newborn baby-girl will end up killing her, and
                            orders her to be killed. The girl’s mother
                            puts her cradle on the river, where it ends
                            up being found by Willow, a member of a
                            village of a Hobbit-like race of men.

                     Bowie was great and Jennifer Connelly was so touching and
                     maybe could have taken the Oscar if there was no prejudice

                            This is my favourite of the new crop of Disney
                            animated films. Inspired by African legends,
                            the Lion King tells the story of a lion cub,
                            who learns about the place of his kind in Nature.

                            but there are some obvious anti-Fascist elements
