Introduction

I have long wondered how can I show PCX graphics files in my C programs.
Recently, I managed to write this header and library files to achieve this
task and I decided to distribute it so fellow programmers won't face the same
problem.
Included in the archive is a a document PCX.DOC, which explains the structure
of the PCX format and how to program it. By reading this document, you can
program your own routines to decrypt or encrypt PCX files. I have an
important remark about the document: In the monochrome, CGA and EGA mode the
first pixels inside the byte are given by the highest bytes, and the last by
the lowest. Also, in EGA the file has four planes each contains one bit of
the half-byte specifying the EGA color.
This text files explains how to use the library. Please read it thoroughly.
I hope you will make the most out of this library.

							 I. Pre-decrypting Initialization

1) The global variables EGA_RGB_CON & VGA_RGB_CON

These global variables control how will the function PCX_ReadHeader() process
the RGB palette info of the EGA and VGA files.
You can use RGB_CON_TYPE to set those global variables:
- Use G_EGA_Reg_CON for EGA_RGB_CON if you have an EGA-compatible graphics
driver and you want to set the colors in the regular 2 bit per element
(64 colors) mode.
- Use G_Borland_CON for either variable if you want to use 4 bit values
for each element. (It is sometimes used in the function setrgbpalette() in
Borland C++).
- Use G_BIOS_CON for either variable if you want to use 6 bit values (the BIOS
256 VGA default) for every element. You will probably use it to show an EGA or
VGA bitmap in a 256-color VGA driver.
- Use G_TrueColor_CON for either if you want to use 8 bit values for
every element. It will be probably used to display an EGA or VGA bitmap on a
XGA or 24-bit driver.

2) The user-defined display macros
The macros G_PIXEL_2(x, y, col), G_PIXEL_4(x, y, col), G_PIXEL_16(x, y, col),
G_PIXEL_256(x, y, col), G_PIXEL_24Bit(x,y,r,g,b) are used by the function
PCX_GetImage() to put a pixel on the screen. (If you chose to display the
bitmap on screen while reading the file.) The user has to define them using
apropriate functions. (They were defined since graphical display functions
differ considerably between compilers and you might use an add-on library to
control your display.)
Each macro has affects only one type of image : G_PIXEL_2 displays a pixel
for monochrome bitmaps, G_PIXEL_4 is used for CGA bitmaps, G_PIXEL_16 for
EGA pictures, G_PIXEL_256 for VGA 256-color ones and G_PIXEL_24Bit for 24-bit
images.
Parameters 'x' and 'y' specify the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the
pixel respectively. Parameter 'col' specifies the color number, and parameters
'r', 'g' and 'b' specify the red, green and blue values for 24-Bit images.

								  II. The Decrypting Process

1) Preparing the file stream

The first thing you have to do is to open a file stream for the desired PCX
file. Declare a FILE * pointer and open it using the fopen() function. You should
open it as a read-only binary file.

2) The PCX_ReadHeader() function

After opening the file stream you have to use the function PCX_ReadHeader().
Its declaration is:
	struct PCX_FILE PCX_ReadHeader (FILE * f, unsigned char * palette)

The parameter 'f' is the file stream you opened.
The parameter 'pallete' is a pointer to the place in memory where the pallete
information will be saved. The size and contents of the pallete varry
according to the bitmap mode:
- In CGA - The first byte will state the mode, and the second will state the
  background color.
- In EGA - For every color out of the 16 there will be three bytes with its
  red, green and blue values (48 bytes total). The data will be arranged
  according to the colors numerical order.
- In VGA - Same as EGA except there will be values for all 256 colors (768
  bytes total).
( In both EGA and VGA modes the RGB values will be processed according to the
global variables EGA_RGB_CON and VGA_RGB_CON. See I.1 for more information)

The function returns a PCX_FILE structure. The structure will be used next
in the decrypting process.

3) The PCX_FILE structure contents

This structure is declared as follows:
struct PCX_FILE
{
	FILE * file_ptr;
	int Type;
	unsigned Xlen, Ylen, BytesPerLine;
	unsigned char * palette;
};

'file_ptr' is a pointer to the file stream (which you opened previously).
'Type' contains the type of the image :
	0 - Monochrome.
	1 - 4-colors CGA.
	2 - 16-colors EGA.
	3 - 256-colors VGA.
	4 - 24-Bit Image.
	100 - Unknown image type.
	200 - An error occured in function ReadHeader().
(You can use the enumeration Graphics_File_Type for reading information from
'Type').

'Xlen' and 'Ylen' are respectively the width and height of the image in
pixels.
'BytesPerLine' - Contains how many bytes are in one line of information.
Note: This refers to the PCX file, not the information in memory. The item is
mainly for internal use.
'pallete' - Contains a pointer for the pallete information.

4) The PCX_GetImage() function

Before you call this function make sure that the palette was set using the
palette information. The function has the following declaration:
	int PCX_GetImage(struct PCX_FILE pcx, int xpos, int ypos, unsigned char * buf, int target)

The various parameters:
'pcx' - the PCX_FILE structure obtained using ReadHeader().
'xpos', 'ypos' - The horizontal and vertical coordinated of the picture upper-
left corner.
'buf' - a buffer pointer for putting the decrypted image information or for
temporary function use.
'target' - Its value specifies whether the bitmap should be presented on
screen, written to memory or Both. G_Screen for presenting the bitmap on
screen only, G_Buffer for only writing the bitmap to memory, and G_Both for
both.

Return Value:
	On Succes - 0;
	On failure - 1;

This function reads the bitmap information of the PCX file. It either decrypts
the information into a memory buffer, or present it on screen in the specified
location, or do both at once. Even if you specify that it won't store the
image in memory, you should make at least pcx.BytesPerLine bytes available at
the buffer 'buf'.
When stored in memory every monochrome pixel will be given by one bit, every
CGA pixel by two bits,  every EGA pixel by four bits, every VGA pixel by
one byte and every 24-Bit pixel by 3 bytes. Every horizontal line will be
rounded to the next byte. Here how to calculat the line lengthes of every
mode:
	Monochrome - Xlen/8 + (Xlen%8!=0)
	CGA -        Xlen/4 + (Xlen%4!=0)
	EGA -        Xlen/2 + Xlen%2
	VGA -        Xlen
	24 Bit -     Xlen*3

Note that inside every byte in the black&white, CGA or EGA modes, the earliest
(leftmost) pixels are given in the high bytes and the rightmost pixels at the
low bytes. Here are sample procedures to get the (x,y) pixel from the bitmap
stored in memory:
	Monochrome - bread(buf[y*(Xlen/8 + (Xlen%8!=0)) + x/8], 7-x%8)
	CGA -        qread(buf[y*(Xlen/4 + (Xlen%4!=0)) + x/4], 3-x%4)
	EGA -        buf[y*(Xlen/2 + Xlen%2) + x/2]&(x?0xf:0xf0)
	VGA -        buf[y*Xlen + x];
	24 Bit -     (buf[(y*Xlen + x)*3], buf[(y*Xlen + x)*3+1], buf[(y*Xlen + x)*3+2]) (for every element seperately)

See also 'Using the Assistant Functions' at the next section.

						  III. Using the Assistant Functions

There are four assistant functions included in the header and the are:

void bwrite(unsigned char * c, unsigned place, unsigned value)
unsigned int bread(unsigned char c, unsigned int place)

void qwrite(unsigned char * c, unsigned place, unsigned value)
unsigned int qread(unsigned char c, unsigned int place)

They are used to input or output bits and byte-quarters (2 bit chunks).
Here is a short explanation on every function.

bwrite - Changes the bit number 'place' in byte '*c' to 'value'.
bread - Returns the bit value of bit number 'place' in byte 'c'.
qwrite - Changes the quarter number 'place' in byte '*c' to 'value'.
qread - Returns the quarter value of quarter number 'place' in byte 'c'.

Here is a diagram of a byte to help you understand:
