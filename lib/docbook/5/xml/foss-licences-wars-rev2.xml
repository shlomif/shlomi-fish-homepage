        <title>Introduction</title>
    </info>

    <para>
        When <link xlink:href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky
            (“Joel on Software”)</link> wrote his notorious blog post
        <link xlink:href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01.html">“Language
            Wars”</link>, many people asked whether he has
        “jumped the shark” and that his blog will go downhill from there. I too have read
        the post, and agreed, that while it had a few good points, it was
        too based on “feeling rather than knowing”. Joel later on posted
        many good articles and shorter entries on his blog, but many people
        still recalled it as a very low-point in the blog.
    </para>

    <para>
        Like Joel, I have a home-site and several blogs, where I post articles
        and essays about my thoughts, and this time I’ve decided to risk
        something similar to what Joel has done on an equally flamatory topic:
        <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_licence">licences
            of open-source software</link>. I’m going to introduce the various
        options, explain a little about their motivation and then
        give some advice according to my own personal opinion.
    </para>

    <para>
        I should note that I am not a lawyer, and only write this according
        to my best knowledge, understanding and experience.
        <footnote xml:id="ianal" label="IANAL">
            <para>
                Some people believe that discussing legal matters should be
                reserved to people who are Law experts. However, this is
                a <link xlink:href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=39148&amp;cid=62149">sub-case
                    of the “only specialists should deal with a specialised
                    field” fallacy</link>.
            </para>
            <para>
                Like it or not, the Law affects us all and the Government
                expects common citizens to be aware of it and not violate
                it, even if they are not lawyers. As software developers, we
                do not limit discussions on software and computing to people
                with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science (much less a
                Ph.D. or whatever) and often not-too-qualified people can be
                very knowledgeable and/or productive.
            </para>
            <para>
                Similarly, I expect discussions on the governmental law to
                have a lower barrier for entry than people who are qualified
                lawyers, or Law Professors.
            </para>
        </footnote>
        I think what I’m writing here is correct, but would still appreciate
        any correction for future versions. If you’re unsure about my advice,
        then you should consult a legal expert (if you
        can afford one) or your local or global Free and Open Source Software
        organisation. I cannot guarantee my advice is valid.
    </para>
    <section xml:id="spoiler">
    <info>
        <title>Spoiler</title>
    </info>

        <para>
            In this spoiler I’ll explain what I’m using right away, which is
            also what I recommend other people to use. When I started
            releasing my code as open-source software, I used <link
                xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">the
                Public Domain</link>. So, for example,
            <link xlink:href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</link>
            which is one of my earliest projects and still one
            of the most successful, used to carry a
                <filename>COPYING</filename> file with the
                following contents:
        </para>
        <blockquote>
            <para>
                Relax, this is not GPL software, but rather it is distributed
                under the public domain. It means it can be linked against
                anything, converted to any different license, freely used and
                distributed, and anything else without any restrictions
                whatsoever. No Strings Attached!™
            </para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>
            (This was also a joke of sorts.)
        </para>

        <para>
            Later on, to avoid the problematic status of public domain code
            in many countries, and to avoid other potential legal problems,
            I started distributing my original code under <link
                xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_license">the
                MIT X11 Licence</link>, a permissive licence which is
            close to the Public Domain. If the project I’m
            contributing to has a different licence, then I disclaim any
            explicit or implicit ownership on the code I wrote, and allow
            the existing copyright holders to do with my code as they see
            fit.
        </para>

        <para>
            Note that I’m using different terms for other types of
            digital artworks. Most of my essays (including this one) are
            under the <link xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative
                Commons Attribution Licence</link>, my original (i.e:
            non-derived-work or fan-art) fictitious stories are often under
            <link xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">the
                Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike Licence</link>
                or <link xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons — Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</link>
            (which is more GPL-like), and most of the
            photos I took and published were placed under the Public Domain.

                    The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to
                    your needs. Access to the source code is a precondition
                    for this.

                    The freedom to improve the program, and release your

                    benefits . Access to the source code is a precondition
                    for this.
                </para>

        </listitem></orderedlist>

        <para>

            The <link
                xlink:href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.php">Open
                Source definition</link> is similar, but some licences can
            qualify as open-source and not as free software. This is usually
            not an issue, because the majority of open source software out
            there is free as well. (And few people would like to create an
            open-source licence that’s not endorsed by the Free Software
            foundation.)

        </para>

        <para>
            A software licence qualifies as a free software/open-source
            licence, if it allows those four freedoms. There’s still a lot of
            room to manoeuvre and to impose various restrictions, but otherwise
            these freedoms make them usable enough for the users and
            co-developers.

    <info>
        <title>Permissive Licences</title>
    </info>

        <para>
            The first type of licences are
<link
                xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_free_software_licence">Permissive
                free software licences</link>, also
            known as
            <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD-style
                licences</link>, or
            <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycenter">
                “Copycenter licences”</link>. These licences allow you to do almost
            anything conceivable with the program and its source code,
            including distributing then, selling them, using the resultant
            software for any purpose, incorporating into other software,
            or even converting copies to different licences, including
            that of <link
                xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">non-free
                (so-called “proprietary”) software</link>.
        </para>

        <para>
            Probably the only two actions none of these licences
            allow is removing the original copyright notice, or suing the
            creator of the software for damages (the latter is due to the
            “no warranty” clause). Some of them pose some additional
            requirements that
            do not detract from their permissive nature.
        </para>

        <para>
            Prominent examples of Public Domain licences include:
        </para>

        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>

                        various BSD licences</link>, under which
                    the “Berkeley Software Development” UNIX variant
                    were made available. The original 4-clause
                    BSD licence contained an additional <link
                        xlink:href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">advertising clause</link>,
                    that required publishing the names of the copyright
                    holders on every advertising material. This proved
                    to be a problem and was rendered GPL-incompatible
                    and so using this licence is no longer recommended.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Later on, the advertising clause was removed to formulate
                    the 3-clause and 2-clause BSD licences, which are both less
                    problematic and GPL-compatible.

            Strong copyleft licences go a step further from weak copyleft
            licences and mandate that any distributed software that links or
            otherwise incorporates such code be licensed under compatible
            licences, which are a subset of the available open-source
            licences. As a result, these licences have been called “viral”.

                        which has two common primary versions - version 2 and
                        version 3. The GPL has a complicated language (I read
                        the GPL version 2 once and did not fully understand it)
                        and has some additional restrictions beyond just making

                        Note that there is a difference between the GPL version
                        2, and the GPL version 3 and that they are mutually
                        incompatible. Some people use the language “Licensed

                        at your option any later version” which avoids this

                        for use in their Berkeley DB database product. The reason
                        this licence was chosen instead of the GPL was because
                        the source for the Berkeley DB was originally written
                        under one of the BSD licences, and it was not clear
                        whether it was possible to sub-license it under the

                        that it is both recursive (requires code that originated
                        from it to be licensed under the same licence) and that
                        it mandates releasing the source code of software
                        applications that linked against it, but under a
                        non-specified (and possibly non-free) licence.

                        Sleepycat has also provided a commercial licence for
                        using Berkeley DB which allows incorporating it into a
                        larger work without the need to release the source.
                        This is a valid business model used by originators of
                        GPL-licensed software and other strong copyleft

        The Artistic Licence was later clarified into the Clarified Artistic
        Licence which incorporated the minimum changes to make it “free” and
        GPL-compatible, and now has a new and improved version - Artistic 2.0,
        which is considered free and GPL-compatible by everybody, and is
        generally preferable for newer projects.

    Moreover, the Apache 2.0 Licence was specifically phrased to be
    GPL-compatible, and is considered GPL compatible by the Apache Software
    Foundation, but the FSF concluded that, while it was a free-software
    licence, it was not compatible with the GPLv2 (although it is with the
    GPLv3 that was published afterwards). Their legal teams still disagree
    on that matter.

Debian legal team concluded that they were not free up to version 3.0, which
was.

    I should note that I have issues with the entire Debian policy of
including only free-as-in-speech material in their distribution, regardless
of its type. I don’t feel that non-software-content (e.g: documents in human
languages, graphics, audio, video, animations, non-code binary data, etc.)
should be treated by the same rules as software, and even
<link xlink:href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/09/191257">Richard

    Another curious licence is the <link
        xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License">Affero GPL</link> -
- which aims to close the “Application Service Provider Loophole”. What it
means is that if I install an AGPLed program on a public web-server and modify
it then I must make my modifications public. However, <link
    linkend="what-is-a-free-software-licence">the Free Software
    Definition</link> , says that one must have “The freedom to study how the
program works, and adapt it to his needs.”. As a
result, I personally don’t consider the AGPL as free (because I may wish to
run it on my publicly accessible web-server and modify it), but the FSF
thinks otherwise. We have enough problems with the suitability of the GPL for
embedded systems, that we don’t need to kill the prospering web-apps market too.

                     source as a trade secret. And many copyleft licences
                     include terms that prevent any part of software covered by

        Now that we covered the controversy of whether some licences are
        open-source/free software or not, let’s move on to which licence you
        should choose. I’ll start with some bad ideas of what not to do.

            Well, I’m not sure it is a bad idea, but choosing a licence for a
            non-FOSS program is out of the scope for this document.
            I’m not going to stop you from trying, but neither can I help
            you with the licence choice. My best advice is to consult
            a lawyer.

        <para>
            Now, since version 2 of the GPL is incompatible with version
            3, and vice-versa (due to the additional restrictions imposed
            by version 3) you shouldn’t choose GPLv2-only or GPLv3-only or
            GPLv3-and-above, because some projects may be licensed only under
            one of them. Also, the version 3 of the LGPL is incompatible with
            the GPLv2, so you shouldn’t choose it either.
            GPL-version-2-or-above or LGPL-version-2.1-or-above should be
            OK in this respect.

            You shouldn’t phrase your own licence and hope it will be

        <para>
            Using your own custom licence deprives you of the benefit of using
            a well-reviewed, well-understood and debugged licence. This is
            similar to writing your own program from scratch instead of using
            an existing, well-tested software solution that already provides
            that functionality. (Thanks to Omer Zak for this analogy.)

        <para>
            The GNU General Public Licence (GPL) and GNU Lesser General
            Public Licence (LGPL) contain many additional restrictions to the
            concept of copyleft, and are very misunderstood, over-hyped, and
            don’t maintain compatibility with newer versions. Even
            <link xlink:href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.642822.36">the LGPL is
            reportedly problematic</link>
        </para>


        <para>
            The GPL and LGPL are of more political nature than other similar
            FOSS licences, and as such should be avoided. I recommend using the
            <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepycat_License">Sleepycat
                licence</link>, which is a strong-copyleft licence, that is
            compatible with GPLv2 and above, instead of the GPL and the
            <link xlink:href="#MozillaPL">MPL</link> 2.0 (or above) licence
            instead of the LGPL. Naturally,
            permissive, non-copyleft, open-source licences such as the MIT
            Expat Licence are an option. What the Sleepycat licence says
            is that code distributed under it, must remain under it, and
            that one must release the source code for publicly-distributed
            binaries that link against it. However, from my understanding, as
            opposed to the GPL, this source code doesn’t have to be completely
            free. It doesn’t have the additional
            restrictions on licences compatibility that the GPL has, nor does
            it have the other obscure and not-well-understood restrictions
            that the GPL has.
        </para>

        <para>
            I read the GPLv2 originally once and couldn’t understand it. The
            LGPLv2 or the GPLv3 would likely prove to be more problematic.
            I find it harder to trust lengthy documents that I am unable to
            understand. I had no problem understanding the Sleepycat licence,
            the Artistic 2.0 licence, or the MIT X11 and BSD licences,
            so I can better recommend them instead.

                By using such permissive licences, one has much fewer worries
                on how people can violate one’s licence. While I commonly
                hear about GPL violations, I don’t ever recall hearing
                about a violation of a permissive, BSD-style licence.

            comment</link> about the fact that GPL (or other strong copyleft
        licences) prevent threats to free and open source software. I’d like to
        reply to it here.

    </para>

    <para>
        Quoting from the comment:
    </para>

    <blockquote>
        <para>

            In the second half of the 90s, <link
                xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X-Windows</link>
            was quite popular - a
            department (in universities, companies, etc.) would have strong
            Unix workstations (from Sun, DEC, SGI, HP and other vendors) and
            people would have cheaper machines showing the output from the
            strong machine using X-Windows. As MS-Windows grew popular, people
            wanted to use their PC running Windows to display X-Windows
            sessions. But unfortunately, the only X server available for
            Windows was commercial software (Exceed), which could happen
            because X was BSD-licensed and not GPL. Users (at the time, most
            had corporate or university funds - they weren’t home users) bit
            the bullet and paid. It took literally years before a free X server
            for Windows became available.

        </para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>
        My response is that this was indeed a problem and inconvenienced the
        users of Exceed. However, if X-Windows were GPLed, then the
        people who made Exceed and wanted to sell it, might not have made it
        in the first place, because they had to make it GPLed and keep
        it as FOSS. So either they would have implemented it from scratch or
        not at all. It is possible that a different group would have created a
        free X server for Windows, but it is possible that no free X server
        would have been available at all. And if a different group
        could have created a free X server for Windows without Exceed, they
        could have certainly created it with it.
    </para>

    <para>
        Furthermore, If X11 had been initiated under a non-BSD-style-licence,
        then it is possible it would not have become as ubiquitous as it is in
        the UNIX world, thus making it irrelevant to port it to Windows in the
        first place. We can’t tell that for sure, but I think it is a
        possibility.
    </para>

    <para>
        Quoting again:
    </para>

    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <para>
            For example, someone integrated my <link xlink:href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver library</link> in a
            <link xlink:href="http://www.ambermango.com/php/am/f3d/index.php">shareware

                (without source) game he wrote titled Freecell 3D</link>.
        </para>

        <para>
            He sells the game online. It did not do any damage, because
            there are plenty of Freecell implementations around. I on my part
            am pretty happy with the open-source PySolFC.
        </para>

        </blockquote>

<para>
Let’s imagine that you wrote a great Freecell solver library, but you suck at
UI and failed to create a graphical game based on that library, and wish that
someone created a UI on top of your library. If your library is BSD, someone
could create this UI but make it commercial and not even you can use it.
If your library is GPL, this person is forced to either make his code public
(so you and your friends can use it) or pay you for a new license.
Which of those scenarios will make you happier? I can’t see how the GPL isn’t
better in this scenario.
</para>

</blockquote>

<para>
    Well, first of all I should note that that is a lot of “if”’s. When I
    started working on Freecell Solver, there were already plenty of graphical
    Freecell games, possibly with support for other variants of Solitaire. And
    there were also several open-source ones, including some very polished
    ones.
</para>

<para>
    As a result, I could have easily integrated my solver into one of them. So
    his thought experiment is not very realistic, although it may be valid in
    the general case.
</para>

<para>
    Back to the thought experiment, a person who would be interested in
    creating a commercial Freecell UI and still integrate a solving mechanism
    to it could:
</para>

<orderedlist>

    <listitem>
        <para>
            Develop his own Freecell solving library from scratch. That will
            probably be less work than developing the rest of the
            graphical Freecell game.
        </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
        <para>
            Write a command line executable that uses the library, invoke it,
            and process its output. This strategy was taken by the developers of
            the open-source
            <link
                xlink:href="http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/">PySolFC</link> out of
            convenience using my existing “fc-solve” executable.
        </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
        <para>
            Write a GPLed server for solving Freecell that the graphical
            game would communicate with using TCP/IP or a different IPC
            mechanism.
        </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
        <para>
            Decide that developing a graphical game only to later release it
            as free software won’t be worth his time, and as a result not
            develop it at all.
        </para>
    </listitem>

</orderedlist>

<para>
    In all of these cases, we won’t have a graphical game as FOSS.
</para>

<para>
    Finally I’d rather have a proprietary derived work than no derived
    program at all, or that instead someone will duplicate my effort in
    creating a BSD-style or a proprietary replacement for my work.
</para>

<section xml:id="why-I-prefer-permissive-licences">
<info>
<title>Addendum: Why I prefer Permissive Licences?</title>
</info>
<para>
In my coverage of the reasons of why I prefer public domain licences
instead of weak copyleft or strong copyleft licences, I probably
missed the one that was the most important for me.
</para>
<para>
I’ll start with a little history. Back when I got my first computer
- an 8088 PC XT with two 5.25" 360 KB diskette drives, and no hard
disk, I started programming in BASIC - first the one that came on
the BIOS and then BASIC.COM or GWBASIC. (BASICA wouldn’t run on my
computer, for some reason). Back then, I programmed mostly games and
my friends and I shared tips and programs between ourselves.
</para>
<para>
I took a long break from programming, and then started programming
BASIC again - this time
<link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBasic</link>.
Then I got my father to buy a C compiler and he bought me Turbo C++,
which I used for somewhat more “serious” stuff than BASIC (though I
still used QBasic). Back then I wrote two libraries-of-sorts -
called CCalc (for various mathematical routines) and CSee (for
graphics) which I intended to distribute as shareware. I don’t
recall if I planned to include the source.
</para>
<para>
I’ve now made them, and some other C code from that era,
<link xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/nostalgia/">available
as free and open source software under the Expat Licence</link>.
</para>
<para>
In any case, back then we were used to the fact that we have to pay
for our software, so I probably thought that making these libraries
public-domain was not worth it.
</para>
<para>
After I started getting into the world of UNIX, Linux, GNU, and
open-source I realised there was a lot of software out there
distributed with the source, which I could download and compile. I
used to think of prep.ai.mit.edu (the old primary FTP host for
gnu.org) as a cool collection of source code, which I could
download, read the INSTALL file, build and install (sometimes after
fixing the source). I wasn’t interested in the implications of its
open source nature or the GPL licence. I also downloaded other
software. I did know the software was gratis, as opposed to
<link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSQL">MiniSQL/mSQL</link>
which was sourceware and shareware. That was good enough for me.
</para>
<para>
After I became more involved and started playing with Linux for
developing software on it, I learned even more and understood what
“free (as in speech) software” (or as it was later called
“open-source software”) was all about. One thing I understood back
then, was that it took me a long time to fully get to the bottom of
all the GPL’s nuances, and that I thought the public domain was
preferable, because I didn’t care too much about people changing the
licence to something else, or using it in their own
non-free/non-GPL-compatible software. A lot of people I have talked
with since have shown many misunderstandings of the GPL.
</para>
<para>
In any case, I had initiated some FOSS projects under the public-domain which
didn’t amount to a lot. I also wrote
<link xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/grad-fu/">a patch for
GIMP</link> which I made available, but has since then taken some other
iterations and incarnations to be embedded. And then I released
<link xlink:href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell
Solver</link> (originally under the Public Domain - now MIT/Expat)
and did a lot of extensive work on it, and then started some other
moderately successful MIT/Expat projects, or contributed to or
adopted FOSS projects under various licences.
</para>
<para>
So why am I still sticking with the MIT/Expat licence? The main
reason I think is that as an open-source programmer, I’m not
interested in worrying about how people abuse my code. I don’t like
Apple, and am not fond of many Microsoft products. But I’m not
interested to prevent Apple or Microsoft or any other developer of
commercial and/or proprietary software for Windows or Mac OS X or
the iPhone or whatever from using my code in their projects. In
fact, I would prefer them to use my code than to create a
proprietary replacement. Not to mention that making my code GPLed
may also make it inappropriate for reuse by some developers of BSD
software, for inclusion into the core BSD distributions, for some
developers of non-GPL-compatible-but-still-open-source software,
etc. I don’t want that - I want my code to be of the maximal use
possible.
</para>
<para>
I should note that I’m more worried about my code being used for
malicious purposes by evil governments, as I think no big
corporation in history has been as abusive as some past and present
governments that come to mind. But preventing internal use or
“defence use” or government use or whatever will make it non-FOSS,
(and non-GPL-compatible), not to mention that adding random
restrictions (“cannot be used by Neonazis”, “cannot be used by
terrorists”, “cannot be used by ‘Zionists’”, etc.) will fragment the
software licensing world as a whole, and I would prefer not to open
that Pandora Box.
</para>
<para>
Back to the topic: I don’t want to be bothered about legal issues
with my software. If you want to use my code - use it. “Drive
safely, the keys are inside.”. If you encounter any technical
problems with the code (bugs, documentation issues, etc.) then I’d
be interested to hear about them, because that will improve the
quality of the product, which will hopefully make it even more
successful. But I didn’t become a FOSS developer so I can sue people
for violating the licences of my works. I have better things to do
with my time, that bring me much more benefit.
</para>
<para>
Now, on to the issue of whether developing BSD-style code makes me a
“sucker”. I covered it earlier in
<link xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/open-source/gpl-bsd-and-suckerism/">“The
GPL, the BSD, and being a Sucker”</link> mini-essay.
</para>
<para>
To sum it up here, I don’t see why contributing to one’s neighbour
(or the public at large), willingly and on one’s free time (which
may be called “donation”, “philanthropy” or even “altruism”) and for
a non-harmful cause can be considered as being a “sucker”. Everybody
is able to use GPLed software of various originators too
free-of-charge or put it into good use in many legal and legitimate
ways and yet you don’t hear that often that people who develop GPLed
software are “suckers”.
</para>
<para>
I don’t see myself as a sucker just by allowing third-parties (whether
individuals, corporations, governments or any other organisations)
to use my software in non-free contexts, and don’t think anyone
should say that the GPL is the “don’t-be-a-sucker” licence because
BSD-style licences are by implications “be-a-sucker” licence. I hate
selfishness. (And I don’t mean “rational self-growth” or
acting-out-of-one’s-own-best-self-interest, which is what Ayn Rand
meant in the book
<link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virtue_of_Selfishness"><emphasis>The
Virtue of Selfishness</emphasis></link> - I discuss it in the link
briefly).
</para>
<para>
Another argument that you can often hear against the BSDL was that
the Linux kernel was more successful than the BSDs due to its GPLed
licence. However, this is:
</para>
<orderedlist spacing="compact">
<listitem>
<para>
A
<link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc">post-hoc
fallacy</link> - just because Linux is more successful than the
BSDs, doesn’t mean that the licence was the main reason for it,
or the only reason.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
In accordance to #1 - may be attributed to other factors such as
Linus Torvalds’ leadership skills, the kernel’s adoption of the
Bazaar-style of development, the willingness of Linux
distributions to use the GNU project’s software by default as
run-time, <link xlink:href="https://libquotes.com/linus-torvalds/quote/lbi7o4k">the cooler name</link>, the lack of initial legal limbo that
the BSDs had, etc. etc.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
One can find examples to projects in other niches that have been
very successful despite their permissive licences - Apache,
X-Windows, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Python, libxml2, OpenSSH, etc. So
extrapolating from one instance (the kernel) to everything is
not scientific.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The BSD-based kernels and operating systems are doing fine,
despite not being as popular as Linux. Often, people use code
from efforts by BSD developers in Linux (e.g: OpenSSH or some of
the OpenBSD wireless drivers that were adapted and integrated
into the Linux kernel). So it’s not as if, they have completely
“lost”.
</para>
</listitem>

</orderedlist>

<para>
While I’m still using GNU/Linux (Mandriva Linux Cooker in my case)
because that’s what I’ve grown accustomed to using, I would still
like to play with some BSD derivatives and OpenSolaris. I’m also not
planning on switching to gNewSense or one of the Free Software
Foundation’s endorsed “100% Free Distributions”, because Mandriva is
free enough for me.
</para>

<para>
To sum up, I’m not trying to dissuade you from licensing your
software under weak copyleft or strong copyleft licences, but I’m
still happy with my code being BSD-style. I’m glad to learn of any
use someone has been making of it, and in the few times it has been
used in commercial or proprietary contexts, it did not make me
regret that I released it as FOSS. I hadn’t wanted it to be an issue
in the first place, and so it wasn’t.
