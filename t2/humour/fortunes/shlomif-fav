Personally, I'd have a far better time writing scripts if I had some more
creative shells to script in...

ASMsh: The Assembly shell. Commands include MOV, SHL, SHR, JNE, etc.

shellTM: Turing machine shell. Only four commands. Read, write, move left,
move right. Capable of producing any programming language imaginable, given
enough time and nerves of steel.

GeneSH: Four commands. G, A, T, C. Need I say more?

Qsh: Only uses one environment variable, which contains all possible values
simultaneously. Method of scripting: isolate the universe in which the
desired result is already accomplished, and intersect with it.

Of course, I never said they'd be easy to use. But then, if these shells
existed, and I knew a sysadmin who used any of them, you can believe
Sysadmin Day would be a far more celebrated holiday.

The dictionary definition of capitalism is: An economic system characterized
by private ownership of capital goods and by investments that are determined
by private decision rather than by state control. Prices, production and
distribution of goods are determined by a free market. 

...

But most writers and commentators put dishonest altruistic-platonistic
connotations on the meaning of capitalism: A system of exploitation of the
weak by the strong -- devoid of love and good will. A system in which
unwanted goods and services are pushed onto consumers through clever,
deceptive advertising for the sole purpose of profits and greed. Capitalism
dominates most Western governments. Capitalism, big business, and fascism
are synonymous.

Yet, acting on fully integrated honesty (Neo-Tech), not reason itself, is
the basic moral act. When Genghis Khan, for example, chose to use reasoning
for a specific military move, then in an out-of-context sense, he chose to
act morally by protecting himself and his troops (thus filling human
biological needs). But in the larger sense of fully integrated honesty,
Khan's total actions were grossly immoral in choosing to use aggressive
force in becoming a mass murderer (thus negating human biological needs).
The highly destructive, irrational immorality of Genghis Khan's overall
dictatorial military actions far outweighed any narrow, out-of-context
"moral" actions. ...Genghis Khan was enormously evil as were Stalin, Hitler,
Mao, Castro, Pol Pot.

Why are there so many unmaintainable applications written in PHP and Perl?
Because PHP and Perl let undisciplined, inexperienced programmers write
useful code. So does Ruby -- but give it the popularity and longevity of PHP
and Perl (at least in English-speaking circles) and I bet you'll see plenty
of bad code written in Ruby too.

This seems like a variant of the Hackers and Painters fallacy. (Paul Graham
is rich. Paul Graham writes Lisp. Therefore everyone who writes Lisp will
get rich.) "All of the good, smart programmers I know are using Ruby. They
write good code. Therefore you can't write bad code in Ruby!"

It feels like there's another fallacy in there somewhere. I want to call it
the Pre-Post-Java Blindspot, where Java was the beginning of Serious
Programming Languages and only its successor will unseat it. (Like any good
fallacy, you have to ignore history, such as the fact that Ruby's between 10
and 12 years old.)

(I mean, if you really just can't read regular expressions, why not admit
it? You could start a twelve-step program or something.)

Much of the relative simplicity of Java is - like for most new languages -
partly an illusion and partly a function of its incompleteness. As time
passes, Java will grow significantly in size and complexity. It will double
or triple in size and grow implementation-dependent extensions or libraries.
That is the way every commercially successful language has developed. Just
look at any language you consider successful on a large scale. I know of no
exceptions, and there are good reasons for this phenomenon. [I wrote this
before 2000; now see a preview of Java 1.5 - http://xrl.us/kb3a ]

Although the contents of her book, The Virtue of Selfishness, are precisely
accurate and widely integrated, Ayn Rand committed an error by distorting the
word "selfishness" in fashioning a dramatic statement. The word "selfishness"
does have valuable, precise denotations of "an irrational, harmful disregard
for others". Rand could have strengthened her work by selecting accurate
wording such as rational self-growth. Instead, she unnecessarily bent and
undermined the precise, valuable meaning of selfishness. ...As with
selflessness, selfishness is a form of immature, destructive, irrational
behavior -- a form of stupid behavior.

It's one of those rare "perfect" kernels. So if it doesn't 
happen to compile with your config (or it does compile, but then does 
unspeakable acts of perversion with your pet dachshund), you can rest easy 
knowing that it's all your own d*mn fault, and you should just fix your 
evil ways.

You could send me and the kernel mailing list a note about it anyway, of 
course. (And perhaps pictures, if your dachshund is involved. Not that 
we'd be interested, of course. No. Just so that we'd know to avoid it next 
time).

In a widely anticipated move, Linux "headcase" Torvalds today announced
the immediate availability of the most advanced Linux kernel to date,
version 2.6.20.

Before downloading the actual new kernel, most avid kernel hackers have
been involved in a 2-hour pre-kernel-compilation count-down, with some
even spending the preceding week doing typing exercises and reciting PI
to a thousand decimal places.

The half-time entertainment is provided by randomly inserted trivial
syntax errors that nerds are expected to fix at home before completing
the compile, but most people actually seem to mostly enjoy watching the
compile warnings, sponsored by Anheuser-Busch, scroll past. 

As ICD head analyst Walter Dickweed put it: "Releasing a new kernel on
Superbowl Sunday means that the important 'pasty white nerd'
constituency finally has something to do while the rest of the country
sits comatose in front of their 65" plasma screens". 

Walter was immediately attacked for his racist and insensitive remarks
by Geeks without Borders representative Marilyn vos Savant, who pointed
out that not all of their members are either pasty nor white.  "Some of
them even shower!" she added, claiming that the constant stereotyping
hurts nerds' standing in society. 

Geeks outside the US were just confused about the whole issue, and were
heard wondering what the big hoopla was all about. Some of the more
culturally aware of them were heard snickering about balls that weren't
even round.

Slashdot Comment on Reasons to or not to use MySQL:
---------------------------------------------------

    A nice flame war. I'm just going to sit back, crack a beer and enjoy it. 
    It is almost memorial day weekend, you know. Hopefully it get hot enough 
    in here to roast a hot dog.

Oh goody! I'll help get things going:

* MySQL users will have to wait until you are done with the fire before they
can roast their hot dogs, since MySQL is not a real database and does not 
support concurrent roasting; 

* I've read the PostgreSQL manual eight times and still can't figure out 
something as bloody simple as roasting a hot dog, though I did figure out I 
have to call VACUUM before I can apply ketchup; 

* Serious enterprises who care about their hot dogs use Oracle, since you can
roast over 10,000 dogs at once and optionally impart the taste of filet mignon; 

* If you try to roast a footlong hotdog using MySQL it will silently truncate 
it to regular size, causing your child to cry;

* Oracle will sue you if you complain about the difficulty of starting your
* fire or the blackened taste of the dogs; 

* With SQLite your hot dogs are pre-roasted; 

* Last year on Memorial Day, mysqld leapt out of my MacBook Pro and pushed my
cousin into the fire, resulting in third degree burns. And also it causes
cancer. And terrorism. Blindness. Violent puppy death. BOO! MYSQL IS SCARY
DON'T USE MYSQL!!

Poetical sing-song or hypnotically rhythmic meter are often found in the
rhetoric of dictators, evangelists, sibyls, politicians, theologians,
mountebanks, social "intellectuals", media men, medicine men, hallucinating
psychotics, chanting shiites, and screaming terrorists. Consider how millions
of normally rational Germans thrilled and responded to the poetical cadence and
charisma of the consummate altruist neocheater, Adolph Hitler. The results: a
reign of destruction with tens of millions of human beings slaughtered so one
impotent man could indulge his mysticism to feel unearned power. All that
slaughter was for nothing more than to let one neocheater feel a pseudo
self-esteem. ...Twenty million dead so one pip-squeak could feel big and
important.

"So what!" cry the mystics as the lifetime efforts of a thousand productive,
innocent individuals are blown to bits every day without a backward glance. So
what if the troops roll across the country with military cadence and guns
ablaze. So what if they level town after town, reducing to rubble and corpses
all the values, beauty, and life that took generations of productive effort to
build.

And that is all the chanting religious automatons or splendid Panzer divisions
know how to do -- to destroy in a moment, without a thought, all the values
that producers labored for lifetimes to build. Chanting mobs or marching troops
never glance back, never think for a moment of the death and destruction they
leave behind. So what! the mystics and neocheaters cry. So what if genocide
happens in Russia, Nazi Germany, Cuba, Cambodia, Red China, or in our land. "I
don't want to hear it! To hell with the lifetime efforts of productive
individuals! ...Save the snail darter!"

Jesus, you da man! Stick it to those kids!
------------
You might be interested to note that the students had studied "Exodus 20:15 -
you shall not steal" which comes a little way before Jesus anyway. Wasn't the
whole point of Jesus coming to make the "new commandment" that people "love one
another as I have loved you" and to annul the previous commandments that were
given to Moses? I was raised Christian and was Christian for a long time but
now am not, but I can't quite remember the specifics of this point.

Anyway, the point is that Jesus probably would have told them to stick Exodus
to the man and just get on with the lovin'. Or something.

Apart from the fact that I congratulate you for writing bugless software
without peer review, I also congratulate you for being able to write a fully
RFC compliant MLM that won't blow up when you receive input you didn't account
for.

Quite frankly, even a crappy sysadmin can get a reasonable mailman setup
working (including nice archiving), quicker than the best coder can rewrite a
full MLM from scratch.  And you still have time left over to modify/fix/improve
mailman to do the few things it didn't do quite right for you.

But if your attitude to coding is "I'd rather rewrite all this than soiling my
eyes and hands looking at someone else's code", that's not a very good way to
get hired anywhere as a coder, and even if you are super brilliant, you end up
being a DJB that people snicker at with "that guy thinks he's so bright that he
had to write his own libc" (instead of fixing/wrapping the few problematic
pieces of them, and in the case of reasonable maintainers, contributing the
code back).

Among the generalists, the conventional wisdom is that the worse-is-better
approach is more adaptive. Personally, I get a little tired of the argument: My
worse-is-better is better than your worse-is-better because I'm better at being
worser! Is it really true that the worse-is-better approach always wins? With
Perl 6 we're trying to sneak one better-is-better cycle in there and hope to
come out ahead before reverting to the tried and true worse-is-better approach.
Whether that works, only time will tell.

If the bolt moves to Xeno, then it is proved that movement is possible. Also,

Are you saying that this linux can run on a computer without windows underneath
it, at all ? As in, without a boot disk, without any drivers, and without any
services ?

That sounds preposterous to me. 

If it were true (and I doubt it), then companies would be selling computers
without a windows. This clearly is not happening, so there must be some error
in your calculations. I hope you realise that windows is more than just Office
? Its a whole system that runs the computer from start to finish, and that is a
very difficult thing to acheive. A lot of people dont realise this.

Microsoft just spent $9 billion and many years to create Vista, so it does not
sound reasonable that some new alternative could just snap into existence
overnight like that. It would take billions of dollars and a massive effort to
achieve. IBM tried, and spent a huge amount of money developing OS/2 but could
never keep up with Windows. Apple tried to create their own system for years,
but finally gave up recently and moved to Intel and Microsoft. 

Its just not possible that a freeware like the Linux could be extended to the
point where it runs the entire computer fron start to finish, without using
some of the more critical parts of windows. Not possible.

I think you need to re-examine your assumptions.

Linux Genuine Advantage™ is an exciting and mandatory new way for you to place
your computer under the remote control of an untrusted third party! 

According to an independent study conducted by some scientists, many users of
Linux are running non-Genuine versions of their operating system. This puts
them at the disadvantage of having their computers work normally, without
periodically phoning home unannounced to see if it's OK for their computer to
continue functioning. These users are also missing out on the Advantage of
paying ongoing licensing fees to ensure their computer keeps operating
properly. 

To remedy this, we have created a new program available as a required free
download: Linux Genuine Advantage™!

Finally! Linux users can experience a feature that until now remained the
exclusive domain of proprietary software. 
   
Once you've installed Linux Genuine Advantage™, you'll want to register and
send in your licensing fees to receive these important benefits: 

* Your computer, which worked just fine before, will continue functioning 
normally!

* Our software which you just installed will not disable logins on your 
computer (as long as our license server keeps working properly)!

* It's totally awesome!  We might not raise the yearly licensing fees in the
future!

Plus, if you act now, we promise not to launch unfounded lawsuits against you,
slander you or our competitors in the press and the courts (possibly by using
other smaller companies as pawns), or require you to pay us for software you
won't use on every new computer you buy!

to license Linux Genuine Advantage™, we'd love to enter into a lucrative
licensing agreement. With the money you save, you could put the WGA programmers
onto other tasks, like improving Vista!

If you were a Unix programmer you either programmed in C or shell. And there
really wasn't much in between. There were these little languages that we used
on top of shell, but that was the big divide. The big revelation that hatched
Perl, as it were, was that this opened up into a two-dimensional space. And C
was good at something I like to call manipulexity, that is the manipulation of
complex things. While shell was good at something else which I call
whipuptitude, the aptitude for whipping things up.

So Perl was hatched. As a small egg. That was Perl 1. And it was designed from
the very beginning to evolve. The fact that we put sigils in front of the
variables meant that the namespaces were protected from new keywords. And that
was intentional, so we could evolve the language fairly rapidly without
impacting.

And it evolved... And it evolved... And finally we got to Perl 5. And... So...
Perhaps the Perl 6 slogan should be "All Your Paradigms Are Belong To Us".
We'll get to that.

    -- Larry Wall in http://xrl.us/bfpac

So I'd like to start off with my own irrationalities.

I don't think syntax should dangle in the wind. I'm with Aristotle. I think
things should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Which means I like K&R
bracketing. I do not like the way that Python hangs stuff out there, with no
end.

I think that ordinary people dislike abstraction. That's because I dislike
abstraction and I think I'm ordinary. (laughter) I might be wrong about that,
but I don't know.

I simultaneously believe that languages are wonderful and awful. You have to
hold both of those. Ugly things can be beautiful. And beautiful can get ugly
very fast. You know, take Lisp. You know, it's the most beautiful language in
the world. At least up until Haskell came along. (laughter) But, you know,
every program in Lisp is just ugly. I don't figure how that works.

I think visual metaphors are very important. How it looks. Different things
should look different. Similar things should look similar. A language designer
simultaneously has to care what other people think, and has to not care what
other people think. Otherwise you go crazy. Well, crazier. (laughter)

And finally, I think God has free will. And therefore he created programmers
with free will and that they ought to be given choices.

    -- Larry Wall in http://xrl.us/bfpac
%
Now, I'm not the only language designer with irrationalities. You can think of
some languages to go with some of these things.

* "We've got to start over from scratch" - Well, that's almost any academic
* language you find.
* "English phrases" - Well that's Cobol. You know, cargo cult English. 
(laughter)
* "Text processing doesn't matter much" - Fortran.
* "Simple languages produce simple solutions" - C.
* "If I wanted it fast, I'd write it in C" - That's almost a direct quote from 
the original awk page.
* "I thought of a way to do it so it must be right" - That's obviously PHP. 
(laughter and applause)
* "You can build anything with NAND gates" - Any language designed by an 
electrical engineer. (laughter)
* "This is a very high level language, who cares about bits?" - The entire 
scope of fourth generation languages fell into this... problem.
* "Users care about elegance" - A lot of languages from Europe tend to fall 
into this. You know, Eiffel.
* "The specification is good enough" - Ada.
* "Abstraction equals usability" - Scheme. Things like that.
* "The common kernel should be as small as possible" - Forth.
* "Let's make this easy for the computer" - Lisp. (laughter)
* "Most programs are designed top-down" - Pascal. (laughter)
* "Everything is a vector" - APL.
* "Everything is an object" - Smalltalk and its children. (whispered:) Ruby. 
(laughter)
* "Everything is a hypothesis" - Prolog. (laughter)
* "Everything is a function" - Haskell. (laughter)
* "Programmers should never have been given free will" - Obviously, Python. 
(laughter)

So my psychological conjecture is that normal people, if they perceive that a
computer language is forcing them to learn theory, they won't like it. In other
words, hide the fancy stuff. It can be there, just hide it.

Back to dimensionality. When you are saying something linguistically, it's like
taking a trip. You know, when you take a trip from California to Netanya, you
don't go straight south and then straight west and then straight north. It's
not orthogonal. There are little bits at the beginning. Then you take bigger
hops on the planes and then you take littler hops at the end. Language works
the same way, it's fractal. There is little orthogonality. At least apparently;
you can have orthogonal views of it, there are orthogonal subsets. But there
are multiple orthogonal subsets. At first glance it just looks like a network,
and you have to navigate the geography.

Now in terms of the anthropology we try to welcome people into the tribe. We
allow people to have their own little fiefdoms, where they are the ruler and
can beat up on their followers.

We try to let people share with each other. We try to capture knowledge. Both
of those things are why we have the CPAN, Comprehensive Perl Archive Network,
which is arguably one of the greatest repositories of reusable crappy software
in the world. (laughter).

And we have a culture of cooperating with other cultures too. We try to make
Parrot so that other languages can ran on top of that. We've always tried to
hook up Perl with everything. In kind of a humble sort of way. And finally it's
culture of fun. At least we try to make it that way. And that's why I give
weird talks.

The difference between a program and a script isn't as subtle as most people
think. A script is interpreted, and a program is compiled.

Of course, there's no reason you can't write a compiler that immediately
executes the compiled form of a program without writing compilation artifacts
to disk, but that's an implementation detail, and precision in technical
matters is important.

Though Perl 5, for example, doesn't write out the artifacts of compilation to
disk and Java and .Net do, Perl 5 is clearly an interpreter even though it
evaluates the compiled form of code in the same way that the JVM and the CLR
do. Why? Because it's a scripting language.
 
Okay, that's a facetious explanation.

The difference between a program and a script is if there's native compilation
available in at least one widely-used implementation. Thus Java before the
prevalence of even the HotSpot JVM and its JIT was a scripting language and now
it's a programming language, except that you can write a C interpreter that
doesn't have a JIT and C programs become scripts.
    -- chromatic in http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/journal/35804
%
Of course, if someone were to write an extra optimizer step for Perl 5 to
evaluate certain parts of the optree and generate native code in memory on
certain platforms without writing it out to disk (uh oh...) and then execute
that code under certain conditions, all Perl 5 scripts would automatically turn
into programs.  You know, like .pmc files, or Python's .pyc files. Uh.
 
As well, if more people use Punie (Perl 1 on Parrot) this year than native Perl
1 -- a possibility -- then Perl 1 scripts automatically become Perl 1 programs
becaues Punie can use Parrot's JIT. I don't know if this powerful upgrade from
script to program is retroactive, but I see no reason why not.

Perl 5 scripts were briefly programs while Ponie was viable, but the removal of
the code from the Parrot tree has now downgraded them back to scripts. We
apologize for the inconvenience.

    chromatic in http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/journal/35804
%
To summarize, if you have a separate compilation step visible to developers,
you have programs. If not, you have scripts. An exception is that if you have a
separate, partial compilation step at runtime and not visible to users, then
you may have programs. The presence of one implementation that performs
additional compilationy thingies at runtime instantly upgrades all scripts to
programs, while the presence of an interpreter for a language in which people
normally write programs, not scripts, does not downgrade programs to scripts.
Program-ness is sticky.

I hope this is now clear.

Ironically some JavaScript implementations have JITs, so the colloquial name of
the language should change from JavaScript to JavaProgram.

Script bad, four-legs good.

I have to say I cringed a little when I read it, because it helps  
reinforce the idea that there's a sort of Perl Hierarchy, or that  
there are Perl Gods, or that "you must be this tall to ride".

Randal and I are just normal ol' Perl hackers.  We just spend a lot of  
time on Perl, and writing about it, and talking about it.  The only  
reason we are Perl luminaries is that we are Perl luminaries.  I'm not  
necessarily a better programmer, or have better ideas, or I'm a better  
debugger than anyone else.  I just do it and make noise about it.

Even though Joey's response was out of line, I admire his spirit of  
"I'm just going to go do it."  TMTOWTDI is one of the cardinal rules  
of Perl.  Similarly, over on the module-authors list, the perennial  
argument of "Maybe CPAN should have minimum requirements for posting  
modules" has raised its ugly head.  Instead, I said what I always say  
during these arguments: "CPAN thrives BECAUSE of the unfettered  
uploading of shit, not in spite of it."

So to it will be with Joey's website.  Maybe it will be a dismal  
failure.  Maybe it will become the Next Great Perl resource.  However,  
I know that there is zero chance of Next Great Perl resource if he  
doesn't try.  The only way you get home runs is by stepping up to the  
plate, and if you strike out, you're doing pretty good.  Batting 3/10  
is a great batting average, but in real life we find those odds  
terrifying.

Personally, as much as I like the community around Perlmonks, I think  
it's a terrible site for new people, and is practically unsearchable.   
I'd love to see something leapfrog Perlmonks and become the Next Great  
Thing.  That's why I stopped writing to use.perl.org, because I think  
it's a terrible news source.  Instead, I started perlbuzz.com, and  
went with that.  Yes, it's different, but that's OK.

Let a thousand flowers bloom!
