    “Yes, but as they say: when it rains it pours. Well, just sign here and 
    I’ll take care of all the other paperwork.”

    After I started filling it, I said to him: “about the salary you 
    gave me...”

    “Forget it!” the commander said and continued “during your service in the
    Organisation, you’ve done a great service to your people and your country.
    You’ve earned your pay, even if not honestly, and we thank you that you’ve
    joined our ranks at all in the first place. I just hope that during your
    civil life, you’ll continue to maintain the spirit of the organisation and
    its philosophy.” 
    </p>

    “I’ll do my best, sir.” I told him with a snap while I signed it. Then I
    rose up and we shook hands. I thought a little about what the commander
    just said, and then recalled something and sat down. “Look, it may no
    longer be so relevant”, I said to him “but I’ve been a member of the
    Organisation for two years and nobody ever told me what the philosophy of
    the Organisation was. What is it, really?”

    <b>Israel is not all Desert</b>

    <p>
    While the southern part of Israel 
    (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev">the 
        Negev</a>) is a desert, most of the northern part has growth, and 
    supports a lot of trees, bushes, shrubs and fauna. There are
