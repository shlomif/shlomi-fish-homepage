          <saying who="Juerd">rbastic: JS on the client side is because often it's the only option the universe provides.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">Juerd: from a business perspective, you reduce the complexity and potential difficulties in finding new hires with the same skillset</saying>

          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: my translation to a sentence from the Tower of Babel myth.</saying>

          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: I was talking about the compilation speed of KDE apps and KDE itself.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: possibly because each file has half-a-gazillion headers.</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">My C++ code is a server one, so we don't have too many deps.</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">yeah, isn't there a way to cache header files? ie. in their "compiled" form?</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">or is that something I'm remembering from some other programming language that purported to build on top of C?</saying>

          <saying who="rbastic">i remember booting up the old app for the first time, and being amazed at how slow it was</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">eventually, i had to duplicate a feature in the Java code and i wasn't sure how it was implemented before</saying>
          <saying who="rindolf">rbastic: you mean the Java app is faster? :S</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">so being as i had no Delphi experience, and the newer Delphi environments made NO sense to me at all, i just opened up the SQL Server query analyzer</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">rindolf: yes, but only b/c the Delphi programmer was an idiot, issuing queries over and over again needlessly</saying>
          <saying who="rbastic">rindolf: if you could've seen the MSSQL Performance Analyzer or whatever, it was basically just.. Query1, Query2, Query3, Query1, Query2, Query3, repeat.</saying>

<saying who="ne2k__">yrlnry: not that it has anything to do with perl, but the &lt;input&gt; tag in HTML has both &quot;name&quot; and &quot;value&quot; attributes. the value is what gets shown in the browser typically.</saying>

<saying who="dazjorz">krang: depends on how seperated you want them to be</saying>
<saying who="krang">dazjorz: you mean just a line that has &quot;script.pl&quot;; written on it?</saying>
<saying who="Khisanth">you need the do as well</saying>
<saying who="dazjorz">krang: no, exactly this: do &quot;script.pl&quot;;</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">krang: system is usually what you want.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">krang: normally require or use are preferable to do</saying>
<saying who="dazjorz">rindolf: that&#39;s for modules, isn&#39;t it ?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dazjorz: yes.</saying>
<saying who="dazjorz">wait, I think require &quot;script.pl&quot; would work too</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dazjorz: and doing code is not such a good idea.</saying>
<saying who="dazjorz">rindolf: hmm?</saying>
<saying who="krang">rindolf: what is doing anyway?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dazjorz: I mean &quot;perldoc -f do&quot;-ing code.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">krang: do()-ing</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">krang: it reads the file and evaluates it.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">krang: perldoc -f do.</saying>
<saying who="dazjorz">rindolf: ah</saying>
<saying who="dazjorz">rindolf: do {}</saying>
<me_is who="rindolf">would rather be doing hot models than doing code. :-)</me_is>
<saying who="dazjorz">rindolf: yeah, do BLOCK is quite useless</saying>
<saying who="dazjorz">heh</saying>

<saying who="rindolf">If you want a configuration file, you should be using something like INI, YAML, etc.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">XML perhaps.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Something.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Apache-like config.</saying>
<saying who="dazjorz">Apache-like is very strong but hard to parse, right ?</saying>
<saying who="dazjorz">Loading and saving configuration never looks good, especially when it&#39;s XML</saying>

<saying who="jfroebe">trying to come up with a replacement name for my Flickr::Simple2.. (it is based off of XML::Simple rather than XML::Parser::Lite::Tree) - Net::Flickr, Flickr::API, Flickr::Simple are already taken.  Any ideas?  I&#39;m coming up blank for a name</saying>
<saying who="jfroebe">It is a Perl interface to Flickr</saying>
<saying who="mofino">wait</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">jfroebe: ah, I saw your message on Chicago.pm</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">jfroebe: maybe WWW::Flickr</saying>
<saying who="mofino">you found others and decided you needed to make ANOTHER perl interface to flickr?</saying>
<saying who="jfroebe">the other ones have been broken for a long time (either because of use of the abandoned XML::Parser::Lite::Tree module or because the authentication method was never correctly implemented)</saying>
<saying who="buu">jfroebe: Please no more names involving ::Simple</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">buu: ::Tiny</saying>
<saying who="jfroebe">WWW::Flickr is a good possibility</saying>
<saying who="buu">Thanks rindolf.</saying>
<saying who="mofino">hah tiny is the new simple</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">::Minimal.</saying>

<saying who="mofino">stay in the Flickr:: space</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">apeiron++</saying>
<saying who="mofino">if there already is one</saying>
<saying who="jfroebe">mofino.. that&#39;s the problem what to name it</saying>
<saying who="nadim">::Nano</saying>
<saying who="nadim">that should be small enough and it sounds serious</saying>
<saying who="mofino">jfroebe, something in Flickr:: ;)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">::Femto</saying>
<saying who="jfroebe">lol - understood</saying>
<saying who="mofino">jfroebe, ::Improved ::Modern ::Lite ::Tiny ::FUCKYEAH</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">jfroebe: a Rose by any other name...</saying>
<saying who="mofino">IS A DUCK</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">I think half the posts to module-authors are about &quot;How shall I name this module?&quot;</saying>
<saying who="mofino">haha</saying>
<saying who="ik">I use perlmonks for that ^_^</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">jfroebe: I&#39;m not a fan of XML::Simple either.</saying>
<saying who="mofino">XML::Simple is teh awesome</saying>
<saying who="ik">1;</saying>
<saying who="ik">XML::Simple is teh sux</saying>
<saying who="mofino">whatever</saying>
<saying who="ik">&quot;this could be an arrayref or a hashref or a nothingref depending on how many thingies were in your doo-dad&quot;</saying>
<saying who="mofino">force it</saying>
<saying who="ik">yes</saying>
<saying who="mofino">but yeah, that is a bit annoying</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">ik++ - my thoughts exactly.</saying>
<saying who="mofino">OH SUDDEN HASHREF</saying>
<saying who="apeiron">XML::Simple is the MySQL of XML parsers.</saying>
<saying who="mofino">haha</saying>
<saying who="mofino">ahh mysql, DOOOMED</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Haha # apeiron++</saying>
<saying who="kent\n">lol @ &gt; apeiron</saying>
<saying who="drforr">There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s called &quot;Simple.&quot; You&#39;ll find out about 3 days after you start using it.</saying>
<saying who="kent\n">would it be anything releated to being feature-incomplete</saying>
<saying who="drforr">That would be be why it&#39;s &quot;simple&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="jfroebe"> but for simple XML data (i.e. Flickr&#39;s REST API), it is more than sufficient</saying>
<saying who="kent\n">define &quot;simple&quot; XML</saying>

<saying who="mofino">oh, nevermind</saying>
<saying who="jfroebe">mofino - now you see.. all the good ones are taken ;-)</saying>
<saying who="mofino">maybe you had it at Flickr::Simple2</saying>
<saying who="kent\n">Flickr::API:: something</saying>
<saying who="kent\n">or something</saying>
<saying who="mofino">kent\n, namespace already in use</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Flickr::Two</saying>
<saying who="mofino">jfroebe, since your API is an improvement over Simple</saying>
<saying who="nadim">mst: lol</saying>
<saying who="kent\n">Flickr::API::SucksLess</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">jfroebe: you can call it Flickr::Jfroebey</saying>
<saying who="jfroebe">mofino, I think you might be right.</saying>
<saying who="kent\n">Flicker::API::FAFINAFA</saying>
<saying who="jfroebe">rindolf - lol ... my head is already big enough lol</saying>
<saying who="mofino">jfroebe, i mean, if that&#39;s what it is, it shows a clear progression from Simple</saying>
<saying who="kent\n">( Flicker::API::FAFINAFA is not a flickr api )</saying>
<saying who="nadim">Flicker::rekcilF</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">jfroebe: I have released Spork::Shlomify with some random changes to Spork that I needed.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">Well, I use subclassing to implement them.</saying>
<saying who="jfroebe">lmao</saying>
<saying who="apeiron">You forked that spork!</saying>

<saying who="perlygatekeeper">hmmm</saying>

<saying who="perlygatekeeper">you?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlygatekeeper: fine. Let me recall what I said to ezra.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlygatekeeper: I&#39;m fine. Got into a few flamewars, and escaped alive to tell the tale.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlygatekeeper: worked a bit on my story &quot;The Human Hacking Field Guide&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlygatekeeper: (which, BTW, you appear there (as your IRC nick at least)</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlygatekeeper: and now working on the Computer Graphics section of my homepage.</saying>
<saying who="perlygatekeeper">rindolf, what the hell?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlygatekeeper: excuse me?</saying>
<saying who="perlygatekeeper">rindolf was that someone pretending to be me?</saying>
<saying who="perlygatekeeper">I never said those things</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlygatekeeper: it&#39;s a fictitious story.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">perlygatekeeper: relax.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">perlygatekeeper: or you could be the imposter right now... or maybe just schizophrenic.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: MPDed not schizophrenic.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: schizophrenia is not Multi-Persona-Disordered.</saying>
<saying who="b0at">perlygatekeeper: It&#39;s fan fiction from your fan!</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">rindolf: what&#39;s the difference?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: MPD is when there are several personalities living inside your brain.</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: in schizophrenia, you have one I-ness, but hear voices, hallucinate and stuff.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">rindolf: Ah. Why is it considered a disorder? MPD could be quite useful... One would have different perspectives on a subject.</saying>
<saying who="perlygatekeeper">where&#39;s beth, she&#39;ll know it&#39;s me</saying>
<saying who="integral">But how will we know it&#39;s beth?!</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">rindolf: Oh, I have MPD then, not schizophrenia. I don&#39;t hallucinate.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">integral: WE DON&#39;T!</saying>
<saying who="b0at">I don&#39;t hallucinate, but my other personality does.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">How do I know all of you exist? Am I just a figment of my own imagination?</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">b0at: Interesting...</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: Julian Jaynes describes schizophrenia very well in his &quot;The Origins of Consciousness during the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind book&quot;.</saying>
<saying who="integral">nono, you&#39;re all just figments of _lilo_&#39;s imagination</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">rindolf: I&#39;ll check it out</saying>
<saying who="b0at">he wishes</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">integral: and you?</saying>
<saying who="perlygatekeeper">the voices tell me if it&#39;s really beth or not</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">perlygatekeeper: The voices tell me everything.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">Wait, I do have the Voices. Maybe I have MPD _and_ schizophrenia.</saying>
<saying who="b0at">Ah, but the question is: do the Voices have voices?</saying>
<saying who="rindolf">dabreegster: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Consciousness_in_the_Breakdown_of_the_Bicameral_Mind</saying>
<saying who="b0at">And if so, is it your own voice?</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">b0at: And do the voices of the voices have voices?</saying>
<saying who="b0at">That&#39;s just going too far.</saying>
<saying who="dkr">don&#39;t worry, those are angels, invest in tarot cards and you will be able to understand them</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">b0at: and if it&#39;s not, then could it be the voice of........ integral? rindolf? or.... buu!</saying>
<saying who="b0at">buu has other plans for our empty skulls</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">b0at: and if they do, then what do the voices of the voices of the voices of the Voices sound like?</saying>
<saying who="integral">*sob* it&#39;s the cabbages.   The cabbages keep telling me to do things</saying>
<saying who="Botje">really? most of the time it&#39;s the socks that tell me stuff</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">integral: The lawn gnomes tell me. They&#39;re........everywhere...*sniffle*</saying>
<saying who="integral">*blubber* the socks are worse, there&#39;s moths living in them</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">The lawn gnomes tell me to stay away from Life. They force me to write poetry.</saying>
<saying who="dabreegster">integral: *whispering* are the _moths_ the Voices? or the voices of the Voices? or the voices of the voices of the Voices?</saying>
