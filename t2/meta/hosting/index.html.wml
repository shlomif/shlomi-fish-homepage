<latemp_subject "About this Site's Hosting" />

<h2 id="eonspace">Eonspace</h2>

<p>
This site is hosted at <a href="http://eonspace.net/"><b>eonspace.net</b></a>.
There's very little on the web-page, because eonspace.net is an Israeli
operation of one or two people, which finds most of its customers using
word-of-mouth.
</p>

<p>
As a general rule, I'm happy with the hosting. While there had been
a few outages (possibly because of the ISP's fault), one of the advantages
is that I can always reach my hostmaster by phone when I encounter a problem.
I'm getting shell access with Perl, PHP, and most other services, and pay a
relatively low yearly fee. At the moment, most of my site is just plain-HTML.
</p>

<p>
If you're interested to be hosted in Eonspace, 
<a href="$(ROOT)/me/contact-me/">drop me a line</a>, and I'll give you my
hostmaster's contact information.

server hosting</a> for example - then have a look at our long term buddies:
