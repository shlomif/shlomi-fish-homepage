<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/site-source/">The build instructions
    for the main www.shlomifish.org site</a> are now operational again after
a long time when they were out-of-date. Part of the reason why they
were not kept out of date was that the public sources of the site have grown
out-of-date from those stored in my local copy. This 
<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/22272.html">was
    recently fixed</a> with some kind insights and guidance by 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~mstrout/">Matt S. Trout</a>. Since I promised
50 U.S. Dollars to the first person that will help me fix my source control 
problems, and Matt provided all the help I ended up needing, I will donate 
them on his behalf to <a href="http://www.enlightenedperl.org/">the
    Englightened Perl Organisation</a>. Many thanks!
</p>

<p>
And here are the rest of the changes in the site's content that took place since
the last update - for those who are not only interested in building it.
</p>

<p>
There are <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#God_gave_us_two_eyes">two new bits in the collection of Aphorisms</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    God gave us two eyes and ten fingers so we will type five times as much as we read.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/File-Find-Object/">The File-Find-Object homepage</a> was updated with more text.
</p>

<p>
There are new links in <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/">the
    against bad software pages</a>.
</p>

<p>
A lot of broken HTML and XHTML in the site was fixed, and all the pages were
made to validate.
</p>

<p>
New <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">Fortune Cookies 
    were added</a> and existing ones were fixed (and there are some more in 
the pipe):
