Subject: Perl 'Expert' Quiz-of-the-Week #2


The local high school baseball team, the Randal Schwartz High School
Phoenixes, will be playing a series of games against their rivals, the
Richard M. Nixon Memorial High School Growlin' Fungus.  The series
lasts at most five games, and ends when one team has won three games.
You want to bet $80 on the Phoenixes to win the series, but your
bookie will only take bets on individual games.  (The bookie pays even
money on all bets.)

A mathematically-inclined friend solves the problem for you, giving
you the following instructions:

  Bet $30 on each of the first two games.

  Bet $20 on the third game if either team has won both of the first two
  games, $40 otherwise.

  Bet $40 on the fourth game, if there is one.
  Bet $80 on the fifth game, if there is one.

  At the end of the series, you will be ahead by exactly $80 if the
  Fightin' Quakers have won the series, and behind by exactly $80 if
  the Sewer Fungus have won.

We could summarize the instructions in a table like this:

        If the game score is:
           0 to 0, bet $30
           1 to 0, bet  30
           1 to 1, bet  40
           2 to 0, bet  20
           2 to 1, bet  40
           2 to 2, bet  80

Write a function which calculates the appropriate bet for any such
contest, given the total amount you want to risk on the series, the
length of the series, and the current game score.  For example,

        bet(80, 5, 2, 1)

should return 40, because if you want to risk $80 on a 5-game
series, and one team is presently ahead 2 games to 1, you should bet
$40.  

Similarly 

        bet(1000, 7, 2, 1)

should return 375.  

(That is, if you're trying to bet $1000 on the current World Series
baseball match, you need to bet $375 on the outcome of tonight's game.
If you started with $1000, and followed this function's advice, you'd
have $625 left if you had been betting on the Giants and $1375 if you
had been betting on the Angels.  For people living in places where the
World Series is irrelevant: the match is a best-four-of-seven series
of games; at present, the Anaheim Angels are beating the San Francisco
Giants two games to one, with the fourth game scheduled for tonight.)

The same notes as last week; read them *all* if you didn't read them
last week:

 * I'll post an example solution here on Monday.

 * perl-qotw will only carry the quizzes and solutions.  Discussion,
   remarks, comments, and soforth should go to
   perl-qotw-discuss@plover.com.  To subscribe to that list, send mail
   to perl-qotw-discuss-subscribe@plover.com.

 * I'd like to request that nobody post any sample solutions or other
   spoilers to the discussion list until at least Saturday.

 * Even after Saturday, any solutions or other spoilers should always
   be marked with the word SPOILER in the subject line, so that other
   people won't see them by accident.

 * If you'd like to contribute a quiz question, send it to me.

Thanks.
