</li>
<li>
It is a command line debugger.
</li>
<li>
<b>In order to use gdb one must use the -g flag when compiling!</b>
</li>
<li>
Executing gdb is simple:  <tt>gdb program_name</tt>. 
</li>
<li>
gdb has an excellent built in help, you can type <tt>help</tt> from the
gdb command line and get a list of stuff to get help on, or type 
<tt>help &lt;something&gt;</tt>, and get specific help on something - either 
a command or a topic name.

Other good sources for help on gdb are

gdb manual</a> and
