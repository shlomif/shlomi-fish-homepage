<p>
The <tt>for</tt> keyword in Perl means exactly the same as <tt>foreach</tt> and
you can use either one interchangeably.

<p>
<tt>$a .. $b</tt> is a special operator that returns an array containing the
sequence of consecutive integers from <tt>$a</tt> up to and including
<tt>$b</tt>. Now one can fully understand the <tt>for $i (1 .. 10)</tt>
construct that we used in the beginning of this lecture.
