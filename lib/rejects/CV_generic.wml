MikMod for Java (an independent project)<br />
Programmer<br />
<br />
Converting a program from ANSI C to Java<br />
<br />
Mod Files are music files whose instruments are given as samples, and are
played at different notes and effects to create the melody. The conversion
was done by converting to C++, and then several steps of Javaization. The
resultant code was working and produced good output, but was not very conformant
to the Java style.

Smart Link Ltd.<br />
Programmer and Tester<br />
<br />
Testing a software-based modem (Modio), Windows 95 Programming<br />
<br />
<p>
I began working at Smart-Link as a tester for their software-based modem
which was based on a soundcare and implemented the connection logic and the DSP
in software. I worked with Windows 95 and Windows 95 OSR2. When Smart-Link hired
a dedicated and more experienced Q&amp;A Engineer, I became a part-time tester/
high-level programmer/general jack-of-all-trades.
</p>

<p>
I worked with the Windows Drivers, MFC, Perl for Win32, DJGPP, Cygwin, a myriad
of games and modem-related software, as well as Microsoft IIS.

<br />

<p>
I worked in Cortext as a web-designer and CGI programmer. I worked with HTML,
Apache, Perl, various UNIX flavours (FreeBSD, SunOS 4.1.3, IRIX) and Windows
95 Workstations. Built several sites there, while still using almost exclusively
Perl due to my limited knowledge (at that point) of UNIX.

Elpas Electro-optic Systems, Ltd.<br />
Chief Programmer of EIRIS (Elpas Infra-Red Identification System)<br />
<br />
Databases, client/server programs (with NetDDE), English/Hebrew
MS-Windows GUI<br />
<br />
<p>
Elpas manufactured a network of sensors that was installed in each room
of a building (say a hospital), received input from infra-red badges, that made
it possible to determine where each person or piece of equipment was located. I
maintained the software that run on a centralized computer, received the raw
input from the sensors and processed it. My main issue was to replace an SCO
UNIX server software with something internal of out own. We inspected working
with Microsoft Access and ODBC, and eventually realized our own in-memory data
managing was the most suitable solution due to the real-time nature of the application.
</p>
<p>
Specialized in Windows (16-bit) Programming, SQL, ODBC, ANSI C and C++. Worked
primarily with Borland C++ 4.5 and the Microsoft Developer Network CD.
