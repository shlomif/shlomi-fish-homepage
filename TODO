* Fortunes Atom Feed:
    - Make it validate
    - Syndicate it into the rest.
    - fix the formatting of the fortunes (especially IRC fortunes) in 
    Akregator.

* Update the instructions for how to build the homepage:
    - projectlocker.

* Integrate building the lectures/presentations into the homepage.

* Convert the CSS away from TTML and into a script that will process
them using an explicit call to Template Toolkit.

* Convert the gvimisation of the source code in the quad-pres presentations
to the Lambda Calculus lecture's CPAN module.

* Fortunes pages: link to the XML and plain-text files.

* Upload the non-Quad-Pres presentations source.

* Add the "Escape from GNU Autohell" page.

* Add the "Editors and IDEs" software resources page.

* Add the "Don't abuse JavaScript" page:
    - Hall of Shame:
        - Amarok 2.x
        - GNOME 3.0.
    - "JavaScript: The Good Parts" Google Tech Talk video.
        - more accurately "JS: The Bad Parts"
    - JS has no sprintf.
    - JS has no date formatting.
    - JS has no sort.
    - "var" is optional.
    - the new JavaScript standard presentation on Google Tech Talk.
        - many JS shortcoming.
    - JS's foreach loop loops over indices instead of the array's contents.

Minor Problems:
---------------

* Fix the fact that the "Private Tutor HTML Ad" goes beyond the right 
margins.

* Go over the pages of the individual presentations and add meaningful 
descriptions.
    - link to the new presentation in "Linux for the Technion student".

* Add to the external FOSS contributions:
    - MikMod
    - Adopted CPAN Modules
    - Wikipedia and related sites.

* Investigate the following subversion scenario:
    - svn rm myfile.
    - svn cp ../../IP/myfile myfile.
    - svn revert -R .
    - change myfile.
    - commit.

Long Term:
----------

* Add more software packages to the numerical software page.

* Add more essays I wrote to the Essays Index.

* Revamp the Math-Ventures site and re-write the formulae in TeX, MathML 
etc.

* Put more meaningful descriptions in the place holders for all the
presentations.

* Style the .prod_set's on the CD recommendations page.

* Style the section navigation menus better.

    - Book recommendations.
    - Music recommendations.

* Distribute the links under t2/links.html into relevant pages on the site,
possibly using lib/article-index/article-index.xsl.
