<p>
<b>1 April, 2011, Tel Aviv, Israel:</b>
Freecell Solver Enterprises™, Inc., on behalf of the
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver™</a> development
team, is glad to announce the upcoming availability of the
Webscale™ Edition of Freecell Solver™, the solver for various types of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience_%28game%29">Patience
    games</a>.
</p>

<p>
Freecell Solver™, has until now made use of a compile-time choice of primitive,
in-memory, data-structures such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash tables</a>
or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree">self-balancing
    binary trees</a>, but now we decided that it's time to move on to something
more in the spirit of 2010s. Since SQL databases have already become passé,
we decided to skip directly to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a> trend of databases
(also known as "Oh no! No SQL!") and to write alternative backends for
Freecell Solver™ for distributed NoSQL stores such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra_%28database%29">Cassandra</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB">MongoDB</a>,
or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchDB">CouchDB</a>.
</p>

<p>
Freecell Solver Enterprises™ is certain that using these modern,
high-performance, and highly distributed stores will increase
Freecell Solver™'s webscalability, and allow it to process a larger amount of
stored positions than it could at the moment at a far greater speed
and make Freecell Solver™ be ready for the cloud. As our CTO, Shlomi Fish,
says “If you're not excited about it now, you should be.”
</p>

<p>
Expect the upcoming availability of Freecell Solver™ Webscale™ Edition from
the <a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">homepage</a> of Freecell Solver™.

Well /dev/null is not quite webscale, but it's high time we

it so</a>.
