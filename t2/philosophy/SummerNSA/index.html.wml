<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
The #SummerNSA effort has its origins in
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=smg-next-film">an
email exchange</a> from around ~1998 and has acquired much more momentum
much later with the publication of
<a href="$(ROOT)/humour/bits/facts/NSA/">NSA facts</a>
and the <a href="$(ROOT)/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/">Summerschool
at the NSA</a> screenplay which features the Hollywood actresses
Sarah Michelle Gellar and Summer Glau as themselves.
