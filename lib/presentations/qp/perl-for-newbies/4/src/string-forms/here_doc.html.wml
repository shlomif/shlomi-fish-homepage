<p>
In a here document, one specifies an ending string to end the string
on a separate line, and between it, one can place any string he wishes.
This is useful if your string contains a lot of irregular characters.
</p>

<p>
The syntax for a here document is a <code>&lt;&lt;</code> followed by
the string ending sequence, followed by the end of the statement. In
the lines afterwards, one places the string itself followed by its
ending sequence.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example:
</p>


<quadpres_code_file filename="src/string-forms/here-doc.pl" />

<p>
Its output is:
</p>


<quadpres_code_block>
The value of $x is: "Hello"
The value of $str is: "There you go."
The value of true is: "False"

Hoola


</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
Note that if the delimeters on the terminator after the <code>&lt;&lt;</code>
are double-quotes (<code>"..."</code>), then the here-document will interpolate,
and if they are single-quotes (<code>'...'</code>), it will not.
</p>

<p>
An unquoted ending string causes the here-doc to interpolate, in case
you encounter it in the wild. Note however, that in your code, you should
always quote it, so people won't have to guess what you meant.
