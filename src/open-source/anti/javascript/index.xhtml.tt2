<p>
JavaScript has become popular due to being useful for scripting browsers,
which is an acceptable use, due to the fact that it is the only
commonly-acceptable portable choice for that. However, lately, it has been
utilised as a host language for many other realms where there are far saner and
superior alternatives.
</p>

<p>
This page aims to explain why JavaScript should not be abused for such uses.

Whether any existing language could be used, instead of inventing a new one,
was also not something I decided. The diktat from upper engineering management
was that the language must “look like Java”. That ruled out Perl, Python, and
Tcl, along with Scheme. Later, in 1996, John Ousterhout came by to pitch Tk and
lament the missed opportunity for Tcl.

Ok, back to JavaScript popularity. We know certain Ajax libraries are popular.
Is JavaScript popular? It’s hard to say. Some Ajax developers profess (and
demonstrate) love for it. Yet many curse it, including me. I still think of it
as a quickie love-child of C and Self. Dr. Johnson’s words come to mind:
“the part that is good is not original, and the part that is original is not
good.”
