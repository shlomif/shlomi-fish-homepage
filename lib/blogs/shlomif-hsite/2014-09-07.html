<h2>The Muppet Show - The Next Incarnation ; </h2>

<!-- Tags: open, humour, humor, stories, screenplays, facts, chuck norris

<p>
Here are the recent updates for <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi
Fish’s Homepage</a>.

<li>
<p>
The set of screenplays
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/">“The Muppet Show:
The Next Incarnation”</a> is me taking the initiative for writing screenplays
for a new incarnation of The Muppet Show. Currently, there’s a mostly
complete <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Summer-Glau-and-Chuck-Norris.html">episode</a>
with Chuck Norris and Summer Glau as two ruthless Grammar Nazis,
another incomplete
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Harry-Potter.html">episode</a>
hosting some of the characters of Harry Potter,
and a preliminary-stages
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Jennifer-Lawrence.html">episode</a>
with Jennifer Lawrence (crossing Silver Linings Playbook, The Hunger Games,
and her personal life).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>“Meet Chuck”</b></p>
<p>
[
The Muppet Show Theatre backstage. Kermit and Fozzy are there.
</p>
<p>ChuckN (= Chuck Norris) enters through the door.

]
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Kermit:</strong> Oh hello, Mr. Norris. We’re so glad
to have you here, and we would
love to learn more about you.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">ChuckN:</strong> Thank you, Kermit. You can learn more about me from my 500-page
autobiography, which took me an hour to write, and from the comprehensive
book of Factoids about me, of which I wrote every one.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Fozzy:</strong> Funny! Funny!
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">ChuckN:</strong> Indeed. Anyway, I invited a friend of mine, who is even crazier than I
am, to join us.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Kermit:</strong> Really, who is this crazy guy?
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">ChuckN:</strong> Actually, it’s a crazy girl.
</p>
<p>
[
    SGlau (= Summer Glau) jumps from above the frame to the upper row and then down to where
    Kermit and Fozzy are standing. Applause. She is wearing a grey, military-like
    vest with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper">zipper</a> at
    the front.
]
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Kermit:</strong> Oh, nice to see you here, Ms. Glau.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Shut up, Mr. Frog! I’m here on a mission from the Grammar God. Herr
Norris and I are loyal servants of Grammar Nazism, which aims to unite Grammar
Europe under the reign of the Third Grammar Reich.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">ChuckN and SGlau:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[in unison]</span> Hail Grammar!
</p>
<p>
[
    Miss Piggy is walking on the upper row with a fellow pig.
]
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Miss Piggy:</strong> Well, I don’t think that Miss Mousy is prettier than me.
</p>
<p>
[
    A shot sounds and Miss Piggy's hat is blown away. Cut to SGlau who is
    holding a gun in her left hand.
]
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> That was a warning shot, Fräulein Piggy. For your information, it should
be “is prettier than <strong class="bold">I</strong>”.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">ChuckN and SGlau:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[in unison]</span> Hail Grammar!
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Let’s go.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> By the way, herr Frog: it is not that hard to be green.
</p>
<p>
[
    They go out of the frame.
]
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Kermit:</strong> Meep. I have a bad feeling about all that.

There are several

aphorisms</a> (some along with captioned images) in the Aphorisms and
Quotes page. One of them is «A woman is a lady even if she is or was a porn
actress or a prostitute. Treat her with respect, be honest to her — be a
gentleman.», which is <a

<li>
<p>
There are new humorous facts in the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/">collection of factoids</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
Emma Watson does not have 10 years of experience in developing Enterprise
Java software. However, she has over 10 years of experience in getting shit
done - well, on schedule, and at a reasonable cost.

<li>
<p>
Chuck Norris has 99 problems including a bitch. Summer Glau has exactly 98
problems.

<li>
<p>
Xena the Warrior Princess has not met Chuck Norris yet, or otherwise he
would have been badly and permanently injured.

          <li><b>thecha:</b> not much. I am running my trisquel gnu/linux from an usb now</li>

          <li><b>thecha:</b> and you?</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> thecha: I've been redditting and twittering.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> thecha: and I went on a walk now.</li>

          <li><b>pulse:</b> hi rindolf</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> thecha: I met a father with two children. he scolded them.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> thecha: I asked him for their names and he said "why does it matter?" :-(</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> pulse: hi.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> I also saw a lady sitting on a bench with two Pekinese dogs - one male and one female.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> they barked at me.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> Maybe she was afraid of me (their owner I mean).</li>

          <li><b>ezrios:</b> dogs bark at everything</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> I also saw some bird watchers in the park earlier in the morning.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> ezrios: some dogs are amazingly calm.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> ezrios: I once met a huge Caucasian Shepherd dog who was less than one years old and called "Rambo" who was super-calm.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> His owner was also very friendly.</li>

          <li><b>ezrios:</b> a super-calm Rambo eh</li>

          <li><b>epitamizor:</b> cool story bro</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> They say the dog and its owner resemble each other.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> epitamizor: every story is cool with the right attitude.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> epitamizor: http://www.reddit.com/r/TMNT/comments/2d9fo7/postrelease_movie_discussion_thread_2/ck3khga - see this.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> ezrios: yes , amazing.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> ezrios: Rambo was the epitome of a tough all powerful super-muscular anti-geeky warrior/action-hero.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> ezrios: but the fact of the matter is that the best combat warriors in the world are: 1. Not very muscular. 2. Geeks.</li>

          <li><b>thecha:</b> ok i will try</li>

          <li><b>thecha:</b> the dog probably ws being agressive because the owners mood was affecting him</li>

          <li><b>thecha:</b> the owner probably was being hostile so the dog followed suit</li>

          <li><b>thecha:</b> and the guy with the kids should have just said the names isntead of being a dick about it</li>

          <li><b>thecha:</b> you go for walks often?</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> thecha: yes, I go for walks a lot.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> thecha: yes, this father should learn some things after fatherhood.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> thecha: the children were nice.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> Oh! and on the way upstairs there was a very young boy with a toy gun and I pretended to wage an imaginary war with him. He enjoyed it.</li>

          <li><b>thecha:</b> rindolf-&gt; who won the imaginary shoot out?</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> thecha: he did I think.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> thecha: I let him win.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> thecha: he seemed to have enjoyed it.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> thecha: children can be so smart.</li>

          <li><b>pulse:</b> i don't think age has anything to do with smartness</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> thecha: and it helped brighten my day.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> pulse: yes.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> pulse: I have actually grown smarter with age.</li>

          <li><b>pulse:</b> i've grown wiser. not much smarter</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> pulse: ah.</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> pulse: what's your distinction?</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> pulse: I've grown wiser too.</li>

          <li><b>pulse:</b> smart is the ability to calculate things fast</li>

          <li><b>pulse:</b> wise is the ability to live your life ;)</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> pulse: there are more parameters to intelligence than doing fast calculations.</li>

          <li><b>pulse:</b> i guess there's certain correlation between the two</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> pulse: yes.</li>

          <li><b>pulse:</b> i know. there's different types of intelligence</li>

          <li><b>pulse:</b> but most types boil down to two things. calculations and speed</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> pulse: ah. IQ?</li>

          <li><b>pulse:</b> any kind of intelligence</li>

          <li><b>pulse:</b> IQ is a sort of generalization of all types</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> pulse: see https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/495252148775436288 - «Forget #IQ! #Sloppy → #Confident → #Smart!! #TeamGrimmie #confidence #competence #PublishOrPerish»</li>

          <li><b>pulse:</b> but it's also stupid</li>

          <li><b>pulse:</b> rindolf, hmm</li>

          <li><b>pulse:</b> what am i supposed to see there :P</li>

          <li><b>pulse:</b> i still don't know how twitter works</li>

          <li><b>pulse:</b> what are those hashtags supposed to be</li>

          <li><b>pyon:</b> rindolf: Meh, sloppiness is just sloppiness.</li>

          <li><b>pyon:</b> rindolf: One can be flexible without lowering one's own standards.</li>

          <li><b>thecha:</b> rindolf you can't let the enemy win</li>

          <li><b>rindolf:</b> thecha: yes, bring the Delta Team with Chuck Norris, Sylvester Stalone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and.. Summer Glau (!♥:-)) against this boy.</li>

of those battles.

</p>
              <p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> Buffy Summers is not afraid of demons. Demons are afraid of her, and
for a very good reason.
</p>
              <p><strong class="sayer">Buffy’s voice:</strong> Buffy Summers is always there when people are spreading
untrue hyperboles about her.

              <p><strong class="sayer">Buffy:</strong> It’s “Summers”. Angel and I are both called that. He didn’t find his
original family name usable in this day and age, so he adopted mine. His
original name was very aristocratic, and he is actually a direct male

              <p><strong class="sayer">Buffy:</strong> In any case, for your information, I fought against Chuck Norris several
times and lost all the battles. In fact, that was part of the catalyst that
made us realise that slayers were only humans and that men can be equally as
capable slayers as women. You will hopefully get a chance to meet and even
fight against Mr. Norris sometime throughout the school year.
