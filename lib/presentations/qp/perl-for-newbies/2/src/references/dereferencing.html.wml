<p>
The entire scalar or data structure pointed to by the reference can be
retrieved by dereferncing. Dereferencing is done by using a <tt>$</tt>,
a <tt>@</tt> or a <tt>%</tt> (depending if the reference refers to a scalar
, array or a hash respectively), and then the reference inside curly braces.

<p>
Here are some simple examples:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/references/deref1.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
If the expression that yields the reference is a simple one than the curly
brackets can be omitted (e.g: <tt>@$array_ref</tt> or <tt>$$ref</tt>).
However, assuming you use curly brackets - the expression surrounded
inside them can be as complex as you would like.
