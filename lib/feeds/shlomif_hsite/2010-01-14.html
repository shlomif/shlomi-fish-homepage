<!-- TITLE=New Programs, New Fortunes, and a New Revision of “The Case for Drug Legalisation”-->
<p>
I added the <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/puzzles/maths/n5-riddle/" rel="nofollow">5^n
    riddle page</a> to the <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/puzzles/" rel="nofollow">puzzles section</a>.
</p>

<p>
Two new fortunes have been added to the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/" rel="nofollow">fortunes’ collection</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>

<ul>

<li><b>rindolf:</b> Su-Shee: “I always wonder why the people I hang
out with are so pedantic. And then I remember: because they are so
pedantic.” — a Perl-ILer. ;-)</li>

<li><b>Zaba:</b> rindolf, because they use warnings</li>

<li><i>* rindolf adds “use Zaba;” to his code.</i></li>
<li><b>Zaba:</b> oh no, I’m being used!</li>

<li><i>* rindolf adds “abuse Zaba;” to his code.</i></li>

<li><b>rindolf:</b> Next: “misuse Zaba;”</li>

<li><b>Zaba:</b> ouch!</li>

</ul>

</blockquote>

<p>
The English version of
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/politics/drug-legalisation/" rel="nofollow">“The
Case for Drug Legalisation”</a> is now at the second revision with
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/politics/drug-legalisation/#note_about_politicians_supporting_the_prohibition" rel="nofollow">a
note about “Why Politicians Support The Prohibition”</a>.
</p>

<p>
There’s now
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/black-hole-solitaire-solver/" rel="nofollow">an
    automated solver for Black Hole Solitaire</a> available on the site
and I also started maintaining
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/libtap/" rel="nofollow">libtap</a>
again. I also added
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/bits.html#set_xfce_workspaces" rel="nofollow">a
    Ruby script for setting the names (and number) of XFCE’s workspaces/virtual
    desktops</a>.
</p>

<p>
Links to some prominent programs were added to
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/numerical-software/" rel="nofollow">the
    Directory of Numerical Software page</a>.
</p>

<p>
The annoying text-on-hover over the sections of all the DocBook/XML-based
essays (using the title attribute) was eliminated by using a DocBook/XSL
customisation.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I performed many changes to the homepage’s internals and build system
that will allow for an easier maintenance into the future.
