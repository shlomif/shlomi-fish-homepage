<h2>New on Shlomi Fish’s Homepage: Selina Mandrake, NSA/Buffy/Chuck Norris facts, Yachar's Music</h2>

<!-- Tags: facts, chuck norris, buffy, humour, funny, github, nsa

<p>
Here are the recent updates for <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi
Fish’s Homepage</a>. This time, the highlight is a lot of interesting new
content.
</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
I have started writing a comprehensive essay
titled
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/">“Putting
    all the Cards on the Table (2013)”</a>, which is also syndicated as
<a href="http://unarmed.shlomifish.org/2109.html">a blog post</a> on my
<i>Unarmed but Still Dangerous</i> blog. Here is the abstract for it:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
What is the problem with the Technion and why is it graver in M.I.T., and
why you should watch the film
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Linings_Playbook"><i>Silver
Linings Playbook</i></a> to realise why it's
not a problem? Why was the David who fought Goliath a hacker, and what is the
difference between a tragic hero and an action hero? What was the second major
battle that Chuck Norris lost? What are the machines that can give us
questions (and lots of them)? Why not exerting a mental effort will make
matters go from bad to worse? Who was the Jennifer Lawrence of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_1.0">Web 1.0</a>? And
what were my two greatest mistakes, which you should not duplicate?
</p>
<p>
I got tired of truly intellectual people like me speaking in riddles
all the time and kinda lying to themselves and to others in their artworks,
and hiding a lot of what they know, so I decided to put all the cards I have
now on the table in a big tour-de-force. It's not finished yet, but still
usable, and there's more to come. Not a perfect essay, and not for everyone,
but imperfect and sweet.

<p>
There is an ongoing
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Pope/The-Pope-Died-on-Sunday--English-Text.html">English translation</a> of
my old and incomplete story
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Pope/">“The Pope Died on Sunday”</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Much more text has been added to
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/"><i>Selina Mandrake
- The Slayer</i></a> (a Buffy parody) and it is now in a usable condition:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[
There are three young men dressed as Klingons who fight with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat%27leth">Bat’leth</a> in the park.
Selina is passing by and shakes her head in disapproval. The three notice Selina,
and quickly run to her.
]
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Warrior #1:</strong> Hail The Slayer, we are but your humble slaves!
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Shocked]</span> And who might you be?
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Warrior #1:</strong> We are The Three - three vampire brother warriors, who have been
fighting since the dawn of time.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> And you are Klingons…
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Warrior #2:</strong> We can assume any form.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Warrior #1:</strong> Yes, we can fight using any weapon, and we are masters of them
all.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> so you can fight with something that’s not a Bat’leth?
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Warrior #1:</strong> Of course, for example, we could fight using the Huge Sword!
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Warrior #2 and Warrior #3:</strong> Yeah, the Huge Sword!
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">The Three:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[in unison]</span> Huge Sword!
</p>
<p>
[
Warrior #1 snaps his fingers, and some of these ridiculously large swords
from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft">World of
Warcraft</a>
appear on the ground.
]
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> Wow, can you fight using them?
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">The Three:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[non-dramatically]</span> Eh, eh, we cannot lift them.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> Guess not. <span class="inlinedesc">[Puts her palm on her eyes.]</span> Maybe try something smaller
and not as heavy.
</p>

<p>
In addition, there are many enhancements to the section of the page, including
a page about
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/cast.html">who
I think should play the characters in the screenplay</a>, and
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/#ebook">an Ebook</a>
available for purchase.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
There are two new pages with facts about people and things:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/NSA/">NSA Facts</a> -
about the United States’ National Security Agency:
</p>

<blockquote>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
The NSA knows what you did last summer. But no one, in the NSA or outside it, knows why they should.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The more the NSA think, the less they want to be able to think. So they think
less and less.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
First the NSA ignores “silly” Internet memes, then they laugh at them, then
they are unable to fight them, and then they lose.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Buffy/">Facts about
Buffy Summers</a> from the Television series
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_%28TV_series%29"><i>Buffy
the Vampire Slayer</i></a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Buffy will always find a wooden stake to slay vampires, even if it means she
will have travelled 100 years back in time, to plant a tree nearby.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

</ol>

<p>
Extra additions to these or other collections of facts would be welcome.

<li>
<p>
I have placed
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/art/by-others/Yachar/">Yachar’s
old music</a> from Jamendo.com on my homepage, because they appear to have
been removed from Jamendo.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
There’s a new page with a partial list of some of my
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/art/recommendations/music/online-artists/">favourite
online musicians</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/">Chuck

<p>
Chuck Norris can make East and West meet.

</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I have placed the sources for
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/">the
    stories and screenplays</a> in self-contained distributed version control
repositories
(DVCS) - mostly on my <a href="http://github.com/shlomif">GitHub account</a>,
and they contain mostly self-contained build systems. You can find links
to their repositories on their appropriate pages.
