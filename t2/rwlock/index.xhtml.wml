<p>
This is a working implementation of a First-Come First-Served
Readers/Writers lock for POSIX threads. It is well commented and documented
so I believe it can also serve as a reference implementation for those
who wish to implement such a mechanism for other platforms.

<h3>What is a Readers/Writers Lock?</h3>

<p>
A Readers/Writers Lock (or RWLock for short) is a mechanism that allows an
arbitrary number of readers or alternatively one writer to access a
resource at any given time. It is useful in case writing may temporarily harm
the integrity of the resource.
</p>

<h3>What is a First-Come First-Served RWLock?</h3>

<p>
Many RWLock implementations arbitrate the various readers and writers in a
manner that may cause starvation of either readers or writers. For instance,
a readers/writers lock that prefers readers may cause a writer to starve
(i.e: wait for a very long time or indefinitely) if there are two and more
competing readers.
</p>

<p>
A First-Come First-Served (FCFS) RWLock solves this problem by making sure
that the pending threads are served at the same order as the time of their
arrival. Thus, starvation is eliminated assuming that a thread does not
obtain the lock indefinitely (which in any case should not happen in a
well-designed system).
</p>

<h3>How does it make sure that’s what going to happen?</h3>

<p>
By using a queue in which each element controls a pending thread. A detailed
description of the algorithm can be found <a href="Scheme.txt">here</a> and
naturally, there are also the comments in the code. If there’s anything you
don’t understand, don’t hesitate to
<a href="$(ROOT)/me/contact-me/">contact me</a>
and ask.
</p>

<p>
Recently, the algorithm was modified to pack several readers or several
writers on the same queue element, which results in saving of condition
variables. The new scheme for it (which is a bit more complex) can be found
<a href="Scheme_RLE.txt">here</a>.
