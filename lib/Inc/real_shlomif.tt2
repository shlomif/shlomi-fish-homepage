(= echoes of gamemasters), and that in the

highly successful, rich, revered, famous and admired.
I was a successful author, one of the film industry's biggest
screenwriters, a world famous "blogger" (= Internet / social media content
creator), and a remarkable <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/learning_more_from_inet_forums.xhtml">entertainer / educator / amateur philosopher</a>.

Most people's favourite candidate

A blogger whose blogging and thoughts have caused many other

Together with two companions, we formed a trio:

the Dwarf warrior/hacker from The Unforgettable Realms.

Having been "killed" in his RPG role, Rindolf accepted a software
development job comaintaining the
mostly-Perl code to the <a href="https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/faq.html#machine_learning">AI</a> "Shlomi Fish".
