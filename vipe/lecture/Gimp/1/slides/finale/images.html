<h1 class="fcs">8.2 Origins and Copyrights of the Images</h1>

<p>
The images used for this lecture can be found 
<a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/Gimp/1/images/">here</a>.
This page is meant to detail their origins and their copyright notices.
</p>

<h2>lena.png</h2>

<p>
This image is available from this page:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.eso.org/~ndevilla/lena.html">
http://www.eso.org/~ndevilla/lena.html - The Lena Story
</a>
</p>

<p>
It is part of a Playboy centerfold and copyrighted by Playboy corporation.
The latter, however has given permission to use this particular portion freely
for image processing research.
</p>

<p>
The image there is available in GIF format, but I converted it to PNG.
</p>

<h2>lena_color.jpg</h2>

<p>
I found this image here:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.lenna.org/">http://www.lenna.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
It seems to be the colour original of the Grayscale one. Usually, the 
grayscale one is used for image processing research (probably because 
scientific journals are usually not printed in colour), but I decided to
use the colour version too here.
</p>

<h2>tiger_sitting.jpg</h2>
<h2>karakal.jpg</h2>

<p>
Those images were found on the image archive of Gimp-Savvy:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://gimp-savvy.com/PHOTO-ARCHIVE/">

</a>
</p>

<p>
It is copyright-free, so you can do with it as you please.
</p>

<h2>g_anwar1.jpg</h2>

<p>
This is a photograph of Gabrielle Anwar, which can be found here:
</p>

<p>
It looks like it was scanned from a magazine, so it's almost surely 
copyrighted. However, distribution of copyrighted images on the Internet is
so common, so I don't think one has anyting to be afraid of by using this
image. Publishing it is a different story, though.
</p>

<h2>A-Little-Exercise-3.jpg</h2>
<h2>Fifteen-Cent-Ramen-1.jpg</h2>

<p>
These images are part of the Propaganda collection of desktop backgrounds. 
(whose web-site is now defunct). They (and more) can be found at 
<a href="http://x.themes.org/">x.themes.org</a>. You can try searching for
propaganda:

namedes=propaganda&odby=name&sc=asc&displaytype=normal&numthemes=10&category=21
</a>
</p>

</p>

<p>
They are distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which 
I'm not sure if makes too much sense for images. They were created
using the GIMP, but the scripts or the temporary images used to create them are
not available as far as I know.
