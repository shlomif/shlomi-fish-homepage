<p>
This is a parody of the television series
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_%28TV_series%29">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>, while referencing other pieces of popular
culture, and has many ties to my other screenplay,
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">Star Trek: “We, the
Living Dead”</a>. It’s far-fetched, but, on the other hand, conveys some
serious messages and insights.
</p>

<p>
Hope you enjoy it!

<a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppets_%282011%29"><i>The Muppets (2011)</i> film</a>
- I saw this film in the cinema and was impressed by its take on a brutal
honesty criticism of various 2010s culture, as seen by the apparently more old
fashioned (but still funny as ever) muppets. I eventually decided to adopt a
similar approach in writing <i>Selina</i>, both as a criticism of some
of our contemporary culture, and more importantly as a way to honestly convey
my farfetched imaginary world (induced by a long period of

in the fact that Selina starts as a normal teenager, who just happens to
be geeky and knowledgeable enough to be dangerous.
</p>

<p>
However, like Harry Potter and his good friend Hermione Granger,
she secretly wishes that there was more to this world than meets the eye,
only to discover this is the case, to her great apparent dismay. And now
she has to find a way to handle the situation gracefully.
</p>

<p>
While Harry and Hermione find assistance using supernatural magic, Selina only
has her own natural slaying resources of her words and actions, which turn
out to be enough.

Well, since this work is a parody of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer"><i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i></a> (written by

I am theoretically protected by the Copyright’s

I’m putting it here on this site in hope it will amuse or inspire

read Dumas’

charging people any money to download, build, or view the works, but I
have some web commercials which I’m making some small money from, and which
I hope are acceptable to the copyright holders. Please don’t sue me.
