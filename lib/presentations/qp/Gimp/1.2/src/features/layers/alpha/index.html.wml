<p>
Every layer contains a special layer called the "alpha layer" that
specifies its opacity. This layer is treated as a black and white bitmap
that can be manipulated with all the normal tools, and in which black is
considered full transparency (zero opacity) and white is full opacity
between this layer and the layer below it.
</p>

<p>
The Resultant pixel of the two layers is calculated using the formula:
</p>

<p>
Result = (1-alpha) * Pixel<sub>Below</sub> + alpha * Pixel<sub>Above</sub>
