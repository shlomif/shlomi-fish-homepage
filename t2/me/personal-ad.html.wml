I, Shlomi Fish (a.k.a Rindolf “Aim-very-high” Hitlower) am looking for a
girlfriend, who will be:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
A <b>geek</b> (=
<a href="http://paulgraham.com/opensource.html">“amateur”</a>, someone who
loves what they do, not necessarily a computer/software geek).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
A
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#david_and_goliath">hacker</a> (= an action hero/heroine,
someone who bends or even breaks the rules, and does not accept their
fate, all in order to earn their victory).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/DocBook5/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/trying_to_please_everybody.html">confident</a>
(which implies giving
yourself the leeway to make mistakes and to avoid trying to please everyone
at any given time)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
In the Tel Aviv and vicinity area.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Who avoids prejudice,
and is always on the path for self-growth and optimism
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
A non-smoker.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Speaks English and/or Israeli Hebrew.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Now, about me, here's
<a href="http://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-business-card">my card</a>:
</p>

<img src="$(ROOT)/me/images/bizcard-400w.png" alt="Shlomi Fish’s Business Card" style="background-color: white; border: 0.5em black solid; border-radius: 0.35em;" />

<p>
It reads: «Shlomi Fish (“Shlomif” or “Rindolf”); Humorist, Writer, and Software
Geek ; <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">http://www.shlomifish.org/</a> ; <a
href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a> ; Mobile:
+972-54-6232377».
</p>

<p>
So what do I have to offer for the relationship?
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
A great <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/">sense of humour</a>,
and experiences and insights from an active
<a href="#shlomif_on_the_web">presence on social media venues</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I’m an intelligent, confident, and as a result - attractive and competent,
geek and hacker, who is a capable writer,
humorist and software developer,
likes to socialise - both in real life and on Internet social media forums -
is opinionated but always gives a benefit of doubt (and hates people who
proclaim they are sure of the certainty of certain things).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I belong to the <a href="$(ROOT)/me/rindolf/#rindolfism">“Rindolfism” school
of philosophy</a> where Rindolfism is my personal, one-man, and dynamic (=
constantly changes) idea system with many influences.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
A promise that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDl88R6z2Fw">I will always
love you</a> for the simple reason that I love all past, present and
future human beings out there. Furthermore, often my admiration for one’s
competence and strength, manifests itself in being sexually attracted to them.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
That put aside, I cannot promise being “faithful”. One day it’s possible that
I’ll find the need to terminate our relationship, and we both move on. I also
feel that two partners in a relationship don’t own each other’s love life
or sex life - they just share them. And finally, we both are allowed to
flirt with other people.
</p>
</li>


</ul>
