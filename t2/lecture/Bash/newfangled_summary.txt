Summary of Bourne Shell Lecture


Motivation:

* Bash is the de-facto shell on Linux.

* One can write and debug complete scripts on one line of the command
prompt.

* Sometimes Bash Scripts are faster to write and/or easier to understand
than the equivalent perl scripts.

* "./configure" scripts are written in Bourne shell, and knowledge of it
is required to effectively use GNU autoconf.

* /bin/sh is expected to be available on any UNIX system by virtue of POSIX.

* "Csh Programming Considered Harmful" by Tom Christiansen:

Pipeline:
---------

One can pipe the output of one command to the input of another by using
the "|". Examples:

ls -l | less
	pages the output of ls -l
cat *.c *.h | wc -l
	Determines how many lines are in c and h
ls -l | grep '^d' | wc -l
	Counts the number of directories in the CWD. (* - what MosheZ noted)

Variables:
----------

Assign by using "MYVAR=value". No spaces before or after the "=". To assign
more than one word use something like:

MYVAR="More than one word"

To retrieve the value use $MYVAR or "$MYVAR" if you wish it to be considered
as one atom. Another common syntax is ${MYVAR}.

The command "read MYVAR" reads a line from the standard input and places it
inside MYVAR.

Examples:

echo "Enter a number:"
read NUM
RESULT=`expr $NUM \* 2`
echo "$NUM * 2 = $RESULT"

If Constructs:
--------------

If the program return value is 0 it is considered true, else it is 1. Some
programs, such as test and expr were designed so their return value can be
used within shell scripts.

* Use if .. elif .. else .. fi to have a conditional:

#!/bin/sh
echo "Please enter a number:"
read A

if expr $A \> 1000 > /dev/null ; then
	echo "$A is greater than one thousand"
elif expr $A \> 100 > /dev/null ; then
	echo "$A is greater than one hundred"
else
	echo "$A is lesser or equal to one hundred"
fi

Note: the condition can be any program or builtin command that returns
a status.

- Notice the use of semicolons. In fact, if the echo's were terminated by
semicolons, it was possible to write the entire expression on one line, like
this:

- The output of "expr" is redirected to /dev/null so the "0"'s and "1"'s it
returns will not be displayed.

While:
------

Use while to execute a group of statement as long as a condition is met:

#!/bin/sh

A=1
while expr $A \<= 100 > /dev/null ; do
	echo $A
	A=`expr $A + 1`
done

One can iterate over all the lines of the standard input with "while read
MYVAR" :

#!/bin/sh

find . -name '*.c' |
(while read T ; do
	cp $T $T.bak ;
 done)

For:
----

Use for to iterate over a group of values:

for I in *.c *.h ; do
	cp $I $I.bak
done

- Notice: If you wish to pre-specify the values you wish to iterate over in
a statement then use for I in $MYLIST. For example:

MYLIST="one two three four"
for I in $MYLIST ; do
	echo $I
done

- If you wish to have whitespaces inside the arguments use the following
method:

MYLIST="Hello \"My World\" You Too"

eval "for I in $MYLIST ; do echo \$I ; done"


&& and ||
---------

- <Statement 1> && <Statement 2> will execute Statement 2 iff Statement 1
    returns a true value.

  <Statement 1> || <Statement 2> will execute Statement 2 iff Statement 1
    returns a false value.

Trapping Command Output
-----------------------

Use backquotes (` `) to trap the output of a command. Example:

A=5
B=`expr $A + 1`  # Get the number following A
echo $B

Another option, which is useful if you have more than one line is to
pipe the output to a  (while read ... ) loop, or to pipe to xargs. xargs
is a GNU extension and is not available on all systems.

Bash, zsh and ash also offer $( .... ), which does the same operation
as the backquotes except that it behaves as a sub-shell, not as a string.
E.g: B=$( A=5 ; echo $A ) will assign 5 to B. Again, I'm not sure if
proprietary System V sh's offer this functionality.



Sub-shells
----------

a ( ... ) wraps a sub-shell, which is a separate process that executes a
mini-shell script. All modifications to variables inside it will not be
apparent on the main script.

find . -name '*.c' |
(
	while read T ; do
		A=`echo $T | sed 's/\\.c\$//'`
		cp $T $A.bak
	done
)

# A or T are not set here.
