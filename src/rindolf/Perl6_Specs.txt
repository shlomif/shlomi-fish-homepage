Perl6 aims at being the ideal language for data and text processing,
and that OSes themselves will be written with it. It is based on perl5
with the following changes:

----------
Strong Contextualism

A subroutine or a variable declared inside a context is inaccasible
outside the context ({ .... }). FuM, if two functions are declared in a
context than they are called in accordance to their appearance. For
example:

use strict;

{
    my ($a);

    $a = 6;
    sub hello()
    {
        print "Hello", $a;
    }

    hello(); # Will print Hello6

    sub hello()
    {
        print "Goodbye";
    }

    hello(); # Will print goodbye
}

&hello(); # Will generate an error.
$a = 3; # Will generate an error


-------------------------
New or modified keywords and built-in functions

A static() keyword would be introduced and its meaning is much like in
C. local() should be omitted.
The keyword super() will temporarily return control to the process that
spanned the current line of executiion. It may never return.



----------------------------
Data Types:

Binary & other types of numbers. (0-9+ ....)

Scalars (strings of unlimited size)   ('', "", etc.)

Lists. (limited in length, unlimited in capacity)

Hashes (lists which are treated as such)

File handles (*Input, *Output)
