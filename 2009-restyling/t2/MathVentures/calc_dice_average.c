		Okay, this program uses a pseudo-recursion algorithm to iterate
		over all the possible throws. The basic idea is that every throw
		is represented by an array, where every member designates one
		die.
		
		At the end of every iteration we increment the first die by one,
		switching it to its next possible state. If it is already equal to 
		num_dice however we reset it to one, and increment the next_die 
		instead, and so on. This process is analogous to incrementing a 
		number written in a digital form by 1.
		
		The process stops after the iteration in which all the dice are
		equal to num_dice. Implementing the loop with real recursion would
		have been much more time and memory consuming, because of the 
		frequent function calls and exits.
