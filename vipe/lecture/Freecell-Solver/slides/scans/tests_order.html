5.1 Specifying the Order of Tests
</h1>
<h3 class="notbold">
<ul>
<li>
A test is a function that attempts to generate new boards using meta-moves.
</li>
<li>
Each test used to be implemented in its own separate block of code,
but they were only run one by one.
</li>
<li>
Later on, they were put in separate functions, each was assigned an ID,
and the user could specify in what order to run them (or a subset of them).
</li>
<li>
Choosing a good subset turned out to solve some difficult to solve boards,
very quickly.
</li>
</ul>
