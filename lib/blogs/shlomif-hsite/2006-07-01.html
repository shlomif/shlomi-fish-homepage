Well, there were a few new additions to my home site since the last update,
but not enough to warrant a new update. However, I'd like to take this stage
to announce a URL transition and to also ask for people's advice regarding
some issues.
</p>

<p>
However, one important note is that
the sub-section of the site that used to live under 
http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/ is now living under 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/Vipe/">http://www.shlomifish.org/Vipe/</a>. 
</p>

<p>
This change was done due to the constant downtime of vipe.technion.ac.il. Note
that the server itself is usually up and running and responsive, but the
connection to it gets down. Another benefits of this are the fact that 
everything would be on one host, which would make mirroring, backup and 
maintenance easier.
</p>

<p>
A more long-term plan would be to move all resources directly under
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">http://www.shlomifish.org/</a>, but
that will take some extra work, and will be done incrementally. Meanwhile,
there may still be some links to the old domain. I hope to find them all
by myself, but if you can still find some, please
<a href="mailto:shlomif@iglu.org.il">report them to me</a>.
</p>

<p>
Now, for the questions:

    The web-site at the moment is almost entirely static HTML. With all the
    Web 2.0 craze, people are talking about making sites more dynamic, user
    editable and interactive. So I thought it may be nice to have comments,
    or a wiki to complement the site etc. Some sites provide commenting 
    services. At the moment, I linked the articles to conversations in
    which they were placed.
