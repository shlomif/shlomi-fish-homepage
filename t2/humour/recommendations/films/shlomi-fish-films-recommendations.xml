<p>
This is my favourite movie, and the favourite of a lot of others from
my generation. It has an excellent dialogue, with many power sentences. The
acting is excellent, and the film is very enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
The Princess Bride has the format of a classic fairy tale, but with a few
interesting and non-ordinary twists. It is funny, engaging and highly
recommended.

<p>
    Spaceballs is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Essentially a 
    parody of Star Wars and other Science-Fiction films, this films features
    Druish Princesses, merceneries who "don't do it for money", but rather
    for "a shitload of money", an old small alien guru who claims that you
    should "never underestimate the power of the Schwartz".
</p>

<p>
    I've seen this movie several times, and have either enjoyed it, or found
    it disappointing alternately. But the first time is a blast.

                            Disney movies. It's funny, fun, with a lot 
                            of great songs and other music, with many jokes
                            and anecdotes, and with a great plot.

                            I've seen it several times and always enjoyed
                            it. I've also read the first book in the series,
                            and it's also nice, but very different from
                            the movie.

                    <desc>
<p>
A wonderful French bittersweet comedy that takes place in early-2000
France. Amélie is a young woman who was raised in solitude, and is 
starting to familiarise herself with the outside world. She tries to do
good deeds to her loved ones, and avenge a man she hates. 
</p>

<p>
Funny, exciting, and engaging - Amélie is a wonderful movie.

<p>
I saw this movie several times on television, and liked what I saw. An
Irishman decides to popularise his Bed and Breakfast hotel by pretending
it is a ghost castle and inviting several American guests to stay there.
But much to everyone's surprise, real actual ghosts appear and start
haunting the living.
</p>

<p>
My favourite quote from the movie is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Oh my God, What have I done? Oh my God! What have I done? Oh my God! What
a woman!
</p>

                            The Naked Guns are among the funniest movies
                            I've ever seen. I've watched them many times
                            on T.V. (and watched the third one originally
                            in the cinema), and like them almost every time
                            I watch them.

                            of his friends. The movies have a lot of jokes,

                            to absurd situations.

                                Wars</a>. I watched these movies on video
                            as a child, and recall liking them a lot. Star
                            Wars is a mixture of Science Fiction, Fantasy,
                            and Adventure, with a lot of vivid imagination,
                            wonderful special effects (especially for
                            its time) and an engaging plot.

<p>
An adaptation to film of the first part of <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neverending_Story">the 
Novel "The Neverending Story" by Michael Ende</a> (which I've read later and
can also recommend). The film is aesthetically pleasing, with wonderful
special effects, exotic fantastical creatures, great acting, and wonderful
and atmospheric music.
</p>

<p>
This is one of the finest fantasy movies I've ever seen, and I highly
recommend it.

                            This is my favourite of the new crop of Disney
                            animated films. Inspired by African legends,
                            the Lion King tells the story of a lion cub,
                            who learns about the place of his kind in Nature.

                            A few people told me that they heard people
                            claim this movie was <a 
                                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism">pro-Fascist</a>,
                            but there are some obvious anti-Fascist elements
                            in it, and I didn't find it so.

                            This film has great visual side, very nice
                            songs and music, great dialogues, a lot of
                            funny bits, and an engaging plot. Highly
                            recommended.

                            This is probably the funniest Disney animated
                            picture. An emperor of a pseudo-South American

                            into a

                            Now he's trying to become a human again, with lots 
                            of fun for the viewers in the process.

                            A positively touching, funny and beautiful film
                            about a sports agent who decides to change the way
