During one of the Israeli Independence days, my high school friend and I bought
plastic noise-emitting hammers. Later that evening, we used them to fence,
while at the shopping centre. It was fun.

<p>
Some days later, back at school, a different friend criticised us for having
fenced in public. But whatâ€™s wrong with that? People do that at
sci-fi/fantasy/etc. cons all the time.
