                    <p> Writing a BitKeeper replacement is probably easier at
                        this point than getting its license changed.  </p>

                    <p> P.S: Matt Mackall has eventually projected Mercurial,
                        which is a version control system,
                        and an alternative to BitKeeper.</p>

                        it sells to the outside.

                        Great. Just Great. I wanted to remain a lazy leech, just using the
                        selfless work others have done on subversion for my own personal
                        advantage. The problem is, as soon as I read HACKING and learn how to
                        submit a patch and begin by contributing something as tiny as a FAQ fix,
                        I'll be hooked, and I'll start to become a contributing member of
                        society. Next, I'm afraid I'll want to tackle a bite-sized task and help
                        fix bugs and develop the product. (You guys are so sneaky!!)  :-)

                    <p>Hi, </p>

                    <p> a friend of mine runs a small restaurant and wants to
                        professionalize his IT. Our idea was to store
                        everything in subversion (we use Debian with svn 1.3).
                        We had absolutely no problems with the 2D objects,
                        converting recipes to ASCII and storing them was
                        peanuts. However the 3D objects are giving us a
                        headache - the forks and knifes are stuck in the
                        keyboard, we even destroyed a floppy drive trying to
                        read an apple.  </p>

                    <p> Any ideas how we can still use SVN to store everything?
                    </p>

                    <p> Linus isn't saying that CVS and Subversion have fixable
                        bugs or missing features. It's not about the code.
                    </p>

                    <p> He is saying that they solve the wrong problem. The
                        Subversion team wants to solve Problem A, and Linus
                        wants to solve Problem B. No amount of code will turn
                        the solution to Problem A into a solution for Problem
                        B. Bothering the Subversion team with code addressing
                        Problem B will only irritate them, since they're
                        working on Problem A.  </p>

                    <p> The right way to handle differing goals is to start a
                        different project. That's what he did.  </p>

                    <p> Don't be confused by the labels. Source Code Management
                        means different things to different people, and there
                        isn't always much overlap in how each person defines
                        it. Ships and airplanes are both 'vehicles', but that
                        doesn't mean that a few changes will turn one to the
                        other.  </p>

                        His argument is that it may destroy binary files.
                    </p>

                    <p> This is bogus since keyword-substitution is *off* by
                        default.  It will occur only for files that were
                        explicitly marked for substitution. For example in
                        subversion: </p>

                    <p> svn propset svn:keywords "Id Author Revision" *.h *.c
                    </p>

                    <p> As a substitute (pun intended) for the lack in this
                        feature he gives a hand crafted, build system
                        dependent, manual (i.e: error prone) method.  </p>

                    <p> What a lame excuse.  </p>

                    <p> Computer Scientists love git, not just because it comes
                        first alphabetically, but because it's stupid. Everyone
                        else loves git because it's GIT!  </p>

                    <p> "Git is the stupid content tracker." </p>

                    <p> And git doesn't waste space on my Newton MessagePad.
                        Just look: </p>

                    <p> -rwxr-xr-x 1 root 24 Oct 29 2009 /bin/git<br />
                        -rwxr-xr-t 4 root 1310720 Jan 1 2005 /usr/bin/hg<br />
                        -rwxr-xr-x 1 root 5.89824e37 Oct 22 2001
                        /usr/local/subversion/bin/svn<br /> </p>

                    <p> Of course, on the system *I* administrate, hg is
                        symlinked to git.  svn has been replaced by a shell
                        script which 1) Generates a syslog message at level
                        LOG_EMERG; 2) reduces the user's disk quota by 10GB;
                        and 3) RUNS GIT!!!!!!  </p>

                    <p> "Git is the stupid content tracker." </p>

                    <p> Git, the greatest WYGIWYG revision control system of
                        all.  </p>

                    <p> GIT IS THE TRUE PATH TO NIRVANA! GIT HAS BEEN THE
                        CHOICE OF EDUCATED AND IGNORANT ALIKE FOR CENTURIES!
                        GIT WILL NOT CORRUPT YOUR PRECIOUS BODILY FLUIDS!! GIT
                        IS THE STUPID CONTENT TRACKER! GIT MAKES THE SUN SHINE
                        AND THE BIRDS SING AND THE GRASS GREEN!! GIT WAS HANDED
                        DOWN TO US FROM LINUS UPON THE MOUNTAIN, AND LINUX
                        USERS SHALL NOT WORSHIP ANY OTHER TRACKER!  </p>

                    <p> When I use a version control system, I don't want eight
                        extra MEGABYTES of worthless HTTP protocol support. I
                        just want to GIT on with my coding! I don't want to
                        subvert away or mercurialize!  Those aren't even
                        WORDS!!! GIT! GIT! GIT IS THE STUPID!!!  </p>

                    <p> CONTENT TRACKER.  </p>

                    <p> When Linus, in his ever-present omnipotence, needed to
                        base his patch juggling habits on existing tools, did
                        he mimic svn? No. Hg? Surely you jest. He created the
                        most karmic version tracker of all. The stupid one.
                    </p>

                    <p> Git is for those who can *remember* what project they
                        are working on.  If you are an idiot, you should use
                        subversion. If you are subversive, you should not be
                        mercurial. If you use GIT, you are on THE PATH TO
                        REDEMPTION. THE SO-CALLED "FRIENDLY" SCM SYSTEMS HAVE
                        BEEN PLACED HERE BY GIT TO TEMPT THE FAITHLESS. DO NOT
                        GIVE IN!!! THE MIGHTY LINUS HAS SPOKEN!!!  </p>
