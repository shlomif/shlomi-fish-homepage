<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
Inexperienced people often have trouble finding solutions to their (usually
technical) problems online. This essay aims to give some guidelines for
how to effectively find help online.
</p>

<h2 id="due_diligence">First of all - due diligence</h2>

<p>
The first thing to do when running into a problem, is try to find the
answer yourself. You can try consulting the documentation of the program
, especially its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAQ">“FAQ” - the
so-called “Frequently Asked Questions”</a> document (assuming it exists),
followed by visiting its wiki (= its world-editable site - assuming there
is one) and if that fails, use a web search engine. Some recommended search
engines are:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://www.google.com/">Google Web Search</a>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups</a>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is still possible that you still will not find your answer. In this
case, you should ask for advice using the following mediums.
</p>

<h2 id="irc">IRC - Internet Relay Chat</h2>

<p>
IRC stands for <b>Internet Relay Chat</b>, and it is a distributed,
real-time form
of communication, that was common from relatively early in the history of
the Internet, and is still very popular. IRC servers form networks of servers
- each network is separated from the other networks and the servers of each
network share the same chat-rooms, user profiles and messages. Each network
has different rules and conventions and a different culture. This allows
chat-rooms (called channels in IRC-jargon) with the same name to exist in
different networks.
</p>

<p>
Some popular IRC clients include the cross-platform
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/rt-messaging/chatzilla/">Chatzilla</a>
(which is part of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">the Mozilla project</a>),
the Windows-based <a href="http://www.mirc.com/">mIRC</a> (which is shareware
and not open-source) and <a href="http://hexchat.github.io/">HexChat</a>, a
cross-platform IRC client for all UNIX systems including Linux and Mac OS X,
and for Microsoft Windows. By downloading one, you can log in to an IRC
network and start chatting, and often IRC networks provide a web interface
that does not require downloading a client.
</p>

<p>
IRC is a great way to get answers to questions quickly and easily. Just note
that some networks are not recommended for asking questions on, due to
the treatment of beginner question, or general unfriendliness.
</p>

<p>
Some recommended IRC networks are:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode</a> - provides discussion facilities
for the open source communities and for related communities.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.oftc.net/">OFTC</a> - smaller than Freenode and less
popular, but some projects prefer it for their chats, and it is also a
friendly IRC network.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Note that one common mistake that newcomers to IRC do is to private-message
a user that helps them (using the <code>/msg</code> command) instead of keeping
the discussion on the channel. To reply to someone, type (or complete using
the tab key) their nickname, add ":" or "," and say what you want to reply.
