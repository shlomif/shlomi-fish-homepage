<p>
One can use regular expression to substitute an occurence
of a regular expression found inside a string to something else. The operator
used for this is <tt>s/$exp_to_search/$exp_to_subs_for/</tt>. The following 
simple program replaces a number with the string "Some Number":
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/regexps/substitute/number.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
Notice that in this case, only the first occurence of the string will be 
substituted. The <tt>g</tt> switch which will be covered soon, enables us to 
substitute <b>all</b> of the occurences.
</p>

<p>
One can include the captures that are matched in the expression as part of
the substitution string. The first capture is <tt>$1</tt>, the 
second <tt>$2</tt> etc. 
</p>

<p>
Here's an example which reverses the order of two words at the beginning of a
sentence:
</p>


<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/regexps/substitute/reverse_words.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>


<table class="note">
<tr class="note">
<td class="note">

<h3 class="note">Note</h3>

<p>
The <tt>$1</tt>, <tt>$2</tt> variables are also available after the regular 
expression match or substitution is performed, and can be used inside
your perl code.
