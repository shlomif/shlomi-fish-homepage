<b>1 April, 2015, Tel Aviv, Israel:</b> Today, the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) announced the immediate availability of the new version of the web —
<b>HTML 6</b> — pronounced “HTML Sicks [sic]” with the motto “HTML 6 is sick!”.
“We concluded that the previous version of the World Wide Web’s standards
suite, HTML5, has exceeded its flexibility and usability, and we need to
start over”, said Tim Berners Lee, the director of the W3C.
