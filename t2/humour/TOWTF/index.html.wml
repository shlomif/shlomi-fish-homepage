<p>
This is a parody of Ayn Rand’s novel,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead"><i>The
Fountainhead</i></a>, modelled around a two part episode of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends">the
Television show <i>Friends</i></a>. Somewhat unhappy with the original
book, the six friends in the show role-play their own version of
<i>The Fountainhead</i>, while trying to improve upon it. Will they
succeed?
</p>

<p>
I consider this piece my funniest yet.

<define-tag reviews>
A friend of mine who read the book, but didn’t watch <i>Friends</i> found this
piece highly entertaining. Moreover, an English lady I’ve been talking with
online, who likes Friends and hasn’t read the book yet, also liked reading
this creation of mine. So it is probably good enough for people who are
familiar with only one of the two sources of inspiration.
</define-tag>

<h2 id="suitability">Suitability</h2>

<p>
This work was enjoyed by people who were only familiar with either the
Fountainhead or the Friends T.V. show.

Omer gave a positive review of an early draft of the screenplays, and gave
some useful commentary.

<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/gwenshap">Gwen (Chen) Shapira</a> - stumbled
across the screenplay after visiting my home site as it was back then, and
after mentioning it to her in a real-life conversation, she noted that it was
“one of the most horrid things I have read lately”, to which I replied,
“Yes, well, I wrote it.”.
</p>
<p>
As it turns out, she had not read either <i>The Fountainhead</i> or watched
<i>Friends</i> at the time, and then went on to read all of Ayn Rand’s books.

appear to enjoy my parody.

<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>

<p>
Well, since this work is a parody of The Fountainhead (written by Ayn Rand
and now still kept by the Ayn Rand estate), and contains characters from there,
I am theoretically protected by the Copyright’s
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use#Fair_use_and_parody">“right of
parody”</a> as part of the ”Fair Use” provision. There are other parodies of
Ayn Rand works online and possibly offline, and no one was sued yet.
</p>

<p>
However, I have used characters and concepts from the T.V. show <i>Friends</i>,
and while some parts of my work parody the show in some respect, I consider
it as an ordinary fan-fiction work of Friends, rather than as a parody of it.
As a result, I consider it a derivative work of Friends, which, like it or not
and according to the contemporary Copyright Law, may mean it is encumbered by
the claims of its copyright holders. Again, I’ve seen other fan fiction of
Friends around the Net.
</p>

<p>
All the text in “The One with the Fountainhead” is original, and as far as
I’m concerned can be used under the terms of
<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">the Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike licence Unported (CC-by-sa), either version 3.0, or at
your option any later version</a>, but like I said, the situation is
more complicated than that.
</p>

<p>
I’m putting it here on this site in hope it will amuse or inspire
people, and also because it may encourage people to read the Fountainhead, or
watch some episodes of Friends, both of which I can highly recommend. I’m not
charging people any money to download, build, or view the works, but I
have some web commercials which I’m making some small money from, and which
I hope are acceptable to the copyright holders. Please don’t sue me.
