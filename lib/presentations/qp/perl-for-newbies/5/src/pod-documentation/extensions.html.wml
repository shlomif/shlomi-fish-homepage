<p>
PseudoPod is an extended set of Pod tags used for book manuscripts. Standard

<a href="http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/#MOD">MJD's POD variant called MOD</a>
- this was used to write the book "Higher Order Perl", and one can download
the markup for the book and for source code for the MOD package from the
<a href="http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/#MOD">book's site</a>

<a href="http://metacpan.org/release/Perldoc/">Perldoc.pm</a> was an attempt
to modernise POD by

</ul>

of other Lightweight markup languages</a>, and some of them also have
implementations in Perl.
