                      Chuck Norris wrote a complete Perl 6 implementation in a day,
                      but then destroyed all evidence with his bare hands, so
                      no-one will know his secrets.

                      Bugs are too afraid to reproduce on Chuck Norris' 
                      computer. As a result, when he uses Microsoft Windows,

                      Chuck Norris is a real programmer. He writes programs by

                      false." a true one.

                      Chuck Norris can end world hunger, but he thinks that
                      hungry people make humanity a more challenging adversary.
                      If everyone had enough to eat, it would be too easy for
                      him.

                      Chuck Norris once wrote a 10 million lines C++ program in
                      Microsoft Notepad without having to use the backspace
                      key. And it compiled without errors or warnings, and was
                      100% bug-free.
