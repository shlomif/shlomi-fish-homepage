This is a list of modules to add to the Task-Sites-ShlomiFish :

App::XML::DocBook::Builder
XML::Grammar::Screenplay
XML::Grammar::Fortune
String::ShellQuote
XML::Grammar::Fortune::Synd::App

-----------------

* Fix XML-Grammar-ProductsSyndication - the --prefix should not be mandatory.
(See the post to the Module::Build mailing list.)

* Replace the latemp build system with a perl-based script. (SCons seems to
have broken compatibility).

* Fix XML-Grammar-Screenplay - the --prefix should not be mandatory.
(See the post to the Module::Build mailing list.)
