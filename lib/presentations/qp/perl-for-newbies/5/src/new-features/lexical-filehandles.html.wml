<p>
Traditionally Perl filehandles had been "typeglobs" - global names - normally
starting with an uppercase letter that were not scope safe. While they could
have been localised using "local", this was still a far cry from true
lexical scoping. perl-5.6.x, however,
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perl56delta.html#File-and-directory-handles-can-be-autovivified">introduced</a>
lexical filehandles for both file handles and directory handles.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example for a program implementing a directory listing.
</p>

<quadpres_code_file filename="src/new-features/ls.pl" />

<p>
And here is an example that copies a file:
</p>

<quadpres_code_file filename="src/new-features/copy.pl" />

<h2>IO::Handle and Friends</h2>

<p>
Perl provides a set of lexical and object-oriented abstractions for file
handles called IO::Handle. Starting from recent versions of Perl, one can
use them with the built-in perlfunc mechanisms. You can find more information
about them here:
