<p>
For some time, my strategy when riding the bus has been to try to sit in a
vacant seat, and hopefully the one that was next to the most attractive girl.

<p>
I am a secular Jewish resident of northern Tel Aviv, Israel.
</p>

<p>
For some time, I had thought that Arab-Israeli girls on the streets were either
wearing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab">Hijab</a>, the
traditional Muslim hair cover, and often looked cute — or did not and looked
unattractive. Then it hit me: perhaps the attractive ones who didn't have hair
covers, didn't look all too different from Jewish ones.
</p>

<p>
Now, one day I boarded a bus, and sat next to a beautiful girl with black hair.
After a while, I noticed there was text in Arabic letters on her smartphone.
Moreover, looking at her again, she struck me as looking Arabian, which she
hadn't beforehand!
</p>

<p>
Seems like God is playing tricks on me.

<p>
During one bus ride, I sat next to a beautiful blonde girl. I noticed she
consulted a map with text in the Latin alphabet, and after I struck a
conversation with her, she told me she was a tourist from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia">Croatia</a>. After
I helped her with some directions, I asked her how Croatia is pronounced
in Croatian, and it sounded like "khravachka" (but I likely got the Phonology
wrong).
</p>

<p>
She also told me she was a graphics artist by profession, which prompted
me to tell her about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape">Inkscape</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIMP">GIMP</a>.

<p>
I once struck a conversation with a girl who told me she was studying
alternative medicine. So I told her:
“Well, I studied something a bit more serious.”. Namely
<a href="[% base_path %]meta/FAQ/#what_did_you_study">Electrical Engineering in the Technion</a>; Bachelor of Science (B.Sc).
</p>

<p>
She agreed it was more serious, but later refused to give me her
contact info saying that <q>We are strangers</q>.
