<li>
In the GIMP, effects and filters are implemented using plug-ins.
</li>
<li>
Plug-ins are separate programs that communicate with the main GIMP program
using pipes.
</li>
<li>
Most of the plug-ins that are distributed with the GIMP are GPLed, but 
it is legal and possible to write proprietary plugins.
</li>
<li>
Except for plug-ins written in C, GIMP has extensions for writing filters and
scripts in Scheme, Perl, Python and other languages.
