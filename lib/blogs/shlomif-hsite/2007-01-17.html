<h2>www.shlomifish.org had been Link Spammed</h2>
<p>
Instead of the usual update on what's new on the site, this entry has
some news to convey. As it turns out, many of the pages on 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">http://www.shlomifish.org/</a> were
spammed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_in_blogs">link
    spam</a> to medications' sites. This is especially troubling because
the pages in question were static HTML pages, that were served unmodified
by the server from hard disk directory. This indicates that the server was
maliciously intruded and the files were modified. I encountered link spam 
before in wikis, weblogs and news sites, but this is the first time that I
witnessed a static HTML site getting spammed, and by cracking it.
</p>

<p>
The files's timestamps indicate that most files were changed on the 
1-December-2006 (probably by a script), but some files were modified as early 
as 23-December-2006, albeit in a slightly different way. The files were left 
spammed, because many resources on the site are not updated by the normal 
site update, and the links were kept hidden from visible eyes. It is still
unclear how the intruder gained access to run the script on the server.
</p>

<p>
The site was restored to its unaffected state, and preventive measures were
taken to mitigate the problem: passwords and keys were changed, and the site
now has a unified build system to the site that uploads all the relevant
resources from my home workstation to the server.
</p>

<p>
I also hope that next time this happens (if it does), my hosting and I have 
the appropriate measures in place to find out how it was done.
</p>

<p>
Now I can continue working on my home site and on my other projects.
