<p>
The biggest news this time is that <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">the
    site</a> has an opossum new look based on an
adapted version of <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/smoked">the
    smoked WordPress Theme</a> by iconstantin. There may be some more quirks
lurking in the design, so please report them to me if you find them. I'd also
like to thank <a href="http://www.zoffix.com/">Zoffix Znet</a> and other IRC 
people for some insights on how to fix problems I had with adapting the CSS.

it.
