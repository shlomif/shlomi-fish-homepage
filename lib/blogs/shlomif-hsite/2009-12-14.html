New text was added to <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Blue-Rabbit-Log/part-1.html"><i>The Blue Rabbit Log</i> screenplay</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[
A crowded pub in the role-played world. The Blue Rabbits enter.

</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Clover:</strong> OK, now that our horses are in the stable, we can get some rest. <span class="inlinedesc">[Hands
some coins to the pub-man]</span> Meals and drinks for the six of us.

</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Guy sitting on a stool at the bar (Guy #1):</strong> hey, I think I recognise you. You’re The
Blue Rabbit Adventuring company, right?
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Clover:</strong> yes, we are. <span class="inlinedesc">[does a rudimentary bow]</span> Clover, at your service!

</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Guy #1:</strong> hell, I ain’t need your service!
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Guy #2:</strong> yeah, we don’t need no adventurers’ service here.

</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Guy #1:</strong> yeah, problem with adventurers - they are trouble makers. They create
troubles where none exist before so they can solve them later.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Guy #2:</strong> yeah! <span class="inlinedesc">[and he shakes mugs with Guy #1]</span>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/art/">Computer Art page</a>
was made more semantic and accessible.
</p>

<p>
I added <a 
    href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/contributions/#mandriva">my
    contributions to Mandriva</a> to the page “Contributions Made to External
Open-Source Projects”.
</p>

<p>
A
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/numerical-software/">new
mini-directory of prominent Numerical Software</a> (currently heavily 
incomplete) has been added to 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/">Open Source 
resources section</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/shlomif.html">“shlomif”
collection of fortunes</a> which was getting very big and out of control
has span-out
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/sharp-perl.html">the
Freenode #perl fortune cookies</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/sharp-programming.html">Freenode
##programming fortune cookies</a>. There are some new fortunes there.
</p>

<p>
I added the text of 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/elephant-in-the-circus/">the parable of the Elephant in the Circus</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I once walked to a circus and saw a huge elephant tied to a small poll with a
rope, just standing there. So I wondered why is the elephant so obedient and
doesn’t break away from the stick with all of its enormous strength and mass.
So they told me this story: once when the elephant was very young, it was tied
to the pole the same way. Naturally, it didn’t like that and tried to escape,
but try as it might, the rope and the pole were too strong for it. So the
elephant eventually gave up.

Finally, the section navigation menus of the various sections are now 
formatted in a nice, expandable, GUI-like tree (assuming JavaScript is 
enabled). If JavaScript is not enabled, there’s a standard HTML fallback. This
is thanks to 
<a href="http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-treeview/">jQuery
    TreeView Plugin</a>
