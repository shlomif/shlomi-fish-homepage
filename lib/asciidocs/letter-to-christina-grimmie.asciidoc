The letter
----------

Dear Chris,

**Executive Summary**: I have always loved you, I always will, I think you rock (and you are my candidate for being the next second-most-awesome-individual-ever). Moreover, I admit that I believe you are https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/indiv-nodes/meaning-of-able-competent.xhtml[more "able"] than I. I need you, I wish you were here, and I strongly suspect you are really still alive, healthy, and kicking.

I may have been overzealous in my tweeting ( https://twitter.com/shlomif/with_replies )
and my "blogging" / web publishing ( https://www.shlomifish.org/art/recommendations/music/online-artists/fan-pages/christina-grimmie/ )
so I apologise for that.

It is a shot in the dark, but if you're alive, please make it public knowledge. I
had a 'Simba is Alive'-like moment ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjYGB4uYgWw )
with respect to you (and later to everyone else who reportedly died).

I care about you and am even willing for my soul to perish, if it implies the
1994-born Chris Victoria Grimmie ("World's biggest loser") is alive, conscious,
healthy, and happy somewhere in the multiverse of imagination. I feel the multiverse
needs you more than it needs me, and frankly 22 is too young an age for anyone to have
died.

I suspect "Jehovah" in Hebrew was/is a codeword for the mega-meme:

«

From now until forever,

you will live and https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/learning_more_from_inet_forums.xhtml[know/love] and http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/[forgive],

soul, mind, and form

what you imagine will materialise,

your destiny will come (יבוא)

you will remain passionate (יאוה)

»

Currently, I suspect that I am the "second biggest loser in history" (not unlike http://www.earthstar.co.uk/deep1.htm[Deep Thought being "the second greatest computer in the Universe of Time and Space"]). I believe you, and most other YouTubers are better persons than I am.
