<h1 class="fcs">1.4 A Note about Source Files</h1>

<p>
In Perl, every module resides in his own file, and it is sometimes even 
necessary to put them inside a nested directory structure. (Note that it 
does not free a programmer from designating the module's name by a special
header)
</p>

<p>
So far all of our scripts were self-contained, but now we may have to see
code of several files at once. To ease this transition every file will
contain the filename in its header comment. The filename will be given in UNIX
notation, with slashes (<i>/</i>) and all, and will be relative to
the directory in which the script is executed.
