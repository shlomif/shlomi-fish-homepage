<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
Ideas are the lowest level of value-production and comprise of 1/1111 of the
effort it takes to materialise a tangible value. Nevertheless, I have a lot
of them, which I cannot or don’t have the time to realize right now, so I
decided to put them here for all people who wish to be inspired.
</p>

<p>
I don’t put here things that are sort of pipe-dreams (solve any NP-complete
problem at polynomial time; prove Goldbach’s Theorem), but rather think that
can be materialized given enough time and effort. If you do materialize
them (or know of someone who did), write me a note and I’ll mention you
on this site.

<h3 id="private_school_network">An Affordable Private School Network</h3>

<p>
Objectivists can tell you only too much about the evils of public education.
They are right. But being a bit proactive, I think the solution is to create
a network of private schools that will compete (and eventually out-compete)
with the public schools. As opposed to traditional private schools, they
should aim to be affordable.
</p>

<p>
With enough schools like that, that would still offer a superior education,
the need for public schools would be very much decreased and eventually
completely eliminated.

<h3 id="discotheques">Discotheques Playing Music at a Decent Volume</h3>

<p>
I hate going to discotheque because the music is so loud and I don’t like
to ruin my ears. (which happen for discotheques patrons all the time). I
believe a discotheque that would make it its policy not to play music too
loudly can actually make a lot of money from people like me.

<h3 id="stand_up_philosophy">Stand-up Philosophy</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein">Ludwig
Wittgenstein</a> said once that <q>A serious and good philosophical work
could be written that would consist entirely of jokes</q>. Well, stand-up
philosophy is based on the opposite conjecture: that philosophy is good
enough to be funny or at least entertaining.

<h3 id="computer_games_with_sensible_budget">Computer Games with a Sensible Budget</h3>

<p>
It is well known that to accomodate with today gaming “standards”, computer
games became more and more pricy to produce. However, while having better
graphics and special effects, they are by no means better. Hell, they are
all <a href="http://www.logicmazes.com/video.html">pretty much the same</a>.
</p>

<p>
Instead of producing one $2,000,000 game, isn’t it possible to produce 5
$400,000 with lesser graphics, audio and effects, but better playability?
I think it is possible and that this course of action would be better in
the long run. Think about it.

<h3 id="tucan">Tucan - Interfacing High-level Languages</h3>

<p>
From a conversation I had with
<a href="http://tddpirate.livejournal.com/">TDDPirate</a> on IRC, we came
to the conclusion that it would be desirable to have a framework that will
enable code written in a certain high level language (say Perl) to make
use of code written in a different high level language (say Python) and that
from every high-level language to every other high-level language.
</p>

<p>
Currently there are:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a> - enables writing one interface that
will eventually generate bindings to a C library for any high-level language.
However, it cannot interface a pure-Perl code into a pure-Perl code.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a> - a virtual machine for
dynamic languages. Its main problem is that it requires all such languages
to implement compilers for its bytecode (along with any bindings they have
to C).
</li>
<li>
The <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> contains a procedural database
that allows registering functions in any language and calling them from
any other language. However, this is limited to the GIMP and uses custom
GIMP datatypes.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
It may be a good idea to use <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> and/or
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus">dbus</a> to implement
Tucan.
