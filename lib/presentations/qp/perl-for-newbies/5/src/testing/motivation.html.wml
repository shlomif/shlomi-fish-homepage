So why do we want to perform automated software testing? The
first is to prevent bugs. By writing tests before we write the production
code itself (so-called <b>Test-First Development</b>) we ascertain that the 
production code behaves according to the specification given in the tests.
That way, bugs that could occur, if the code was deployed right away, or
tested only manually, would be prevented.
</p>

<p>
Another reason is to make sure that bugs and regressions do not occur again.
Say we have a bug, and we write a meaningful test that fails when the bug is 
still in the code, and only then fix the bug. In that case, we can re-use the
test in the future to make sure the bug is not present in the current version
of the code. If the bug re-surfaces in a certain variation, then it will
likely be caught by the test.
</p>

<p>
Finally, by writing tests we provide specifications to the code and even
some form of API documentation, as well as examples of what we want the code 
to achieve. This causes less duplication than writing separate specification
documents and examples, and furthermore, is validated to be functional.
