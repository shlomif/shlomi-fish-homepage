#include 'template.wml'

<p>
Perl supports such mathematical operators as <tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>,
<tt>*</tt> (multiplication), and parenthesis (<tt>( ... )</tt>). An example
is worth a thousand words:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/expressions/operators.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
The output of this program is:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/expressions/operators.out.txt" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
The operators have the same precendence as their mathemtical equivalents. The
parenthesis are useful for making sure a sub-expression will be evaluated 
before all others do.

<h3>Note:</h3>

You can use commas to print more than one expression at once. It beats 
writing a separate <tt>print</tt> command for every expression you wish to 
output. However, for better readability, it is recommended that you will 
separate your expressions among several prints.
