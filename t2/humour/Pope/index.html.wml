<latemp_subject "The Pope Died on Sunday" />

<p>
An insane week in the life of an American female graphic artist named Rachel
Southern. A typical Hollywoodian story with some not-so-common elements.
This story (a novella) was originally written in Hebrew and is still
incomplete, with an ongoing translation to English by the author (translations
to other languages will be appreciated.).
</p>

<p>
This story is work in progress, so stay tuned and I’ll write it as time goes
by. Send your comments by E-mail to

<b>Note for 3-April-2005:</b> This story is unrelated to the recent
death of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II">Pope John
Paul II</a>. I wrote most of what you can find here several years ago
. Here’s <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/676">my
first announcement of its writing</a>. It’s not finished yet.

After a long time of almost complete neglect, I did some serious work on the
story. Many parts were seriously revamped, and new parts were added. Some of
the bits at the end were connected together.
</p>

<p>
Due to the change of the primary working environment (from Windows to Linux and
from Microsoft Word to OpenOffice.org),  there is now a change of available
formats. The drafts are now available in
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> .SXW, HTML, and PDF.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy!
