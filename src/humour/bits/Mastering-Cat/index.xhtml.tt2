<p>
Shlomi Fish, acclaimed author of <i>Mastering mv</i> and <i>Mastering rm</i>
has taken the time to sit down with us for an interview on his latest
book, <i>Mastering cat</i>. In this 344 pages-long book, Fish details
everything  you wanted to know about the UNIX <code>cat</code> command. We
decided to  have an interview with him to find out more about the
book’s motivation, content, and philosophy.
</p>

<p>
<b>O’Reilly Net</b>: Hi Shlomi!
</p>

<p>
<b>Shlomi Fish</b>: Hi!
</p>

<p>
<b>O’Reilly Net</b>: So, what has motivated you to write the book?
</p>

<p>
<b>Shlomi Fish</b>: Well, I realised people use <code>cat</code> so often
that they don’t take the time to fully investigate it and learn it.
For example, many people I worked with believed that <code>cat</code> can
only be used to output one file at a  time. So to output several files
they used something like:
</p>

<pre>
(cat file1.txt ; cat file2.txt ; cat file3.txt) | command
</pre>

<p>
The horror! cat accepts several files as arguments. So you can write
it as:
</p>

<pre>
cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt | command
</pre>

<p>
This has motivated me to write the book, to make people fully
understand the command.
</p>

<p>
<b>O’Reilly Net</b>: Isn’t mastering <code>cat</code> supposed to be quite
easy? Does it really necessitate its own book?
</p>

<p>
<b>Shlomi Fish</b>: Hell no! Mastering <code>cat</code> is not easy at all.
In fact, mastering <code>cat</code> is almost as difficult as herding cats.
</p>

<p>
For example, one case where I found that people truly
underestimate the power of cat is in the prefixing a line example. You
can do that with:
</p>

<pre>
echo "This would be the first line" | cat - myfile.txt &gt; myfile.txt.new
mv -f myfile.txt.new myfile.txt
</pre>

<p>
But people do not realize that and instead opted to use sed, awk, or
even perl (!). It can be taken further, of course. If the prefix is
already in its own file, you can simply use <code>cat prefix.txt
    myfile.txt</code>
</p>

<p>
Of course, if you want to append the same text to both the start and
the end of a file, you can’t do that with <code>cat - myfile.txt -</code>.
It simply doesn’t work that way. So, I end up explaining a lot about
UNIX pipeline concepts in the book.
</p>

<p>
<b>O’Reilly Net</b>: So what else does your book cover?
</p>

<p>
Well, I cover many things there. Among them are:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
History of the <code>cat</code> command.
</li>

<li>
Differences between the various <code>cat</code> implementations. (GNU,
the BSDs, System V, etc.)
</li>

<li>
<code>cat</code> equivalents in other operating systems (DOS, Win32,
VMS, OS/390, etc.)
</li>

<li>
Overview of the GNU cat codebase (for programmers).
</li>

</ol>

<p>
I’m also focusing on the various <code>cat</code> flags, which aid in its
interactive use. For example, the <code>-E</code>/<code>--show-ends</code>
flag, that places dollar signs at the end of the lines.
</p>

<p>
Aside from all that, I’m also covering
<a href="http://jl.photodex.com/dog/">dog</a> which is a program
that provides a superset of the <code>cat</code> program. I should also
mention <code>mouse</code> which aimed to provide an even greater
superset, and was never released. Rumours say some parts of it are
based on code of the leaked Windows 2000 sources.
</p>

<p>
<b>O’Reilly Net</b>: Your book seems bound to be popular (for some
values of popularity). What can we expect from you next?
</p>

<p>
<b>Shlomi Fish</b>: Well, I hope many people will buy the book, or
read it online so they’ll be educated about <code>cat</code>. If you like
<i>Mastering cat</i>, look forward to my next book - <i>Mastering echo</i>. I
expect it to be published next fall.
