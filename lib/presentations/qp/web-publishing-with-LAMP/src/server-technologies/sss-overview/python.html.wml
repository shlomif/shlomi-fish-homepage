<li>
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> is an interpreted language, that
competes for the same niche as Perl and has similar capabilities.
</li>
<li>
However, it has a completely different philosophy with different syntax and
conventions.
</li>
<li>
It has a "There's one way to do it" Philosophy which enables people to
understand and modify each other's code. (contrast to Perl's "There's more than
one way to do it.")
</li>
<li>
Uses whitespace for indentation, which makes embedding it inside text
templates more difficult.
</li>
<li>
Somewhat slower than Perl in most cases, but still quite fast enough
for most needs.
