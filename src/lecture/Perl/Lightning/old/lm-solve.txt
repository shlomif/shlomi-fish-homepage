LM-Solve is a program that automatically solves various kinds of Logic Mazes.
Someone once referred me to the "Theseus and Minotaur" maze, and I spent
several good hours solving it. I then wrote a script to automatically solve it
for me and it worked very nicely. A search on Google revealed there were other
mazes of this kind, and I wrote another script for the so-called "Alice Mazes".

I then integrated the functionality of the Minotaur script into the Alice
script by using several classes that inherit from the same base class, and
supply it with riddle-specific characteristics. Since then support for other
puzzle types was added, the most hard to implement being the Planks in the
Swamp Puzzles.

By writing LM-Solve I became more familiar with processing command line options
with Getopt::Long and using Pod::Usage and friends. I also used Makefile.PL and
integrated an RPM Spec.

After I ran into a few of CVS' limitations, I decided to use BitKeeper and
the bkbits.net service instead. I was very impressed and happy with it, but
had to stop using it, after a license change was announced, that made me
unable to use it any longer.
