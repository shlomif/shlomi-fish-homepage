#include 'template.wml'

<p>
Perl provides a shortcut for writing "$myvar = $myvar + $value", or
"$myvar = $myvar / $value" and similar operations. Here's an example:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/variables/plus-equal1.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>

<p>
Since the operations <tt>$a += 1</tt> and <tt>$a -= 1</tt> are so commonly used, 
they were also assigned a separate operator. One can use <tt>$a++</tt> and 
<tt>$a--</tt> to perform them. For example, the above program could have 
been written as:
</p>

<quadpres_code_block>
<quadpres_include_colorized_file filename="src/variables/plus-equal2.pl" />
</quadpres_code_block>
