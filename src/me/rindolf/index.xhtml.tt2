<p>
I, Shlomi Fish, have decided to allow people on and off [% IRC %] to call me
“Rindolf”, due to the fact that some non-Hebrew inclined people have problems
with my private name - <a href="[% base_path %]meta/FAQ/#your_name">“Shlomi”</a>.
Some common pet names for Rindolf include “Rin”,
“Rinny”, “Rindy”, “Rinfold”, etc.

<p>
Rindolf was a dwarven warrior that I played in an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Advanced_Dungeons_.26_Dragons_2nd_edition">AD&amp;D 2nd edition</a> session. I
came up with this name as appropriate for a dwarf probably out of thinking of
other common Germanic names such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randolph_%28given_name%29">Randolph</a>
(literally “Shield+Wolf” in Germanic) or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_%28name%29">Rudolph</a>
(literally “famous wolf”), and it had a nice ring to it. Rindolf ended up
becoming my
favourite tabletop Role playing games character of all time as a youth.
However, he ended up dying in a battle with a
<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Doppelganger">Doppleganger</a>, in
what was the Broken Shaft Adventuring Company’s best adventure (but a deadly
one), in part due to a misunderstanding between the game master and me. This
death proved to be a big shock on me (= Shlomi), and part of me felt guilty
about the death of my character which I felt was not real enough to warrant
grieving on. I was wrong.
</p>

<p>
Later on, at Internet chat sessions, after first using the nickname “dori” and
then switching to “gloin”
(= two of the Dwarves from Tolkien’s
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit"><i>The Hobbit</i></a>)
I settled on “rindolf”, which I felt was the most original nickname, and part
of my individuality.

<p>
After I started talking intensively on [% IRC %] at around 2003 and 2004, especially
on the <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode network</a>, which I can
still recommend, a few people teased me for being one of Santa Claus’s
red-nosed reindeer or his “reingeek” or whatever. This was done by reference to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer">Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer</a> and his oft-cited brother “Randolph”. At first,
I found it annoying, but after a while decided to take it to my advantage.
</p>

<p>
As a result, the new Rindolf has become the Evil twin brother of
Rudolph and Randolph, Santa’s goody-two-shoes reindeer, who are among
his arch-enemies. He is also one of the cornerstones of the Evil Reindeer
Evil World Domination Evil Conspiracy, which aims to spread Evil in general
and Reindeer Evil in particular around the world.

<p>
Some people told me the name “Rindolf” reminds them of that of
<a href="http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Gandalf">Gandalf</a> from the Middle
Earth world of J. R. R. Tolkien. I decided to take it to my advantage too,

Rindolf has devised The Rindolf Algorithm, which is a sophisticated encryption

I came up with a different midrash during an extended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania">Mania</a> period,
where as a boy I was asked to pick a nickname and
said "What is the name of this dog? [answer: Rin Tin Tin] And of this dog? [answer: Dolf] 'Rin Tin Tin' plus 'Dolf': 'Rindolf!'. That sounds like the name of one of your dwarves, <a href="https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Rupert_Giles">Giles</a>! 'Rindolf the Bearded'!"

<p>
Not only is Rindolf an evil Reindeer, but he is also the notorious insane
tyrant and mass-murderer, Rindolf “Aim Very High” Hitlower. As you may have
guessed, people said that my nickname “Rindolf” reminded them of “Adolf
Hitler”, and even though I was offended by it for a long time, I eventually
decided to take it to my advantage, too. Recently (Late June, 2014) I’ve told
people that I decided that in my personal and professional life, I will <b>aim
very high</b> in the hope that I will hit the aim or perhaps a little lower,
and so settled on this nickname.

the lovely and real-life
<a href="[% base_path %]humour/bits/facts/Summer-Glau/">Summer Glau</a>, became an
“apple that completely supplanted the tree”.
</p>

<p>
I realised that she likely wants to be the hacker monarch even more badly
than I have, throughout all the years I was the hacker king of the world.
The hacker monarch is also known as “The <b>Best of the Best of the Best</b>” to
paraphrase on the excellent film
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_in_Black_%28film%29"><i>Men

awesomeness.

At age 37 (I am 1977 born), I feel <b>younger</b> than ever, more and more

(<b>2014-Sep-07</b>)
Following the <a href="http://unarmed.shlomifish.org/3001.html">call for
action</a> for “Finishing
Off The Open Content / Web 2.0 Revolution (#SummerNSA)”, I have become tired of
remaining <b>The</b> Hacker monarch.  As a result, I mentally decided to quit
prematurely and let the whole world go to hell.  This was done per advice of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall</a>,
who was the wonderful The Hacker King of the Open Source/Usenet revolution
(~1983-1997), and quite The Invisible as well (by choice).
</p>

<p>
After feeling vindictive and resentful for a while (which I knew by
experience was a transitional feeling and that I should not act upon it),
I realised something. What I realised was that Summer Glau, being the
legendary Bajoran profile, “The Sexiest <b>Terminator</b> Ever”, just
terminated the whole obsession of me and other people with a small group being
“<b>The</b> Hacker Monarch” and instead there are now more than one
potential “Hacker Monarchs”. And to that I am grateful to her.
</p>

<p>
(FFFFUUUU <a href="http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Rainbow_Dash">Rainbow Dash</a>
-like people, who always think there should be one, and only one, winner in a
competition.)
</p>

<p>
Therefore, I plan on remaining <b>an</b> awesome hacker monarch for the
foreseeable future, and will be joined by Ms. Glau and by other people who are
willing to play that role. Perhaps future historians will designate some people
in particular as being that in the present, but such global
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superlative">superlatives</a>
probably ought to die for now.
</p>

<p>
(Also see how previously
the fictional Selina Mandrake, being The <b>Dispeller</b>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/ongoing-text.html#from-dispeller-to-selina">dispelled</a> the whole ordeal with assigning
superlative profiles.)
</p>

<p>
I still plan on <b>passing</b> that d10 die to Summer in person with much
fanfare, because it's now her property. And I am still planning on becoming a
successful, rich, and famous, writer/entertainer/philosopher and
screenwriter. Remember the name: Shlomi “Rindolf” Fish!

<li>
<p>
Rindolf the Dwarf’s cry of competence was “Me, Rindolf!” which is now also
echoed in the URL of this page - <code>/me/rindolf/</code>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Rindolf the Dwarf was nicknamed “Woman-hands” because his hands were as
delicate as those of a female dwarf.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Rindolf’s weapons of choice were <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Light_Pick">the pick</a>
and <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Shortbow">the shortbow</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I later played Rindolf in a small game master+two players adventure, where he
sported much better abilities than the original character. After going through
the adventure and winning over all the enemies, Rindolf ended up wearing
a <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Helm_of_Opposite_Alignment">Helm
of Opposite Alignment</a> which made him convert from a “Neutral Good”
alignment to a Neutral Evil one, and he ended up killing his comrade for the
adventure.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Rindolf the Evil Reindeer is Norwegian, but he speaks in a French accent,
because I cannot emulate a Norwegian accent properly, and because French
is the language of love and “Love is Evil, and Evil is Love”.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
On a Freenode chat we joked that "shlomif" was Rindolf's MoreEvil™ twin
brother.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
We also joked that Rindolf the dwarf plays Shlomi Fish in an
Advanced 21st-Century Earth Adventures campaign.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Rudolph, Randolph, and Rindolf, are not a triplet, but rather twins. I
can't figure out how it works ( 😉 ).
