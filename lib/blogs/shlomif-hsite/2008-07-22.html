New text has been added to <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">the
    screenplay Star Trek: “We, the Living Dead”</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
            [
        There’s a cat lying on a table there content. He’s half-white and half-grey.
            ]
        </p>

<p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> oh, look! A cat. <span class="inlinedesc">[She approaches the cat and starts petting it.]</span>
</p>
<p>
            [
        The cat purrs and then says:
            ]
        </p>
<p><strong class="sayer">George the Cat:</strong> oh, yeah!

</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Startled]</span> Bleh, you’re a talking cat.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">George:</strong> yes, but why did you stop?
</p>

<p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> I’m not used to cats talking to me.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">George:</strong> ah, well, yes, it takes some pre-vampires time to get used to that
here.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> I suppose you’re older than me.
</p>

<p><strong class="sayer">George:</strong> most probably. I’m about 5 milliard years old.
</p>
<p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> bleh!! You’re older than my planet!

<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#met_a_guy_in_the_bar">Two
    of my newest aphorisms</a> were added to
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html">the
    Aphorism collection</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Two female dogs talking about modern-life:
</p>

<p>
<b>Jasmine:</b> It’s so cool! On the Internet, no one knows you’re a dog!
</p>

<p>
<b>Daisy:</b> Yeah, but everyone can tell right away that you’re a bitch!

The first revision of a new essay -
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/software-management/perfect-workplace/">“The
    Perfect IT Workplace”</a> was published. It was released
pre-maturely due to someone redditing the article, but may still
be of interest:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>The Best Tools that Money Can Buy</b></p>
<p>
This cannot stressed enough. As <a class="ulink" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">Joel Spolsky notes</a> (based
on Steve McConnell) in item No. 9 of the Joel
Test, you need to “use the best tools that money can buy”.
</p>
<p>
If you buy old, broken and/or barely functioning hardware,
you’ll spend a lot of time debugging the problems there,
which will waste a lot of precious time. And you may
lose a lot of reputation and customers due to down-time.
<span class="bold"><strong>Relying on reliable, high-end
    hardware</strong></span> is a much
better idea.
</p><p>
I’ve been to two workplaces that gave me an old
computer with a 40 GB hard-disk. It wasn’t enough at
all. At one place, we’ve reached the limit of this
hard-disk due to several large source code checkouts,
and as a result needed a bigger hard-disk. And the
only hard-disks the lab had were 80 GB ones, which were
bought because they were the cheapest (per-disk, not
per-capacity). Please, <span class="bold"><strong>buy
    large enough hard-disks</strong></span>.
</p>
<p>
At the same workplace, I was given a computer with a
read-only CD-ROM drive. It was not even a DVD reader.
I brought a DVD of audio files from home, and could not
read it. In this day and age, read/write DVD drives
are the standard, and are ultra-cheap.
