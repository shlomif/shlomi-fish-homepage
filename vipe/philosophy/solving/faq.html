        <h1>The Solving FAQ</h1>
        <h2>Solving and its foundations</h2>

        <h3>What is Solving?</h3>

    <p>
    Solving is a toolkit for gradually changing an existing democratic
    regime into a Linux-like regime without a trace of Fascism or Socialism or
    other types of force. Solving is founded on the following seminal works:
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">The Catehdral and the Bazaar</a> - A must read for everybody. Even if you don't anything 
    about programming nor care too in the near future.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.neo-tech.com/orientation/">The Neo-Tech Orientation 
    and Definition</a> - the "data structures" of Neo-Tech. Read this, and
    you won't usually need the rest of Neo-Tech.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.neo-tech.com/advantages/">The Neo-Tech Advantages</a> -
    a seminal work by Frank R. Wallace, that illustrates step by step how 
    <b>you</b> unnecessarily complicate your life. And how people methodically
    usarp other people by manipulating the same false concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
    Nevertheless, there are some places where Solving deviates from both, 
    especially from the mainstream Neo-Tech view. More strategically than 
    semantically.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the origin of the name?</h3>

    <p>
    I once wrote a document entitled "How to Solve all of Israel's Problems in
    Little Less than Two Years". I named the file solving.doc (it was an 
    MS-Word file) I sent it to a friend of mine, who responded with a 
    critique of it with the subject "Solving".
    </p>

    <p>
    That Solving had an error of having a top-down-dependant approach. This 
    Solving (version 0.2.0 and above) has no such requirements. But I still like the name.
    </p>

    <h2>Neo-Tech</h2>

    <h3>How does solving deviates from Neo-Tech?</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
        Works Bottom-Up as well as Top-Down.
        </li>
        <li>
        Much more proactive.
        </li>
        <li>
        Adopts the model of the Linux world as a model for government.
        </li>
        <li>
        Bazaar Style.
        </li>
        <li>
        Not trying to keep or maintain purity of interests. (implication of 
        Linux and the bother style). 
        </li>
        <li>
        A breeze let's act now, but take the time to do it right view.
        </li>
        <li>
        Money/Power/Love? %-) Most people just want to be happy. I'm not 
        addressing titans. I'm addressing the masses. Making them small-time 
        titans.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Why Neo-Tech? Why not plain Objectivism?</h3>

    <p>
    Objectivists who don't know Neo-Tech are bound to re-invent it, and 
    many times badly. Sometimes, they are so busy blaming the world (including
    business titans) for their own problems. People who don't know Objectivism 
    are bound to re-invent it, and many times very badly. Let's face it: there 
    isn't a better alternative.
    </p>

    <h3>Why a different name?</h3>

    <p>
    The September 11 Neo-Tech Note was laughable. It made me shiver and afraid
    for the while. Now I'm sure I have a silver bullet for all political 
    problems. So I call it Solving to distiniguish it from Neo-Tech. I call 
    the "maintstream" Neo-Tech folks as well as everybody else who wants to 
    change things for the best quietly and nicely to join the Solving 
    architecture.
    </p>

    <h3>I don't entirely agree with everything Neo-Tech says?</h3>

    <p>
    That's OK. I need people who after reading the Neo-Tech Orientation and 
    Definitions say to themselves "wow" or at least "interesting". I need 
    people who believe in at least one libertarian cause. I need people who
    like to think, and accept unorthodox views. I simply need people with
    attitude.
    </p>

    <p>
    BTW, if the Neo-Tech Orientation and Definitions did not teach you 
    anything you did not know, then you are definitely the right guy (
    or gal) for me.
    </p>

    <h2>Linux</h2>

    <h3>What is Linux?</h3>

    <p>
    Linux is the best organizational model to exist in the history of 
    man-kind. It is the name of a community, a coalition, and a philosophy.
    (It also happens to be an operating system kernel, and an operating
    system built around it, but that's beside our point).
    </p>

    <p>
    If you wish to know why Linux is so successful, then "The Magic Cauldron"
    by Eric S. Raymond will answer all your questions.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What is wrong about Linux?</h3>

    <p>
    The main thing wrong with the Linux community is that they don't realize
    their power and restrict themselves to software. Solving aims to be
    Linux' answer to Politics. I chose a different name in order to 
    satisfy the (narrow-headed, IMHO) people who just wish to get their
    job done and/or write code.
    </p>

    <h3>Linux is Communism, isn't it?</h3>

    <p>
    Linux is about organized <b>voluntary</b> sharing. Communism puts a gun
    to your head and tell you: share. Many companies, especially Microsoft,
    would like you to believe that they are the last hope of Capitalism 
    fighting against a non-centralized mass of developers, users and
    people who benefit from Open-Source. However, two things must be 
    remembered:
    </p>

    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Most software produced is internal software, embedded software,
        or such that is bundeled by hardware. Linux aims to be a replacement
        for commercial shrinkwrap software.
        </li>
        <li>
        Even in a world where there are many open-source alternatives,
        there is still some room for proprietary software. (see for
        example what Joel Spolsky says about FogBUGZ at the beginning of
        <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000348.html">Rub a dub dub</a>.)
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
    Free software saves people time, money and frustration. Communism causes
    people to lose time, money and makes them very much frustrated.
    </p>
    
    <h2>OK, I got you. Now what do I do?</h2>

    <h3>How will solving operate?</h3>
    
    <p>
    Start a Solving user group (SUGs), or join an existing one. Start voluntary
    alternatives to government monopolies. Write an article, lecture, etc. about    Neo-Tech or Open-Source/Free Software and put it online. A lecture is 
    preferable because teaching is the best way of learning. Seriously.
    </p>

    <p>
    Don't debate for debate's cause. Debate to reach conclusions. 
    Avoid half-truths and half-ways. Etc. Etc. Avoid Objectivists Dogmas. Ayn 
    Rand is often misinterpreted. And "Altruism" is not necessarily a bad word 
    as it can mean both contributing to society and telling people that it is
    important/compulsory/whatever to contribute.

    <p>
    Don't be afraid of life and don't be afraid of living. I don't mean go 
    skidiving. I mean saying what's on your mind, and aiming to be a 
    torchlight for society rather than a reflection of it.

    <p>
    Produce, but don't be worried if you don't "produce" anything for days.
    First, do not harm. After that, everything else is optional. Your product
    is not your worth. 

    <h3>I don't have time to get involved?</h3>

    <p>
    In that case, you need better time management. Did you wonder how
    Holywood stars have time for giving all these interviews? That's because
    they know how to manage their time properly. If your job demands you
    to work extra hours constantly and stuff like that, then maybe you 
    are better off finding another job. As far as software is concerned, 
    the Peopleware and Extreme Programming methodologies suggest an
    employer to make sure the employee works always a 40 hours week no
    matter how much pressure he has at work. Working overtime has proved
    to be very ineffective.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you want to get inolved, then you would better make sure you find
    the time.
    </p>

    <h3>Why should I bother?</h3>

    <p>
    Refer to the Modified Parable of Yotam:
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>The plants have gone to elect a king. They went to the vine and asked
        him: "would you be our king?". The vine replied: "I have grapes to grow
        , so I don't really have time for being your king. Sorry" They
        went to the Fig and asked him the same. The Fig replied: "Sorry, but
        I need to grow figs and big leaves, so I really can't.". And so it went
        on. After the ten or so plants, the Vine said: "This is getting 
        ridiculus. Fine, forget the grapes. I'll be your king."</i>
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>The Vine was very quickly able to organize the plants that well, that
        they did not have to consult him on anything. Ever. Thus, while he
        was still technically the king, he had plenty of time to grow grapes,
        without missing a single season.</i>
    </p>

    <h3>I do not agree with everything that Neo-Tech says</h3>

    <p>
    You don't have to. If you think something that Neo-Tech suggests is
    good, you are welcome to act for it. We will not force people to 
    do something against their will. But you have to be open to different
    views, and not think left-wing, right-wing, the Bible or whatever
    is necessarily the "absolute truth". 
    </p>

    <p>
    Neo-Tech does not wish to make everybody believe in what it says. It
    does not wish to make everybody business titans. Its only purpose 
    is to make sure everybody are value producers: happy, productive people
    who do not methodically harm anybody or poison people's mind with a lot
    of dogma and non-sequitors. If at time infinity, there would be some 
    people who actively oppose Neo-Tech, but otherwise don't harm anyone, 
    they will be left alone. Solving does not try to make everybody into
    Objectivists. It tries to make sure everybody are happy. And I mean
    <b>everybody</b>.
    </p>

    <h3>Anything more concrete?</h3>

    <p>
    Sure <b>Open Patents a.k.a Free Patents</b> - patents done right 
    (universe-wide, common sense, easily revokable if a prior art is found, 
    exclusion of self prior art, cannot be hardened a posteriori, and 
    public upon consemption, trade secrets may serve as prior art, but otherwise
    a patent is void.) And a friendly, helpful community of patenters who are
    experienced laymen and not lawyers. Note that Free Patents are by no means
    a complete replacement for traditional patents. They are an alternative
    way of doing things. I will support converting traditional patents to
    Open Patents a-posteriori.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    And now it's up to you to think of better alternatives which I'll put
    here if I like.
