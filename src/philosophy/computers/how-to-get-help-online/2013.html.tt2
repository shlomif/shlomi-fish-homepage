<p>
<b>Don Marti</b> - for providing some
<a href="http://zgp.org/pipermail/linux-elitists/2013-November/013703.html">useful
feedback</a> about an early version of this article, after I requested comments
by posting to
<a href="http://zgp.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/linux-elitists">the
“linux-elitists” mailing list</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>A.</b> (an Instant Messaging and [% my_acronym( "key" => "IRC",) %] friend of mine) - for encouraging me to
try to feature the article on Slashdot, after a chat, during which we concluded
that [% my_acronym( "key" => "IRC",) %] was an incredibly useful Internet medium for getting help, yet many
people were oblivious to it.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>U.</b> - for referring me to wikiHow as a potentially more effective way
for writing tutorials. He showed me
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Help-With-Linux">its
“How to Get Help with Linux (14 Steps)” feature</a>, which we both agreed
was currently poorly written. I contemplated writing a similar feature to mine
in wikiHow style, but decided to publish this feature in its current format
as it is.

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://alanhieu.ml/"><b>Alan Haggai Alavi</b></a> - for going
over the article, and pointing out some potential spelling and grammar errors.
