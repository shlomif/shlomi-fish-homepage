<h2>Recent Note</h2>

<p>
I discovered some misinformation in this puzzle, which was corrected,
and added an explanation of how to reach the solution.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
I originally wrote this puzzle for a Role-Playing Game tournament of my
friends’ local RPG club, back when I was in high school. It does not require
any knowledge in Fantasy Role Playing Games to solve.
</p>

<h2>The Puzzle Itself</h2>

<p>
There are five members in the council of Ravensborg’s Guild. Two of them
are thieves, two wizards and one warrior, that got there due to a wrong
number. It is known that thieves always lie; wizards say one true statements
and one false out of every two statements they utter, and warriors
always say the truth.
</p>

<p>
Can you find out according to the statements of the council members, the
profession of each one and who is the guild’s leader?
</p>

<table class="logic_sayings">

<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Statements</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Simon</td>
<td>
<ol>
<li>One of the thieves is Krenin.</li>
<li>The leader is a wizard.</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Lamber</td>
<td>
<ol>
<li>I am a thief.</li>
<li>I am not the leader.</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Krenin</td>
<td>
<ol>
<li>I am the leader</li>
<li>Rupert is a warrior.</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Walter</td>
<td>
<ol>
<li>Our warrior is Rupert.</li>
<li>Our warrior is the leader.</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Rupert</td>
<td>
<ol>
<li>Lamber is one of the thieves.</li>
<li>Our leader is one of the wizards.</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The solution can be found below.
</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 50em">Solution</h2>

<p>
Lamber says he is a thief. If he were a thief, he would lie about it,
and if he were the warrior he would not say he was a thief. So he must be
a wizard whose statement #1 is false, and his #2 statement is true.
</p>

<p>
Rupert says that Lamber is a thief, so he’s lying in his #1 statement. So
he cannot be a warrior. Thus, Krenin and Walter are lying in their #2
and #1 statements respectively , and they cannot be warriors either. So the only
one who can be a warrior is Simon.
</p>

<p>
Simon testifies in his two true statements that Krenin is a thief and
that the leader is a wizard. So Krenin is a thief. Rupert in statement #2
testifies that their leader is a wizard, so this is a true statement
and he is a wizard. So Walter is a thief.
</p>

<p>
Now, since the leader is a wizard, and because Lamber is a wizard, and
he testifies in statement #2 that he is not the leader, then the leader must
be Rupert.
</p>

<p>
To sum up the results:

<tr>
<td>Lamber</td>
<td>Wizard</td>

<td>Thief</td>

<tr>
<td>Rupert</td>
<td>Wizard (Leader)</td>
