{{Wilde|Enterprise Content Management! Yeah!!!|Freecell Solver}}


Freecell Solver is an [[industrial strength]] [[Enterprise]] [[Content Management]] System. Freecell Solver™ utilises the NP-completeness of [[Freecell]] to solve the complex problem of enterprise content management.

== Features and Performance ==

Freecell Solver requires a 32-way [[big iron]] machine, with 1024 Gigabytes of RAM, and liquid nitrogen cooling. With this configuration, it can handle one request every 100 hours, which consist of one hour of processing, and 99 hours to reboot and re-install the system (manually). Its pages are compatible only with [[Microsoft]] [[Internet Explorer]] 6.0.126r5334 running on [[Windows ME]]. A port to [[Firefox]] 2.0.0.5 is in the works.

Freecell Solver accepts as input the following formats:

* [[Microsoft Word]] '97 .doc files.
* Microsoft Windows Card-files.
* Corrupted Microsoft Access .mdb files. Non-corrupted Access files should not be lest they will causes Freecell Solver to become corrupted.

Support for more formats is planned in the future.

Freecell Solver is written by hand in [[Java]] JRE assembly, which is then translated by hand to .NET CLR Assembly, only to be run by a Java-based interpreter running on a non-JIT Java interpreter. It consists of approximately 100,000 Million lines of code (excluding comments and whitespace), that are generated by a 100-line [[Perl]] script.
