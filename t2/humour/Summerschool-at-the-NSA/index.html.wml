<b>Note:</b> while considering myself a mostly Objectivist, and while I enjoyed
reading <i>The Fountainhead</i> and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>, I reject
Classical Randianism as unfitting for 2013 and forward, and
<a href="$(ROOT)/humour/stories/">my other stories</a> and more serious
writings reflect a more modern mentality, including
